2.22}, {"text": "it's three times bigger.", "start": 327.24, "duration": 1.4}, {"text": "And so what you've got to do", "start": 328.64, "duration": 1.22}, {"text": "is you actually got to\ndivide by that coefficient,", "start": 329.86, "duration": 2.55}, {"text": "which oftentimes we just\nwrite as a fraction instead.", "start": 332.41, "duration": 2.23}, {"text": "So you would kind of just put a
