the ones that work just fine, like the ones you cross every day, like on your commute?", "start": 13.64, "duration": 4.22}, {"text": "If you\u2019ve ever stopped to take a look, you might notice that there are cracks in the concrete.", "start": 17.86, "duration": 3.78}, {"text": "These cracks are a few centimeters thick, and they contain what looks like some kind of metal grating.", "start": 21.64, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "The cracks and grating are there for a reason:", "start": 26.66, "duration": 2.12}, {"text": "They\u2019re called expansion joints, and without them, the bridges would probably have failed a long time ago.", "start": 28.78, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "If there are bridges in your town, they probably\nhave expansion joints, too.", "start": 33.5, "duration": 3.5}, {"text": "So why are these ugly metal cracks necessary?", "start": 37.0, "duration": 2.519}, {"text": "The answer has to do with thermodynamics: the study of temperature, and how it affects matter.", "start": 39.52, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "[Theme Music]", "start": 44.24, "duration": 12.84}, {"text": "So what is temperature, anyway?", "start": 57.08, "duration": 1.88}, {"text": "At the most basic level, temperature is a measure of how much kinetic energy -- that is, the energy of motion -- is in a system.", "start": 58.96, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "The hotter something is, the higher its temperature.", "start": 64.96, "duration": 2.48}, {"text": "It has more kinetic energy, because its atoms\nand molecules are moving around more.", "start": 67.44, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "And the easiest way to figure out if there\u2019s a temperature difference between two systems is through heat transfer.", "start": 71.64, "duration": 5.56}, {"text": "The hotter system will always transfer heat\nto the colder one.", "start": 77.2, "duration": 2.86}, {"text": "And if there\u2019s no heat transfer between\nsystems at all, that\u2019s called thermal equilibrium.", "start": 80.07, "duration": 4.79}, {"text": "But usually, there will be some heat transfer, because that\u2019s how the temperature of a system changes.", "start": 84.86, "duration": 4.539}, {"text": "And when the temperature of an object changes,\nit can undergo what\u2019s known as thermal expansion.", "start": 89.399, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "Usually, an increase in temperature will make a solid expand, and a decrease in temperature will make it contract.", "start": 93.66, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "Now, there are two main ways that the dimensions of a solid can change, based on a change in temperature.", "start": 99.5, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "It can increase or decrease in length; or\nit can increase or decrease in volume.", "start": 103.58, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "These changes in length and volume work in a very similar way to the changes in length and volume from stress and strain, that we talked about in our episode on statics.", "start": 107.42, "duration": 6.9}, {"text": "In the case of a bridge, the change is in\nits length -- what\u2019s known as linear expansion.", "start": 114.32, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "And the equation that we use to describe linear expansion, says that the change in length is equal to what\u2019s known as the coefficient of linear expansion", "start": 118.78, "duration": 6.86}, {"text": "x the initial length x the change in temperature", "start": 125.64, "duration": 2.82}, {"text": "So let\u2019s break down that equation to see\nhow it works.", "start": 128.46, "duration": 2.48}, {"text": "The longer the bridge is to start with, the\nmore it will expand or contract.", "start": 130.94, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "And the greater the temperature change, the\nmore it will also expand or contract.", "start": 134.42, "duration": 3.8}, {"text": "The only other thing that the change in length depends on is that coefficient of linear expansion, represented by the Greek letter alpha.", "start": 138.22, "duration": 6.42}, {"text": "The value for that coefficient depends on the material, and the higher the coefficient is, the more the length of the material will change in response to a change in temperature.", "start": 144.64, "duration": 8.46}, {"text": "And that\u2019s why bridges have expansion joints:", "start": 153.1, "duration": 2.22}, {"text": "to give the concrete room to expand when it\u2019s warmer outside, and contract back down in cooler weather.", "start": 155.32, "duration": 5.38}, {"text": "Without expansion joints, the concrete would\nexperience much more stress,", "start": 160.7, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "and you\u2019d be much more likely to end up\nwith a broken bridge.", "start": 164.36, "duration": 2.9}, {"text": "And the same principles apply to other kinds\nof expansion.", "start": 167.27, "duration": 2.86}, {"text": "Volume expansion is just like linear expansion, except that the change happens in all three dimensions.", "start": 170.13, "duration": 4.95}, {"text": "The equation for volume expansion just says\nthat the change in volume is", "start": 175.08, "duration": 3.34}, {"text": "equal to the coefficient of volume expansion, times the initial volume, times the change in temperature.", "start": 178.42, "duration": 5.4}, {"text": "As with linear expansion, the bigger the object is in the first place, the more it\u2019ll expand or contract.", "start": 183.82, "duration": 5.42}, {"text": "And a greater temperature change will lead\nto a greater change in volume.", "start": 189.24, "duration": 2.96}, {"text": "Finally, the volume change depends on how much of a tendency any particular material has to expand or contract.", "start": 192.2, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "That's its coefficient of volume expansion\n-- represented by the Greek letter beta.", "start": 198.6, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "But changes in temperature don\u2019t only affect\nsolids; they also affect gases.", "start": 202.86, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "And in gases, temperature has a direct bearing\non the pressure, volume, and amount of the gas;", "start": 206.82, "duration": 5.4}, {"text": "all four of those properties are related to\none another.", "start": 212.22, "duration": 2.34}, {"text": "If you\u2019ve taken a chemistry course, like maybe the one Hank hosted, you\u2019re probably already familiar with the concept of an ideal gas:", "start": 214.56, "duration": 6.44}, {"text": "a hypothetical gas that obeys a certain set of rules, which lets you describe it more simply.", "start": 221.0, "duration": 4.42}, {"text": "So, what are these rules?", "start": 225.42, "duration": 1.26}, {"text": "Well, an ideal gas is made up of lots of molecules\nthat move around randomly.", "start": 226.68, "duration": 3.42}, {"text": "As they\u2019re zooming around, those molecules\nmight collide, and bounce off one another,", "start": 230.1, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "but they\u2019ll exert no other forces on each\nother, outside of these collisions.", "start": 233.82, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "And, the volume of all the gas molecules combined is very small, compared to the volume of the container.", "start": 237.2, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "And in many cases, a real gas is close enough\nto an ideal gas, that these assumptions apply.", "start": 241.72, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "Which means that we can use the equations that describe ideal gases to describe the behavior of lots of real-life situations, too.", "start": 246.18, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "And each of these laws is named after a uniquely awesome individual who lived hundreds of years ago.", "start": 252.24, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "The first is called Boyle\u2019s Law.", "start": 256.8, "duration": 1.76}, {"text": "And it says that as you increase the pressure of a gas while holding the temperature constant,", "start": 258.56, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "the volume of the gas will go down -- and\nvice versa.", "start": 263.02, "duration": 2.64}, {"text": "When you increase the pressure, you\u2019re squeezing the molecules together, so they occupy less space.", "start": 265.66, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "The second basic law is called Charles\u2019s\nLaw, and it says that:", "start": 270.64, "duration": 2.96}, {"text": "as you increase the temperature of a gas while holding the pressure constant, the volume of the gas will go up -- and vice versa.", "start": 273.6, "duration": 6.28}, {"text": "Raising the temperature of the gas gives the molecules more energy, which means they can rocket around more forcefully, expanding the size of the container.", "start": 279.88, "duration": 6.98}, {"text": "So far, we\u2019ve talked about how the properties of an ideal gas relate to each other when you hold the temperature constant, and when you hold the pressure constant.", "start": 286.86, "duration": 6.9}, {"text": "So you can probably guess what the third law\nis for: it\u2019s called Gay-Lussac\u2019s Law,", "start": 293.76, "duration": 3.8}, {"text": "and it says that as you increase the temperature of a gas, while holding the volume constant, the pressure of the gas will go up -- and vice versa.", "start": 297.56, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "What\u2019s happening here is that the increase in temperature again gives the gas molecules more energy and a higher speed.", "start": 304.28, "duration": 5.58}, {"text": "But this time, the size of the container is\nfixed.", "start": 309.86, "duration": 3.06}, {"text": "So the molecules hit the sides of the container more often, and with more force, increasing the pressure inside.", "start": 312.92, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "All three of these laws can be combined into one main equation, known simply as the ideal gas law, which also takes into account the amount of the gas:", "start": 318.36, "duration": 7.36}, {"text": "Pressure times volume is equal to the number\nof moles in the gas, x R x the temperature.", "start": 325.72, "duration": 4.82}, {"text": "Also known as P V equals n R T.", "start": 330.54, "duration": 2.28}, {"text": "The n stands for the number of moles of the gas.", "start": 332.82, "duration": 2.14}, {"text": "A mole is just a unit that\u2019s used to measure the amount of a substance -- in this case, a gas, in terms of the number of molecules.", "start": 334.96, "duration": 6.24}, {"text": "If you have one mole of a gas, it means that you have 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of the stuff.", "start": 341.2, "duration": 5.54}, {"text": "R, meanwhile, is what\u2019s called the universal gas constant.", "start": 346.74, "duration": 3.02}, {"text": "It\u2019s a number that connects the pressure and volume of an ideal gas to the number of moles of the gas and its temperature.", "start": 349.76, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "And for every ideal gas -- as long as your units are consistent -- R will be exactly the same number.", "start": 354.98, "duration": 4.9}, {"text": "The ideal gas law includes the three basic laws we just talked about:", "start": 359.88, "duration": 3.64}, {"text": "how pressure changes with volume, how temperature changes with volume, and how pressure changes with temperature.", "start": 363.52, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "But instead of talking about each of those relationships individually, it lets you relate all four properties of a gas -- including how much gas you have.", "start": 368.72, "duration": 7.2}, {"text": "To see all of this in action, let\u2019s consider how the ideal gas law relates to your commute.", "start": 375.92, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "Let\u2019s say that as part of your daily routine, you drive to school once in the morning, and once in the afternoon.", "start": 380.7, "duration": 5.48}, {"text": "It\u2019s pretty chilly in your car as you drive in the morning -- about 285 Kelvin -- and you don\u2019t bother to turn on the heat.", "start": 386.18, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "By the time the afternoon comes along, it\u2019s much warmer in your car -- about 300 Kelvin -- but you don\u2019t turn on the air conditioning.", "start": 392.06, "duration": 6.3}, {"text": "What we want to know is, how many fewer moles of air are there in your car in the afternoon?", "start": 398.36, "duration": 3.7}, {"text": "Your car isn\u2019t airtight, so molecules of air are free to move in and out.", "start": 402.06, "duration": 3.22}, {"text": "We\u2019ll say that the volume of the inside of your car, where you sit, is about 5 meters cubed.", "start": 405.28, "duration": 4.34}, {"text": "And that volume isn\u2019t going to change much.", "start": 409.62, "duration": 2.02}, {"text": "The pressure inside your car is going to be equal to the outside air pressure, which we\u2019ll take to be the standard atmospheric pressure, or 101,325 Pascals.", "start": 411.64, "duration": 8.94}, {"text": "So, how many moles of air were inside your car as you drove to class in the morning?", "start": 420.58, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "Well, according to the ideal gas law, the amount of gas in moles is equal to pressure x volume divided by temperature x the universal gas constant.", "start": 424.02, "duration": 8.12}, {"text": "And 101,325 Pascals x 5 meters cubed, divided by the universal gas constant x 285 Kelvin, is about 214 moles.", "start": 432.14, "duration": 11.02}, {"text": "So there were roughly 214 moles of air in your car when you drove to class in the morning.", "start": 443.16, "duration": 4.44}, {"text": "Now, how many moles of air were inside your car when you drove home in the afternoon, when it was about 15 Kelvin warmer than in the morning?", "start": 447.6, "duration": 7.32}, {"text": "We do the same calculation, just this time with temperature equal to 300 Kelvin,", "start": 454.92, "duration": 3.98}, {"text": "and find that there were only about 203 moles of air inside your car in the afternoon.", "start": 458.9, "duration": 4.68}, {"text": "That\u2019s a difference of 11 moles!", "start": 463.58, "duration": 1.58}, {"text": "So there\u2019s about 5.2% less air in your car than there was in the morning, just because it got a little warmer outside.", "start": 465.16, "duration": 5.4}, {"text": "Today, you learned about temperature.", "start": 470.56, "duration": 1.66}, {"text": "We talked about thermal expansion, including linear and volume expansion.", "start": 472.22, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "And we went over the ideal gas law, and how to use it to find the number of moles of air in your car.", "start": 475.6,
