it\u2019s time to reintroduce our old friend,\nthe capacitor!", "start": 366.35, "duration": 2.87}, {"text": "In a DC circuit, a capacitor is useful for storing charge temporarily, then releasing it again later on.", "start": 369.22, "duration": 5.86}, {"text": "But so far we\u2019ve been dealing with circuits that have a constant flow of charge, or those that have reached steady state.",

earlier lessons, you know that the amount of charge stored in a capacitor is equal to the voltage across the capacitor times its capacitance.", "start": 385.32, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "And you

three capacitors\nconnected in parallel with a single battery.", "start": 413.32, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "Current will flow into the capacitors, and will stop when each capacitor holds the maximum amount of charge.", "start": 418.1, "duration": 4.86}, {"text": "So, how can you describe the equivalent capacitance\nof a circuit like this?", "start": 422.96, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "Easy: the total amount of charge is the sum\nof the charges held by each individual capacitor.", "start": 426.42, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "And you know that the charge held by each capacitor is equal to the capacitance times the voltage across each one.", "start": 431.14, "duration": 5.78}, {"text": "And since every point of a conductor has the same potential, and all the conductors are connected, all devices connected in parallel will have the same voltage.", "start": 436.92, "duration": 7.86}, {"text": "So, you can simplify the charge equation to say that the equivalent capacitance of the circuit is equal to the sum of all the individual capacitances.", "start": 444.78, "duration": 7.5}, {"text": "Note that this is the not the same as the\nparallel equation for resistors!",

series, which will have a lower overall capacitance.", "start": 457.52, "duration": 5.94}, {"text": "For example, if you have a circuit with three capacitors connected in series with a single battery, then the current still stops flowing when the total voltage across the capacitors equals that of the battery.", "start": 463.46, "duration": 11.06}, {"text": "The charge contained by each capacitor is the same, because current can\u2019t flow through the capacitors, only on either side of them.", "start": 474.52, "duration": 6.95}, {"text": "So if one plate of the first capacitor has a positive charge, then the other plate in that first capacitor has an equal and opposite negative charge.", "start": 481.48, "duration": 7.4}, {"text": "This leads the plate of the next capacitor\nto have an equal and opposite positive charge,", "start": 488.88, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "since the amount of charge in the plates, and\nthe wire that connects them, hasn\u2019t changed.", "start": 493.08, "duration": 4.22}, {"text": "But the nearby charged plate redistributes\nthe charge to compensate.", "start": 497.3, "duration": 3.4}, {"text": "This effect carries all the way through, until the last plate of the third capacitor has a negative charge equal and opposite to the first capacitor\u2019s positive plate.", "start": 500.7, "duration": 7.82}, {"text": "So you can picture the entire set of capacitors\nas one big equivalent capacitor.", "start": 508.52, "duration": 4.959}, {"text": "For devices in series, the voltage drops across each element equal the voltage provided by the battery.", "start": 513.48, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "So to find the equivalent capacitance in this case, just substitute in the charge equation (voltage-times-capacitance) for each voltage across the capacitors.", "start": 518.52, "duration": 8.84}, {"text": "The charge contained by each capacitor is still the same, since the charge on each positive and negative plate is the same for each capacitor.", "start": 527.36, "duration": 7.08}, {"text": "Therefore, you can factor out charge, and you\u2019re left with the equation for equivalent capacitance of capacitors connected in series.", "start": 534.44, "duration": 5.82}, {"text": "So for series capacitors, the combined capacitance\nis less than the weakest individual capacitor.", "start": 540.26, "duration": 5.54}, {"text": "And
