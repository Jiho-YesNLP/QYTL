"start": 214.04, "duration": 1.5}, {"text": "so the whole reason that drives it", "start": 215.54, "duration": 1.77}, {"text": "is having a different concentration\nin the two half cells.", "start": 217.31, "duration": 3.01}, {"text": "And if over here, the zinc concentration's", "start": 220.32, "duration": 2.06}, {"text": "gonna go up over time.", "start": 222.38, "duration": 1.22}, {"text": "Well, then initially it's\ngotta start off lower", "start": 223.6, "duration": 3.57}, {"text": "in concentration than the\ncathode and the cathode,", "start": 227.17, "duration": 2.6}, {"text": "if its concentration's\ngoing down over time,", "start": 229.77, "duration": 2.23}, {"text": "well then it's gotta start\noff higher instead, as well.", "start": 232.0, "duration": 4.94}, {"text": "And so if we take a look\nhere, what this ultimately", "start": 236.94, "duration": 2.18}, {"text": "is gonna look like,\nwe're gonna have E cell.", "start": 239.12, "duration": 2.2}, {"text": "That's again, standard\ncell potential is zero", "start": 243.0, "duration": 1.82}, {"text": "but it's gonna equal\nnegative R T over N F L N Q.", "start": 244.82, "duration": 5.0}, {"text": "And what I really wanna\ndo is break up the Q here.", "start": 250.68, "duration": 2.47}, {"text": "So in this case, it's the\nzinc two plus on the top", "start": 253.15, "duration": 3.5}, {"text": "and on the bottom, if we wrote\nthe overall balance reactor,", "start": 256.65, "duration": 2.44}, {"text": "it would all cancel out.", "start": 259.09, "duration": 0.833}, {"text": "So we only look, you know,", "start": 259.923, "duration": 0.857}, {"text": "and focus back on these half cells", "start": 260.78, "duration": 1.29}, {"text": "and in which case is\nzinc two plus a product?", "start": 262.07, "duration": 3.03}, {"text": "Well that's in the anode side.", "start": 265.1, "duration": 2.07}, {"text": "And so here, we're gonna\nput the zinc two plus,", "start": 267.17, "duration": 2.683}, {"text": "concentration of the anode up top.", "start": 271.17, "duration": 3.4}, {"text": "So, and then where is\nzinc two plus a reactant?", "start": 274.57, "duration": 2.47}, {"text": "Well, that's in the cathode reaction,", "start": 277.04, "duration": 1.73}, {"text": "the reduction half reaction, I should say.", "start": 278.77, "duration": 1.87}, {"text": "So, and in this case that for,", "start": 280.64, "duration": 1.51}, {"text": "that's gonna go on the bottom here.", "start": 282.15, "duration": 1.75}, {"text": "And so Q, the reaction quotient here,", "start": 295.66,

"which one goes on top?", "start": 299.96, "duration": 1.741}, {"text": "Which one goes on bottom?", "start": 301.701, "duration": 0.987}, {"text": "Well, formally here, that's how it works.", "start": 302.688, "duration": 0.833}, {"text": "It's anode over cathode in this example.", "start": 303.521, "duration": 2.529}, {"text": "So, however we also could take\ninto account one other thing", "start": 306.05, "duration": 3.97}, {"text": "and just kind of make a\nmathematical deduction here.", "start": 310.02, "duration": 2.59}, {"text": "This has to come out to be spontaneous.", "start": 312.61, "duration": 2.99}, {"text": "So, we said that concentration\ncells function as batteries,", "start": 315.6, "duration": 2.41}, {"text": "they're galvanic cells, E\ncell has to come out positive.", "start": 318.01, "duration": 2.81}, {"text": "And so the question is, instead\nof identifying, you know,", "start": 320.82, "duration": 2.4}, {"text": "top is anode here and bottom is cathode,", "start": 323.22, "duration": 2.84}, {"text": "what often gets done is,", "start": 326.06, "duration": 1.17}, {"text": "is writing it in terms of low and high.", "start": 327.23, "duration": 3.43}, {"text": "And so obviously we've\nidentified it a certain way", "start": 330.66, "duration": 1.95}, {"text": "and we can put low on the top", "start": 332.61, "duration": 2.81}, {"text": "and high on the bottom.", "start": 338.05, "duration": 1.67}, {"text": "If you do it backwards", "start": 339.72, "duration": 2.14}, {"text": "then you're gonna get a negative E cell", "start": 341.86, "duration": 1.66}, {"text": "and you'll get exactly the\nsame value, just negative.", "start": 343.52, "duration": 2.57}, {"text": "And so if you ever are\ndoing an E cell calculation", "start": 346.09, "duration": 2.16}, {"text": "for a concentration cell,\nand it comes out negative,", "start": 348.25, "duration": 2.9}, {"text": "notice you probably swapped these two", "start": 351.15, "duration": 2.05}, {"text": "and have it exactly backwards.", "start": 353.2, "duration": 2.75}, {"text": "So, but if you do the low\nconcentration over the high", "start": 355.95, "duration": 3.02},
