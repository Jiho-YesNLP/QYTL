the H+?", "start": 290.56, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "Well, that would be the HCl.", "start": 294.4, "duration": 1.453}, {"text": "So they define him as the acid.", "start": 297.58, "duration":

310.85, "duration": 1.22}, {"text": "And so, again, this is happening in water.", "start": 312.07, "duration": 2.657}, {"text": "And so it's satisfying\nArrhenius's definition", "start": 314.727,
