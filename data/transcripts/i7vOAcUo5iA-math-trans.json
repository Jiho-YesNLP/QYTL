We'll get to a lot of,", "start": 830.64, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "a lot of interesting things. So let's get into the math next.", "start": 835.92, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "So we can't talk about proportions without talking about ratios. And ratio is another", "start": 846.16, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "word for a fraction. So this two out of four, I can write that as, well, two out of four,", "start": 851.04, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "but I could say two fourths. I can call it a fraction, but it's also a ratio.", "start": 857.6, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "And then a proportion is two equal ratios. So if I know that these are equal, then there's other", "start": 862.24, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "things I can do with this. And one of the things that works and becomes very useful is cross", "start": 868.88, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "multiply. So if these two are equal ratios, then I can cross multiply, multiply the diagonals.", "start": 874.16, "duration": 9.52}, {"text": "I can do two times 10 equals four times five. And that's another way to write this. So then I can", "start": 883.68, "duration": 9.84}, {"text": "get it out of the proportion mode and I can use this to double check or I can solve for things.", "start": 893.52, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "So two times 10, we see 20 equals 20 and then that's true. So, you know, we confirm that that", "start": 900.48, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "works. We can always do this. If these were other numbers, I can check to see if this really is true", "start": 906.96, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "cross multiplying, because if that doesn't work, then that wouldn't be true. And I can also use it", "start": 911.84, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "if one of these numbers is unknown. So if I have three out of six equals X out of four. Now there's", "start": 918.16, "duration": 7.44}, {"text": "other ways to solve this, but this is the go-to way because it works every time. So when I do my", "start": 926.16, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "when I do my cross multiplying, then I can do this three times four is 12 equals six X. So there we", "start": 931.44, "duration": 13.04}, {"text": "go. Three times four is 12 and then six times X is six X. And then I know that the next step I'm", "start": 944.48, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "going to do is going to be dividing by six. So then I get that X equals two. Now in doing that,", "start": 951.12, "duration": 11.12}, {"text": "we can jump ahead and say, okay, let's I know that when I multiply this diagonal, I can picture this", "start": 962.8, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "step. It's going to be six X. So the next thing I'm doing is dividing by six. So a lot of times we", "start": 970.08, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "just put this in one step. So I multiply the diagonal that I can divide by the other number", "start": 975.6, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "because I know that the next step and then my answer is X. So we can really make use of this", "start": 981.76, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "in writing code. I can see the proportion and I can then just put this all in one step to solve", "start": 988.16, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "for X. And again, that's it's the go-to way it works every time. So I can write code to then prompt", "start": 994.72, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "for these numbers, cross multiply and then solve for X. One of the ways this is also useful is", "start": 1001.84, "duration": 7.04}, {"text": "some of the other applications. If I have, let's say I'm converting something like miles to", "start": 1008.88, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "kilometers. So if I have one mile is about 1.6 kilometers, then I can set this up. This is the", "start": 1016.0, "duration": 13.44}, {"text": "ratio that I know. So as long as I have miles and then kilometers, then if I know one, I can figure", "start": 1029.44, "duration": 10.24}, {"text": "out the other. This unknown can be either place. So if I have two miles, then how many kilometers", "start": 1039.68, "duration": 8.08}, {"text": "is that? You see, we can make use of this. I know that I'm cross multiplying two times 1.6 divided", "start": 1047.76, "duration": 7.76}, {"text": "by one. And then, so there we go. So X would be 3.2. And again, multiplying the diagonal that I can,", "start": 1055.52, "duration": 10.88}, {"text": "two times 1.6 dividing by the other number, which in this case, it's convenient that it's one.", "start": 1066.4, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "So then I can solve. So this is what we're going to use. And we're going to take a look at", "start": 1071.6, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "how to put this into code. And so prompt for these four numbers or three of them,", "start": 1076.16, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "and then figure out the fourth one. So let's take a look at how that'll happen. So let's take a look", "start": 1082.88, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "at the code. So we're going to see here how much easier it is to write some code to solve some of", "start": 1088.64, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "our problems. And just like proportions, we have that cross multiplying that we know works every", "start": 1096.32, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "time. So I'm going to put just a display here to remind us that we're setting up the proportion.", "start": 1101.84, "duration": 7.76}, {"text": "And here's what it looks like. N1, D1 equals N2 over D2. So N for numerator, D for denominator.", "start": 1109.6, "duration": 7.44}, {"text": "And if I have a proportion, I would know one of the ratios.

And I'll look at the addition.", "start": 2269.84, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "Like I said, like order of operations in reverse, the addition or subtraction is going to be the", "start": 2274.64, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "easiest to do first.

And now I get to my second step, divide by 4, divide by 4, divide by 4,", "start": 2288.0, "duration": 12.32}, {"text": "divide by 4, then I get X equals 4. So we have our two-step equation. And in all this, some of these", "start": 2300.32, "duration": 10.32}, {"text": "are, you're going to get quick enough at this that it's not even worth trying to write code", "start": 2310.64, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "or anything to solve this.

So let's take a look at the code. So it's a lot easier to", "start": 2337.28, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "solve for X in Python because we can just import the Sympy library here. And that's the symbolic", "start": 2344.56, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "math library. You don't have to install anything. You can just import it.", "start": 2352.24, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "Google Colab works nicely behind the scenes like that.

All right. So let's go a little", "start": 2530.88, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "bit deeper, looking at different ways we can solve for X here, using Python code. And here is the", "start": 2535.36, "duration": 8.64}, {"text": "code that we were talking about before. So we import Sympy, so we can use our symbols,", "start": 2544.56, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "and then we're still from Sympy, import symbols, and some Sympy.solvers. And here I'm just going", "start": 2550.32, "duration": 7.36}, {"text": "to define that symbol X. And this is the simplest thing. We can have all of this code, and I can", "start": 2557.68, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "just put my equation right here. Here's my equation. And then I can solve that equation,", "start": 2565.28, "duration": 7.92}, {"text": "and I'm solving for X. Notice I don't even really need a print statement, as long as this solve", "start": 2573.2, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "function is the last thing there. And then when we run it, we see it will give this negative 1", "start": 2577.92, "duration": 9.2}, {"text": "half. And notice the brackets around it, because it's a finite set. Nice. Solve. Pretty easy.", "start": 2587.12, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "And if I have something that solves for even, you know, something more complex, like 2X squared", "start": 2595.68, "duration": 8.72}, {"text": "plus 1. Now this is setting this equal to zero. So 2X squared plus 1 actually won't have a real", "start": 2604.4, "duration": 11.12}, {"text": "solution. We can actually take a look at that. And you see the negative square root of I,", "start": 2615.52, "duration": 8.0}, {"text": "and that is I, the imaginary number. So it will give us this. There's other ways to make that", "start": 2623.52, "duration": 8.64}, {"text": "square root display in a better way, but we'll get to that later. And there we go. But we see,", "start": 2632.16, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "you know, it gives us two solutions as this finite set of these two. And if I were to make it,", "start": 2638.16, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "you know, minus 1, or I can even make it minus, you know, 4, we'll have two real solutions there.", "start": 2645.68, "duration": 9.28}, {"text": "But there's still going to be square root solutions.

It'll solve", "start": 2659.36, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "pretty much anything you can type in there. All right. But let's start making this a little bit", "start": 2665.92, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "fancier. What if we prompt for input? So let's say I want this to be, you know, somewhere else, and", "start": 2673.6, "duration": 8.48}, {"text": "rather than somebody going in and finding that correct line and putting the code there,", "start": 2682.64, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "we can just prompt for the input here. And notice the function is input, and then it's going to", "start": 2687.36, "duration": 10.32}, {"text": "display this. Enter equation. And I even have it as zero equals to remind the person that it must be", "start": 2697.68, "duration": 8.16}, {"text": "equal to zero. You could add another print statement saying make sure x is the variable,", "start": 2705.84, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "you know, if that's what you'd like. And this input does come in as a string. But the fact that we", "start": 2710.64, "duration": 9.28}, {"text": "are using these symbols, it will be able to interpret that. And here then we're solving", "start": 2719.92, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "and just putting that into a print statement. There we go. So we have this prompts you enter", "start": 2728.56, "duration": 7.84}, {"text": "the equation. And maybe I just make it three x minus six. How about that? There we go. Something", "start": 2736.4, "duration": 15.04}, {"text": "good. One solution. Three x minus six, because if x is two, then that works. Okay, that's great.", "start": 2751.44, "duration": 9.6}, {"text": "But again, if, you know, I have multiple solutions, or maybe if I just don't want it to look like this,", "start": 2761.04, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "maybe I want it to be a little bit fancier. So, again, this solve stores this as a finite set,", "start": 2768.0, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "so we can do more. All right, we're going to import all the rest of these. Now, here,", "start": 2774.64, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "knowing that it's a finite set, I'm going to store that answer as this variable called solution.", "start": 2780.72, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "And then this particular equation, I know this has one solution, so I'm just going to have it", "start": 2788.0, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "display solution index zero. And that's going to be the first solution, which in this case is going", "start": 2794.16, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "to be the only solution. So when we run it, there we go. And again, this is pretty useful if I want", "start": 2800.24, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "it a little bit nicer output, just like having that nice user interface, you know,", "start": 2808.64, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "having it display zero equals and then waiting for the prompt. So, you know, some other ways we can", "start": 2814.16, "duration": 7.84}, {"text": "do this. And, you know, here's saving this. Okay, that's great. Now, what if I have multiple answers?", "start": 2822.0, "duration": 9.2}, {"text": "And what if I don't know how many answers I'll have? So I'm going to put this here,", "start": 2833.04, "duration": 7.2}, {"text": "so if I enter the solution, now, maybe I'll just put the first one here. We'll get we'll get to", "start": 2840.24, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "this one next soon enough. So I'll just take the same solution that I know has one solution.", "start": 2846.4, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "And just like we were doing before, I'm going to solve it and store that as a solution. Now,", "start": 2853.84, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "notice my loop here and Python has this great", "start": 2860.32, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "method of iterating through everything in that list. So for S in solution, so there we go, every", "start": 2863.84, "duration": 12.32}, {"text": "item in that solution set, whether it be one, whether it be however many,", "start": 2876.72, "duration": 4.4}, {"text": "it'll iterate through that. So S is that solution. And then it'll go through. It'll be that solution.", "start": 2882.16, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "And each time, I'm just going to print x equals, and then I'm going to print out S. So, you know,", "start": 2887.92, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "we make use of the Python shortcuts. There we go. So 2x minus 4, the solution is 2. And we went", "start": 2894.24, "duration": 8.96}, {"text": "through and did this. So what if I have something like something that has multiple solutions? So", "start": 2903.2, "duration": 8.56}, {"text": "what if I have something like something that has multiple solutions? And so I'd also supposing I", "start": 2911.76, "duration": 11.12}, {"text": "want to prompt for this. All right. So what if I just plug in something like this? Now, this,", "start": 2922.88, "duration": 9.12}, {"text": "I know is going to have three solutions, because the three possibilities that would make that zero.", "start": 2933.36, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "So let's see what this does. Again, loops through, and it will output all three solutions very nicely.", "start": 2938.64, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "So we see we're building some of these things behind the scenes that will output one or multiple", "start": 2947.68, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "solutions and output it in a nice way. So we see, you know, if you're going to copy some code that", "start": 2954.48, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "you're going to use, this is the one to do it. Because, you know, you could even like, you know,", "start": 2962.0, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "you take out this, this was my demonstration. But there we go. And you really don't even need these.", "start": 2967.84, "duration": 10.4}, {"text": "So this could be your code. And that will work for anything, because it's going to prompt anybody,", "start": 2978.24, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "you or you or anybody else using this to enter the enter the equation. So there we go. You see,", "start": 2985.84, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "we're building some tools here that we can use to solve. All right. What other ways can we do this?", "start": 2990.64, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "Now, some interesting things. We're also this time, we're going to call it VAR for variables,", "start": 2997.6, "duration": 7.04}, {"text": "and we're going to use x, y, but we'll come back to the y. And we have this one first. You can,", "start": 3004.64, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "because you can use this for multiple equations, but I just call this one first. So there you go,", "start": 3012.24, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "two x plus 10. All right. Now, we know that this is set equal to zero. That's kind of the", "start": 3016.8, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "the go-to way of doing this. But then this simpy syntax, we're actually going to spell it out and", "start": 3022.08, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "define it. EQ first, comma zero, saying that this is set equal to zero. Because then I can solve", "start": 3029.68, "duration": 9.6}, {"text": "for x. That's great. And this solution I just called sol.", "start": 3040.8, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "And since I have this one, I know that the solution is, you know, there's only one. So I", "start": 3044.8, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "just put salt. You know, that's my finite set. And I want the index zero. So this is it. And", "start": 3051.76, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "actually, these are factored results, but this is actually going to give me a nice actual answer", "start": 3058.4, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "because I can get that answer. X is negative five. All right. Now, here's where y comes in.", "start": 3064.24, "duration": 7.44}, {"text": "Now, I have to have y there. If I define y as a variable. Now, down here, I can say, supposing", "start": 3071.68, "duration": 10.4}, {"text": "this is equal to y. And you see that works. So spelling it out here that it's equal to y.", "start": 3083.04, "duration": 9.28}, {"text": "But now I now I'll solve for x. So that's kind of interesting. And then when we do this, you see,", "start": 3092.32, "duration": 9.36}, {"text": "Python could actually do some of this factoring for you. You know, rearranging an equation", "start": 3102.64, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "algebraically. So now it's solved. Why over two minus five. Pretty cool. So we can do something", "start": 3108.32, "duration": 10.4}, {"text": "like that. We can rearrange things. And then if I have this, you know, I could I could change it", "start": 3118.72, "duration": 10.0}, {"text": "around a little bit or whatever. But some different things you can do. The default is make this equal", "start": 3128.72, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "to zero. Make this equal to zero. But this gives you this other flexibility. You can call it equal", "start": 3134.72, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "to y. And then you can do some other things you can solve for it. So pretty cool. As you do this,", "start": 3140.72, "duration": 9.76}, {"text": "as you incorporate this into, you know, some of the notebooks that you're going to create, tinker", "start": 3150.48, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "around with this and, you know, try some different things. You know, that's the idea. You go through", "start": 3155.68, "duration": 4.4}, {"text": "some different some different formulas or different equations in a textbook and say, hey, can I", "start": 3160.08, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "try this? Like, we could take a look at this and say, all right, let's see, solve for y. Now,", "start": 3166.96, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "what about if I have two x, then, then if I want to solve it for and you can even include y in here.", "start": 3172.64, "duration": 12.0}, {"text": "So there we go. And if that's included in y, then I still might then go back down here and say that", "start": 3184.64, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "this is equal to zero, because that's kind of the default way for that to go. And I, I can still go", "start": 3193.04, "duration": 8.72}, {"text": "back and solve for x, and it should end up being very similar. Because, you know, if I want to", "start": 3201.76, "duration": 8.64}, {"text": "do something very similar, because whether that was, you know, without this minus y saying it,", "start": 3210.4, "duration": 9.68}, {"text": "it's equal to y or with this minus y saying it's equal to zero, see algebraically very similar.", "start": 3220.08, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "And, you know, we could even just to show you, we can even say this to x minus y. And we can run", "start": 3226.72, "duration": 11.36}, {"text": "this. There we go, x is y over two, all kinds of different things you can do. If you need to", "start": 3238.08, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "rearrange this, you can put that in this setup here. And then, you know, what is, what is this", "start": 3244.24, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "set equal to now? And what am I solving for here? And in this case, it pretty much will be index", "start": 3251.76, "duration": 9.2}, {"text": "zero for that solution set each time. So these are some cool things you can get the code to do all", "start": 3260.96, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "the factoring for you. Well, here's some other factoring. Supposing I have something like this,", "start": 3267.04, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "you know, we can divide out common factors. Now, you might see this, two x, two times x,", "start": 3272.64, "duration": 8.48}, {"text": "ten times y, plus four. Now, supposing this is another thing in SymPy, I can just factor it.", "start": 3282.16, "duration": 9.28}, {"text": "You know, I'm not saying that's equal to zero or anything. I just want to take a look at this.", "start": 3291.44, "duration": 4.32}, {"text": "I don't want to factor it. Look at that. And SymPy also does the nice display on the output, too.", "start": 3295.76, "duration": 7.44}, {"text": "So you see, there was a common factor of two. And that worked. Now, supposing I had this,", "start": 3304.32, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "and let's say this is three, which then doesn't factor at all. So when I run it,", "start": 3311.92, "duration": 7.04}, {"text": "you know, it will just output that because it's not factorable. All right. Now, what's really", "start": 3318.96, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "interesting is if I have something else, like x squared, and let's say x squared minus four. Now,", "start": 3325.76, "duration": 18.0}, {"text": "you may or may not be familiar with that factoring, but I can factor something like that, too.", "start": 3343.76, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "I look at that. It'll factor that out. That's the correct factoring of that, x minus two, x plus two.", "start": 3348.48, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "So it will do a lot of really interesting factoring for you. So pretty good. Here's another one that", "start": 3354.48, "duration": 7.84}, {"text": "we can, you know, just to show you that we can even take it to the next level.", "start": 3365.36, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "X to the third minus two x squared minus five x plus six. So we have that. And if I factor that,", "start": 3369.36, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "there we go. Look at that. It breaks it down into these factors. So some of these really good things,", "start": 3379.44, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "you know, knowing that you can set your factoring, you know, you know, you can set your", "start": 3387.12, "duration": 10.64}, {"text": "factoring, you can make your own factoring calculator here. All right. So let's take a look", "start": 3397.76, "duration": 8.08}, {"text": "at some of the functions here. So when we have, you know, we have that, we can factor. And then", "start": 3405.84, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "you've been doing some of this practice with these functions. So I want to show you, you know,", "start": 3413.52, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "you know, looking at these and this different input, how we can, how these functions are working that,", "start": 3419.28, "duration": 8.48}, {"text": "you know, remember you were doing the practicing the one step functions,", "start": 3427.76, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "the one step addition, one step multiply. There we go. Now, that first one I want to show you", "start": 3433.68, "duration": 8.56}, {"text": "is because you can't do string to a fraction. This print, this works out just fine. But when", "start": 3442.24, "duration": 9.12}, {"text": "we take this input, now other inputs, if it's actually a number or a decimal, you can do this", "start": 3451.36, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "and you can cast it as a float. So that's a number that could include a decimal. But if you know that", "start": 3458.64, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "it's going to be a fraction, this float won't work because that slash for the fraction doesn't", "start": 3464.72, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "parse nicely.

All right, so I think we're ready to go on to the next unit. So let's talk about fractions and", "start": 4056.0, "duration": 12.88}, {"text": "decimals and how to convert from one to the other. Well, fractions, when I say out of, like this", "start": 4068.88, "duration": 8.16}, {"text": "could be one out of 10. If I say out of, that means divide. So any fraction numerator divided by", "start": 4077.04, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "denominator, you can do that on your calculator and it most likely is going to return at your", "start": 4083.84, "duration": 6.24}, {"text": "decimal.

Calculator, do the division and then, you know, you have your decimal. But", "start": 4096.4, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "what about doing it in the reverse process? So when we look at this, this, I would read each of these", "start": 4103.04, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "one out of 10, I could call it one tenth or 0.1 is what you would get if you did that division.", "start": 4109.92, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "I would still call that one tenth because that first decimal place is the tenths. So that would", "start": 4117.36, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "be one tenth. Or then if I had one out of a hundred, then there we go, two decimal places.", "start": 4123.12, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "So tenths, the second one, the hundredths. So whether I write it like this or like this,", "start": 4130.64, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "I would still call it one hundredth with the th. Then, you know, I just wrote it one more,", "start": 4136.16, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "you know, third decimal is would be thousandths. So, and it would keep on going. So knowing that", "start": 4142.08, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "we have that, you know, tenths, hundredths, thousandths, then that would be our denominator", "start": 4148.96, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "if we want to convert it back the other way. So if I would, if I had something that I would,", "start": 4155.92, "duration": 9.12}, {"text": "you know, 0.234, so something that I wanted to convert, then I would take this as tenths,", "start": 4166.88, "duration": 9.68}, {"text": "hundredths, thousandths.

So 234 out of a", "start": 4187.84, "duration": 8.16}, {"text": "thousand. Or if I had something, you know, like 0.4 one place, that's one tenth. So that would be", "start": 4196.0, "duration": 8.64}, {"text": "four out of ten. And again, I could reduce it or I could leave it as that, you know,", "start": 4204.64, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "that that's converting my decimal right to a fraction. And when we get into the code,", "start": 4210.16, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "we're going to look at how to see here. I'm just looking at this and remembering these tenths,", "start": 4215.76, "duration": 6.24}, {"text": "hundredths, thousandths, et cetera. It could keep going. You could convert any decimal,", "start": 4222.0, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "but I'm looking at these remembering the place values and then saying, oh, that's three. So I'll", "start": 4226.0, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "have ten with one followed by three zeros, you know, one decimal place. So my denominator is", "start": 4231.92, "duration": 7.04}, {"text": "one followed by one zero. And we get into the code, we're going to look at how to do that", "start": 4238.96, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "in a different way rather than just, well, there's a few ways you can like take it as a string and", "start": 4243.12, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "count how many places, or we're going to, you know, one of the lessons we're looking at the", "start": 4247.68, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "logarithm way, probably the string and just counting it, that's probably a little more", "start": 4254.08, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "straightforward. We'll do that one. But there we go. Converting these, you know, how do I get this", "start": 4258.96, "duration": 7.36}, {"text": "and then, you know, how do I reduce it? Okay. So we think we have it all worked out, but what about", "start": 4266.32, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "if I have a repeating decimal? So supposing I have 0.3333 and it keeps repeating.", "start": 4274.16, "duration": 8.08}, {"text": "And mathematically, if I was writing this, you put the line over one of the, the part that repeats.", "start": 4282.24, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "So I really could just keep it as one, but I want to show you three repeats, just put it over the", "start": 4289.92, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "three. So that keeps repeating. Okay. So we were just talking about, you know, how many decimal", "start": 4294.72, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "places and then put it over that. But if it keeps repeating, where do I stop? So let's take a look", "start": 4300.56, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "at a trick how to do this. We want to get to the end of the repeating. So if it only repeats one", "start": 4306.08, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "repeats once, then if I multiply this, let's, let me call this X and actually I'm going to write", "start": 4311.76, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "this down a little bit further. This is, that's going to make sense in a second here. So if I say", "start": 4318.24, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "X is my 0.3333 repeating. All right. So if that's my value, I only need to multiply it by 10 to move", "start": 4324.16, "duration": 12.64}, {"text": "the decimal place once. And then that cancel out. So if I have 10 X, then that's 3.3333, et cetera.", "start": 4336.8, "duration": 11.44}, {"text": "And these keep repeating. Now, the reason I do that is because of all the repeating decimals,", "start": 4348.24, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "everything that repeats now is going to line up. And so if I subtract these,", "start": 4355.76, "duration": 4.4}, {"text": "what can I do on the left? 10 X minus X is nine X equal sign still there. And three point, all this", "start": 4360.16, "duration": 10.08}, {"text": "minus zero point, all this that cancels all this, however many decimal places you want to go,", "start": 4370.24, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "it all cancels and my answer's three. And then one step of algebra, solve for X divide both sides by", "start": 4374.4, "duration": 7.04}, {"text": "nine. So I get X equals three over nine because nine divided by nine is one. So that's one X,", "start": 4381.44, "duration": 9.28}, {"text": "three divided by nine. And I could reduce that as one third if I wanted to. Now keeping it as three", "start": 4390.72, "duration": 7.76}, {"text": "over nine, you know, that's nice, like bonus math insight. If I have a single number that repeats,", "start": 4398.48, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "it's that number over nine. That's the fraction. So if I had four over nine,", "start": 4404.16, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "if I had four, if I had, you know, very similar type, type of question, but if I had", "start": 4409.92, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "something like, uh, if I had zero point four repeating, so then 10 times that would be four", "start": 4418.72, "duration": 7.84}, {"text": "point or four, et cetera. They both keep repeating. Do the same subtraction. 10 minus one is nine X.", "start": 4426.56, "duration": 8.88}, {"text": "And when I subtract these, all the repeating decimals cancel. So four point this minus point", "start": 4435.44, "duration": 6.24}, {"text": "four is exactly four. And when I divide both sides by nine, X equals four over nine.", "start": 4441.68, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "So there we go. And, uh, so one more bonus here. If I had nine repeating,", "start": 4450.88, "duration": 8.72}, {"text": "we could do the same thing. And you would think 0.999. That's not exactly one. And well later on", "start": 4459.6, "duration": 10.72}, {"text": "in calculus, we can look at limits and how 0.9 repeating. If it keeps on going for all practical", "start": 4470.32, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "purposes, that is one. But if we did this, it would be nine's repeating and we divide by nine", "start": 4476.64, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "and you get X equals one. So it kind of works out nicely, but this is, this is how we can do this.", "start": 4482.48, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "You know, notice we're not looking at code here. Now we're just taking this. And, um, if we have", "start": 4489.36, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "something that repeats, then that's what we need to do. We need to find out where it repeats. If I", "start": 4495.36, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "had something that repeated, um, you know, three, two, two places over and over again, uh, let's do", "start": 4501.44, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "that one. And just to give you an idea of a different way, if I have something that repeats,", "start": 4508.24, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "then if I have, uh, so X equals, uh, 0.090909, something like that, and it's the zero nine that", "start": 4515.84, "duration": 13.76}, {"text": "it's the zero nine that repeats. So I need to multiply it by a hundred to line it up. So 100", "start": 4529.6, "duration": 10.16}, {"text": "X because that would move the decimal place twice and that makes it 9.090909, et cetera.", "start": 4539.76, "duration": 11.2}, {"text": "So when I do that now, same method, if I subtract these, that's 99 X equals nine because then that", "start": 4550.96, "duration": 10.24}, {"text": "cancels. So then X equals 99, uh, nine over 99 and fine, perfectly acceptable answer, but we can", "start": 4561.2, "duration": 12.0}, {"text": "reduce this divided by nine. So that's one out of 11. We'll get into reducing fractions and also the", "start": 4573.2, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "code for that too, but you see, this is, this is one way. If you have something that repeats and", "start": 4580.88, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "maybe you're right the way you write the code, it might seem to break it. If, if you don't, uh, if", "start": 4586.8, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "you don't find some way around it, this is the way around it. So we can convert any repeating", "start": 4593.28, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "decimal, but now we're going to, what we're going to do is we're going to get into the code and how", "start": 4598.16, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "to take any decimal. Just here's the decimal input. How can I find a way to count how many spaces that", "start": 4603.44, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "is and reframe that as a fraction so that given the decimal and then turn it into a fraction", "start": 4610.08, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "related to that is percents because remember the first is 10th hundredth. So the first two digits", "start": 4617.44, "duration": 7.68}, {"text": "are the hundredths and that's really what percent means out of a hundred. So percent is all the same", "start": 4625.12, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "thing. And then just, I'm always looking at the first two decimal places. That's my percent.", "start": 4632.08, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "So, you know, very similar, but just the first two decimal places.

You see, so maybe", "start": 5468.32, "duration": 8.0}, {"text": "we'll copy this cell, and paste this down here. Now, maybe I'm going to add text and just put", "start": 5476.32, "duration": 10.0}, {"text": "factor. And down here, then I will paste it. Didn't show up where I wanted to. I can use the", "start": 5486.32, "duration": 12.96}, {"text": "arrow, move it down. So, you know, there we go.

And see, you can put this however you", "start": 5507.76, "duration": 11.12}, {"text": "want. There we go. And then, you know, you can factor things. So we have these. We can go into", "start": 5518.88, "duration": 14.56}, {"text": "the next week.

So you see now you're putting together your resources", "start": 5580.72, "duration": 18.48}, {"text": "here. And we don't need that output right now. Now, we have one more here. Factoring and solving", "start": 5599.2, "duration": 11.2}, {"text": "for a variable. And notice it's when I paste this, I might put it with the other one.

So I'm going to print out this line here which is X and then I'm going to put a", "start": 6373.84, "duration": 8.32}, {"text": "tab Y. So that's defining my columns here X and Y.

the loop just went through and looped so these are the ways that we can", "start": 6578.56, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "illustrate a function in code and you know what we can do with these functions you know is", "start": 6586.16, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "almost limitless you know you can have a function do anything and you can name it anything more", "start": 6594.88, "duration": 4.24},

whether I actually just call it y equals that", "start": 6604.32, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "that still works as a function or whether I define it and next we're going to look at graphing functions", "start": 6610.88, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "so now when we talk about graphing functions we'll use this equation y equals two x plus three", "start": 6621.12, "duration": 6.24},

at all up to three plot the point now I don't also need to", "start": 6690.56, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "write this but I'll show you so then that would be the point zero three so x y and then one five", "start": 6697.36, "duration": 7.92}, {"text": "so I would go over one up five plot the point and then that's one five two seven plot the point", "start": 6705.28, "duration": 9.2}, {"text":

years how many people were afflicted with the flu and supposing", "start": 9944.24, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "I want that exact number so I can go back to this and then x is five so one of the

also have your setup to solve an equation so you know you have this and remember", "start": 10066.08, "duration": 11.84}, {"text": "this was the whole setup to solve an equation and print the solution

10083.84, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "this case i'll put it here h 75 minus 50 x and remember it's remember the python 50 times x", "start": 10089.44, "duration": 13.2}, {"text": "so that's by default set equal to zero so when we run it so the answer is 35 over two interesting", "start": 10102.64, "duration": 12.08}, {"text": "that gave us a fraction but there you go so that's 17.5 so 17.5 years

9.52}, {"text": "going to be that nobody has the flu or something like that but we can actually take a look at this", "start": 10133.84, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "and we can change the x maximum to 18 and then we can see this trend so we look at that you see then", "start": 10140.24, "duration": 12.0}, {"text": "according to this trend you know time zero and that would be you know at 17.5 years

here's another one where they even give you the partial line based on the graph they have", "start": 10208.56, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "all right so this is showing profit so this figure one is showing profit in thousands of a company", "start": 10218.16, "duration": 7.2}, {"text": "in a given year x and they also do x represents years since 1980 so there we go if x if time", "start":

given these we want to find the linear function all right so let's take a look at if i", "start": 10248.72, "duration": 8.72}, {"text": "want to look at these i just want to find two nice points that i feel confident that i'm not just", "start": 10257.44, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "estimating the points so i like this first one at year five it was 10 000 now it it's interesting", "start": 10263.76, "duration": 10.72}, {"text": "because it says y in thousands so therefore 10 000 would be 10 million you see so if y is in", "start": 10274.48, "duration": 13.04}, {"text": "thousands then 10 000 would be 10 million in which case they could have just said it was in millions", "start": 10287.52, "duration": 8.32}, {"text": "but that's okay and then we have so five i'm going to shift it to millions and just make the", "start": 10295.84, "duration": 9.84}, {"text": "y value 10 so five ten and then let's find another nice point i like this 25 four so we can go back", "start": 10305.68,

years then we're talking 10 million and then at 25 years", "start": 10325.52, "duration": 11.76}, {"text": "then we were talking two four", "start": 10339.76, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "four",

see this graph since i made them 10 i really could now we could we could take", "start": 10363.28, "duration": 10.4}, {"text": "a look at this and say oh yeah 12 is probably fine as far as a y maximum and we could continue", "start": 10373.68, "duration": 8.16}, {"text": "this to 30 or you know we can take it further so when i go to graph it zero x maximum 18 is not", "start": 10381.84, "duration": 12.16}, {"text": "going to be enough maybe i'll just make it a nice round 50 y minimum fine y maximum 900 that", "start": 10394.0, "duration": 7.76}, {"text": "would the scale would be so much it would this would just be in the tiny corner of the graph", "start": 10401.76, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "so maybe we'll just call that 15 or something like that all right there we go and for this one", "start": 10407.04, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "we could", "start": 10418.96, "duration": 0.56}, {"text": "just delete this", "start": 10422.56, "duration": 0.88}, {"text": "like the space in there we could just delete this and we have i'm going to print out the correct", "start": 10423.44, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "the equation so when we run it so here's our equation negative point three x plus 11.5", "start": 10428.72, "duration": 10.32}, {"text": "and we see this downward trend over time and here's another one where if i wanted to", "start": 10439.04, "duration": 11.6}, {"text": "change these tick marks maybe i could change this to the x ticks", "start": 10451.68, "duration": 9.84}, {"text": "is two enough yeah yeah maybe and then i can change the y ticks is two enough yeah maybe we'll see", "start": 10461.52, "duration": 11.92}, {"text": "and we'll run it so we see we get much many more lines all right and we'll see what happens", "start": 10474.32,

being rectangles more i might change my y ticks to one i think", "start": 10497.92, "duration": 8.56}, {"text": "i just like that better and you know in doing this you can you know change some things and go", "start": 10506.48, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "go there we go so with this then we can really see the trend there's your 11.5 and then we can see", "start": 10512.16, "duration": 10.4}, {"text": "this downward trend down 0.3 so it should go you know over 10 it just went down three to 8.5", "start": 10522.56, "duration": 10.88}, {"text": "here we go and then 38 years later then they would have no profit because that's the trend", "start": 10533.44, "duration": 8.56}, {"text": "that we're saying there we go so whatever this company is this is their profit since 1980", "start":

this is but", "start": 10555.84, "duration": 9.12}, {"text": "you know our fictional company is you know something would have to change but that's where", "start": 10564.96, "duration": 6.48},

straight line unless something changed but we know then in", "start": 10578.56, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "uh normal business normal day-to-day life things do change and that's why our lines aren't always", "start": 10585.84, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "perfectly straight but this gives a often enough of a prediction oh and you see then time and then", "start": 10590.88, "duration": 8.0},

and we can see where it would start and then", "start": 10612.8, "duration": 9.44}, {"text": "profit declining and that's enough years that you know 11.5 million was a lot more money in 1980",

know they were in uh in sad shape all right and we have the y intercept and all that", "start": 10637.2, "duration": 8.0}, {"text": "okay so we see another very very similar we'll do we'll do one more here so consider this scenario", "start": 10645.2, "duration": 7.6}, {"text": "2004 school population was 1700 by 2012 the population had grown to 2500 so all right and", "start": 10652.8, "duration":

so this a is really just the subtraction", "start": 10670.56, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "so 2500 minus 1700 is 800 so it grew that much and then the average per year you see", "start": 10678.96,

in the wrong so there you go time zero 1700", "start": 10743.68, "duration": 15.36}, {"text": "1500 and so in 2012 so time zero and then in 2012 so that's eight years later it was 2500", "start":

2500 but we're going a little bit", "start": 10802.88, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "further so let's make it 3000 and see if that's going to be enough", "start": 10809.44, "duration": 5.52}, {"text":

there we go i'm just going to do", "start": 14248.0, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "a plus b and i'm going to click run and you see two plus one is three and then it said code test", "start": 14254.64,

could hit run or i can hit shift enter which i'll do that time code test passed", "start": 14272.16, "duration": 9.68}, {"text": "so this is just getting you familiar and then each of these imports the test so", "start": 14282.72, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "so you've run that first cell and then you have the test and that's what's going to check your", "start": 14288.64, "duration": 7.68},

work out if they were definitely", "start": 14339.36, "duration": 8.64}, {"text": "defined as integers then i would have to do something else because if i divide the answer", "start": 14348.0,

there we go", "start": 14364.96, "duration": 5.12}, {"text": "so you can and a lot of things that you might work through here if this is your your notebook", "start": 14373.68, "duration": 4.8},

prompt for input and then that could be the different numbers that", "start": 14394.56, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "that you want that way you don't have to worry about changing the code so in this case enter", "start": 14398.8, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "a positive integer it actually could for what we're doing here it could be negative but i", "start": 14404.16, "duration": 4.8}, {"text":

do some math to it", "start": 14414.64, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "all right so i need to do an integer or a float and then the only thing you need to do here is", "start": 14417.84, "duration": 7.76}, {"text": "following that model i have string b and a lot of these have you know some code that something", "start": 14425.6, "duration": 10.24}, {"text": "there that won't break the code but

i feel like you entered one i want to say enter another oh and i copied the wrong one", "start": 14460.4, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "and i want to cast it as a string as i want to cast as an integer so string b okay so if i have", "start": 14466.88, "duration": 16.72}, {"text": "that now so i don't need to tinker with this at all so i might not but if i wanted to change this", "start": 14483.6,

tell me hey", "start": 14591.92, "duration": 8.32}, {"text": "your into your input should be this now my point here is this will not prevent you to go", "start": 14600.88, "duration": 6.8}, {"text":

looks correct or something like that", "start": 14613.36, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "and maybe you're watching this video because that's where you were stuck it should not prevent you", "start":

different i'm not worried about it on to the next step but if you wanted to you say oh", "start": 14628.64, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "okay well maybe i just should have just said this you know you could always go back through and", "start": 14634.72, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "check it and then see there we go and then and then you can make your change so the whole thing", "start": 14641.52,

4 6 and 12 and we can run it again enter an integer", "start": 15339.68, "duration": 7.92}, {"text": "supposing enter like 17 1 and 17 because it's prime so that's what we're doing just showing all",

that's not prime is composite so if i", "start": 15374.8, "duration": 9.36}, {"text": "so if i have you know five is prime because the only way you can multiply to get there is one times", "start":

start at two up to and including the number", "start": 15432.64, "duration": 4.88}, {"text": "again not including the number because this this this time it won't include the number i", "start":

{"text": "and and that's the thing with with reusing code yes we know we're all going to use a lot of copy", "start": 15499.92, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "and paste because that helps you know if

is happen once and that", "start": 15532.72, "duration": 6.0}, {"text": "means the number is composite and it's only prime starts out that variable is prime and it stays", "start": 15538.72,

anything and just take a look at what's", "start": 16527.2, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "going on here how we're dividing that out and then when you run it so if i enter an integer", "start":

equals 25 times two and again that first part is a square factor", "start": 16549.76, "duration": 8.32}, {"text": "so now", "start": 16562.16, "duration": 0.56}, {"text": "there we go the last four

50 as we were talking about before", "start": 16805.84, "duration": 2.88}, {"text": "so and just because this came first that's why it says test passed here and then we see the output", "start":

are especially in a small simple", "start": 17451.2, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "function like this so then you see you know this variable how do how do i pass it to the function", "start": 17457.52,

function so you could do", "start": 18010.08, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "this now what's interesting is you as defining the function here uh you could define it", "start": 18015.76, "duration":

11.36}, {"text": "it's actually kind of funny that just popped up but there we go", "start": 18211.52, "duration": 2.64}, {"text": "so you see the output but because it's in a function we have to

6.72}, {"text": "so four dollars times x which is every time you go then y would be the total cost and then they", "start": 18376.56, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "have a deal oh well if you pay ten dollar membership fee then your admissions three dollars", "start": 18383.12, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "so there you have the the decision like okay well with this membership fee my admissions lower", "start": 18390.32, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "but when would these be the same price you know how many times would i have to go for these to be", "start": 18397.44, "duration": 6.32},

going to get into some other ways to solve this", "start": 18410.48, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "but we're looking at just how this graph plays out here so if i graph that y equals three x plus ten",

plot begin at 10 and then up three over over one and let's just say you know it's something", "start": 18429.04, "duration": 7.92}, {"text": "like this and let's just say that's the line and then we have y equals four x so there's no beginning", "start": 18436.96, "duration": 9.44}, {"text": "it begins at zero but it's a steeper slope you know be at zero steeper slope and then let's just",

be harder to see but we can then always test it oh if i see it looks like", "start": 18490.0, "duration": 4.96}, {"text": "that's where that's where these lines intersect we can plug that in does that work for each one", "start": 18494.96, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "so if x is 10 so it would be three times 10 plus 10 and then y would be 40 so our question is does", "start": 18500.24, "duration": 10.08}, {"text": "that work three times 10 is 30 plus 10 is 40 yes that does work and then it would be the same thing", "start": 18510.32, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "you know four times 10 and y is

we run that interactive plot it's going to take the input from these", "start": 19503.44, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "sliders and then run this function so let's see how that works so a lot of times

the graph now i'd have to move that back now you start seeing it on the graph", "start": 19571.04, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "and these are some cool things you can do with your graph you can add

all the way", "start": 19616.64, "duration": 8.56}, {"text": "all the way so now i'm really zoomed out and it it looks like this might even cross it zero zero", "start": 19625.2, "duration": 7.6},

and keeping", "start": 29357.68, "duration": 9.04}, {"text": "it blue so how do i plot exactly one point so notice this array of x values of which there's", "start": 29366.72, "duration": 8.8},

i have just b with nothing that's going to make it a line", "start": 29387.84, "duration": 7.2}, {"text": "if i actually just had r with nothing that would make it a line but it actually has nowhere to go", "start": 29395.04, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "too so that would be weird but ro makes it a point and we'll see we can plot other things too", "start": 29399.76, "duration": 10.32}, {"text":

29416.96, "duration": 11.04}, {"text": "now we could put the grid lines in but that'll be another story so now change the location", "start": 29429.92, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "so the directions run it then change the location to negative five one", "start": 29438.08, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "one okay so then we just change this to negative five and change this to one", "start": 29441.52,

3.92}, {"text": "so how would i plot several points", "start": 29480.16, "duration": 1.6}, {"text": "well let's take a look all right so a ray is to plot each point you know that's what we've been doing", "start": 29481.76, "duration": 10.48}, {"text": "and we can still define it as an array here i'm just going to define the array here an array of", "start": 29497.36, "duration": 7.44},

still the same and here i can plot x y now i chose x y", "start": 29517.84, "duration": 11.36}, {"text": "because you know x values and y values and i did not use exactly x and y as other variables already", "start": 29529.2, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "so we're okay i mean you really could name these arrays whatever you want", "start": 29535.36, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "but there we go we have what am i plotting the array of x values the array of y values", "start": 29541.68, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "and then here i have red points for each of them now right here i only have one l one number in each", "start": 29545.92, "duration": 11.36}, {"text": "so we can add so that's the assignment for this step add two numbers to each so that also graphs", "start": 29557.28, "duration": 6.72}, {"text": "one one and two five okay so the x value would be one and the y value would be one so there you go", "start": 29564.0, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "so i have point four two and then point one one and the next one two five so x value would be two", "start": 29572.4, "duration": 8.56}, {"text": "y value would be five and there we go all right and changing those arrays now i can plot i still", "start": 29580.96, "duration": 14.0}, {"text": "don't have to change this code plot that array and we see three different points because each of them", "start": 29594.96, "duration":

7.2}, {"text": "ro the o indicates a dot rs you could plot a square and then r with a little carrot symbol", "start": 29662.0, "duration": 7.76}, {"text": "would be a triangle so that if you have

the drawing", "start": 34586.88, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "of this works better than somehow sometimes how it plays out with python but this is the floor", "start": 34592.24, "duration": 5.12},

there we go", "start": 36730.88, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "and we can zoom in a little bit see this curve a little bit better there we go so if a is anything", "start": 36736.48, "duration": 8.56},

three moves it three to the right", "start": 36757.84, "duration": 8.24}, {"text": "and then c also you know moves it up and again we're looking at that point where this starts", "start": 36768.16,

you what you know", "start": 39410.0, "duration": 8.0}, {"text": "what's the cutoff point you can always just put these in you know a nice little if statement", "start": 39418.0, "duration": 6.4},

know this is cooled off i'm gonna get out um", "start": 39533.28, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "so in uh it you know in the united states kind of recently the real estate market", "start": 39543.92,

that that's why it becomes a negative exponent", "start": 50025.28, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "because i want to divide it out to get that early number there all right so if we run this", "start":

all these points but", "start": 52464.82, "duration": 9.92}, {"text": "what if i change this so what i can do is my y minimum and these are the things this is what we", "start": 52474.74, "duration":

this is now where we get to the analysis part what can i", "start": 52491.22, "duration": 8.32}, {"text": "do i can look at this and say all right you know they're all less than six and they're all greater", "start": 52499.54, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "well actually they're all greater than zero so i can just make my y minimum zero and i'm just", "start": 52506.5, "duration": 7.52}, {"text":

four minutes yeah interesting so we can look at this and then one of the other", "start": 52550.42, "duration": 12.32}, {"text": "things that we can do now let's look at another twist on this you can use variables for the column", "start": 52562.74, "duration": 8.88}, {"text": "names so remember earlier we made column names this array so i can have column name zero column", "start": 52571.62,

columns doing that once might save you some typing because", "start": 52589.38, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "then you can reuse that variable here just yeah i don't have to worry about all the quotes every", "start": 52594.5, "duration": 9.04}, {"text": "time now i have my x variable is that column to numpy my y variable that column just like we were", "start": 52603.54, "duration": 10.32},

you that that same scatter plot back to that those original", "start": 52622.34, "duration": 8.08}, {"text": "dimensions are there but you see using that as the column name i can also set the labels for the graph", "start": 52630.42, "duration": 8.88}, {"text": "and again without having to rewrite so now we have index and eruption length", "start": 52639.3, "duration": 8.96}, {"text": "there we go then if i wanted to talk about the eruption time or the erupt the wait time so all", "start": 52650.02, "duration": 11.68}, {"text": "the things that we were doing i can just change this i still want the index but then uh column", "start": 52661.7, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "uh columns one was the eruption length i'll change that to that was the wait time and now i have those", "start": 52668.58, "duration": 9.68}, {"text": "names everything else stays the same and again going to different columns that's why i like", "start": 52678.26, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "giving the

have this range of 40 minutes to you know more than 90 minutes and this is key", "start": 52720.5, "duration": 8.0}, {"text": "like let's say this is in yellowstone let's say you go to visit and you say okay how long should", "start": 52728.5, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "i have to wait it just erupted i want to go do other things when should i come back well should", "start": 52733.94,

waiting there almost an hour but let's let's start looking at other", "start": 52745.78, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "patterns here again the default i keep this index i want to zoom in on some range here", "start": 52751.86, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "so i'll go to that index that x value i'll keep the same minimum but what if i change that maximum", "start": 52758.26, "duration": 7.2},

again doesn't help you but it spreads it out you", "start": 52778.74, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "see now instead of a scatter plot actually i'll keep the scatter plot because that looks nice", "start": 52786.02, "duration": 10.56}, {"text": "but i'll also make it a line graph and i'll make the dots red and the line blue", "start": 52797.22, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "so look at that", "start": 52807.22, "duration": 0.72}, {"text": "and you see that just looks nice and if i don't you know there's my y-axis at zero but if i don't", "start": 52807.94, "duration": 9.76}, {"text": "want that then i can just make my x x minimum you know one that way and comment that that way i", "start": 52817.7, "duration": 10.08}, {"text": "comment that that way i don't even get distracted by that there we go so we take a look at this", "start": 52827.78, "duration": 10.56}, {"text": "now besides seeing the scatter pot that was a mess the line graph actually shows us some", "start": 52839.22,

weight", "start": 52858.66, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "but we get a shorter weight a longer weight a shorter weight you know exception longer weight", "start": 52865.7, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "that happens most of the time so what we can do is we could look at this and say oh well how long", "start": 52872.02, "duration": 9.76}, {"text": "oh well how long was it last time and then therefore i can use that to predict and we get", "start": 52881.78, "duration": 8.4}, {"text": "that from you know we get that from looking at the graph here so yeah really interesting i mean",

to have i don't know like a few minutes um", "start": 52962.34, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "you know if it just erupted and it was an 80 minute wait then you know would it be", "start": 52968.5,

and that's really what we want to get this down to we want to look at", "start": 52983.22, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "these patterns and be able to then predict the next one you know that's really the goal you know", "start": 52987.14, "duration": 10.08}, {"text": "if i go to here and i want to be able to predict and say oh all right at 50 that was a wait time", "start": 52997.22, "duration":

change this to like 55", "start": 53011.06, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "so with the wait time of 50 minutes then the next one wasn't quite 80 and so that's like your range", "start": 53018.66,

could since all the rest is already in there i could", "start": 53771.7, "duration": 9.44}, {"text": "just pick this and say well what about over the course of the year so maybe i make that like one",

that seemed like that would be it i'm not really going to overthink that", "start": 53873.14, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "right now maybe there were some days that were missing but you know maybe that's not the", "start": 53878.9, "duration": 9.6}, {"text": "pattern but you know maybe that sometimes that happens we go and we can uh go through and you", "start": 53888.5, "duration": 9.2},
