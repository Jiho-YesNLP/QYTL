the\ntetrachloroaurate two ion.", "start": 384.33, "duration": 5.0}, {"text": "Okay, so we got one other\nthing to deal with here", "start": 392.46, "duration": 3.85}, {"text": "and that's when you

1.38}, {"text": "we're gonna say tris not tri.", "start": 451.02, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "So you gotta remember that\nthat's for polydetant ligands.", "start": 454.2, "duration": 2.11}, {"text":
