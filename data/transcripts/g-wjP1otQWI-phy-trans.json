this means that for every branch in a parallel connection, the voltage is the same, no matter what the resistance is.", "start": 377.29, "duration": 6.98}, {"text": "So, for a series connection, the current is the same for all resistors, and the voltage drop changes.", "start": 384.27, "duration": 5.72}, {"text": "But in a parallel connection, the voltage is the same for all resistors, and the

voltage and resistance.", "start": 415.42, "duration": 4.97}, {"text": "And since the voltage for each resistor is the same in parallel, you can cancel the voltage term out of the entire equation and we\u2019re left with the equation for parallel equivalent resistance.", "start": 420.4, "duration": 9.02}, {"text": "This shows you that the equivalent resistance for a parallel setup of resistors will actually be smaller than any one of the resistors in the circuit.", "start": 429.42, "duration": 7.66}, {"text": "And this kind of makes sense, if you think\nback to our river analogy!", "start":

not exist.", "start": 440.1, "duration": 8.04}, {"text": "So any additional branch will serve to decrease the total resistance of the system, and increase the amount of current through the entire circuit.", "start": 448.14, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "All right, now that we\u2019ve learned what series and parallel connections are, let\u2019s go back to those circuits we talked about at the

brightly.", "start": 462.92, "duration": 4.44}, {"text": "Now what happens when you add an identical\nlight bulb in a series connection?", "start": 467.36, "duration": 3.68}, {"text": "Since identical light bulbs have identical resistances, you know that the resistance in the circuit would be double.", "start": 471.04, "duration": 5.38}, {"text": "And this corresponds to a current that\u2019s\nhalf of what it would be for a single bulb.", "start": 476.42, "duration": 4.04}, {"text": "And sure enough, once you complete the circuit, you can see that the bulbs are less bright than the original, single-bulb circuit.", "start": 480.46, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "And if you added more bulbs in series, you\u2019d see that the brightness would keep decreasing for each additional bulb.",

resistance.", "start": 491.54, "duration": 8.62}, {"text": "Now you see that each bulb is the same brightness\nas the single-bulb circuit!", "start": 500.16, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "So, why is that?", "start": 503.64, "duration": 1.2}, {"text": "Well, in this setup, the current has an additional \u2013 but identical \u2013 path to go through, so the overall resistance is half of what it was with a single-wire circuit.", "start": 504.84, "duration": 7.86}, {"text": "Since the equivalent resistance is half of what it used to be, and the voltage hasn\u2019t changed, the current increases to double its original value.", "start": 512.7, "duration": 7.14}, {"text": "But since the current must divide equally into each of the different paths, we\u2019re left with two bulbs that have the same
