The story behind this lecture: Clementi & Raimondi were at IBM c.1960. They had access to IBM supercomputers to work out multi-electron functions, but they developed this Z-value modifier method for chemist who could not expect to ever have access to IBM's hardware vault. Basically, they just tweaked the value of Z for every orbital configuration until the outputs most closely matched what their computers said. You can google their names to get their values tables.
