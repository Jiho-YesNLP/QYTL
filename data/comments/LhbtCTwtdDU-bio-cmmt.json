I believe one has to consider rather the wavelength of the emission light not the excitation light. If you take the excitation wavelength that formula tells you to what smaller possible spot you can focus that light to. Vice versa if you have 2 GFP fluorophores emitting at certain wavelength this is what's important not the excitation light. Otherwise we would not observe worse resolution the further red we go with fluorophores.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LhbtCTwtdDU", "cid": "UgwYpME0kVjWK8Fqp4N4AaABAg", "comment": "I think it's funny that the view count decays rapidly from lecture 1 through to 29, and then suddenly there's a spike of interest on lecture 30 followed by another decay.

This causes the NIR to be converted to VIS, which is then picked up by a PMT. Because these non linear effects need a very high energy density, it only occurs in the focal plane, no pinhole required. Also the NIR penetrates tissue very well, so you can image thick slices or even live animals.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "LhbtCTwtdDU", "cid": "UgwEkGqIDKglocsFTvJ4AaABAg.9Iuw2Ig6QZL9Mb2gLEmFRM", "comment": "\u00a0@leothecrafter4808\u00a0 Thank you!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "LhbtCTwtdDU", "cid": "UgwrO4eW5RK3vo_euwx4AaABAg.99o_LhfHZP-9D8dsdsWFbv", "comment": "true", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "LhbtCTwtdDU", "cid": "UgwrO4eW5RK3vo_euwx4AaABAg.99o_LhfHZP-9PenBteqbJ-", "comment": "agree", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
