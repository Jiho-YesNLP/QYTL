Assume you have n ( n \u2265 2, n \u03f5 Z ) jugs each with a unique value v_n ( v \u2265 1 , v \u03f5 Z ), where at least one jug p has a volume v such that v \u03f5 P, where K is the maximum volume of the jugs, and \u2200n, n\u2260p, p\u2224n. Cases with multiple p jugs is trivial, as due to the definition of a prime, there does not exist a greatest common denominator G > 1 that divides all n for obvious reasons. Jugs can be filled up completely, emptied completely, or poured into one another up to the max volume v_n for that jug.   Assume after m states, your jugs have a current state of (x_0, x_1, x_2 ... x_n). Assume there exists a value G for all n jugs. Through proof by induction, we know that the only possible values for all n are linear combinations of x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 K). Since linear combinations of values that share a G will also share that G, and only linear combinations of x can be produced by the given rules, then we know that all volumes y (y_0, y_1, y_2 ... y_n) in state m+1 must also share that G, and as such, all volumes for all n must be a multiple of G. Because m is an arbitrary state, then through induction we have proven that all volumes for all n jugs at any state will have an invariant, that is, that they are a multiple of G.  If we assume one value p is prime, and no other jug is a multiple of p (alternatively, have more than one p, which trivially sets G to 1), then G must be 1. Therefore because the volumes (x_0, x_1, x_2 ... x_n) at state m are arbitrary with the only condition being (\u2200x, G|x, x\u2264K), if G is 1, then you can reach any arbitrary target value 0 \u2264 V \u2264 K.   For the layman, for any arbitrary set of n jugs with unique volumes, if at least one jug is prime in volume (and all the jugs aren't a multiple of that prime in volume), or if there are more than one prime volume jug, there is GAURANTEED to be a way to reach ANY integer volume up to the largest jug just by completely emptying, completely filling, or completely transferring contents of the jugs.   QED \u25a0  What does that actually mean? Well, the solution  to the 3 and 5 gallon jug problem is trivial. But now we can construct a problem that is far less trivial, with a far less trivial answer. The most difficult case would be a situation where all the jugs are prime, and the target volume is another prime.   Therefore I have come up with a problem.   Assume you have 100 jugs with a volume v \u03f5 P such that v_0 is the 100th prime, v_1 is the 101th prime, and so on, up to v_49 being the 149th prime, skipping over the 150th prime, with  v_50 being the 151st prime, v_52 being the 152nd prime, and so on, up to v_99 being the 199th prime. What is the lowest number of iterations m  using the legal moves (completely emptying, completely filling, completely transferring) that renders a result of a volume of the 150th prime?   I doubt this would require a PhD in mathematics to solve, but it would certainly take more than the few minutes it takes to solve the original problem of just 3 gallon and 5 gallon jugs to reach 4 gallons.

This statement \"If m is a common divisor of a and b, then m is a common divisor of any result of the game\" is equivalent with (m|a \u2229 m|b) -> [ (x,y) is a state/result -> ( m|x \u2229 m|y) ]. This statement \"So, any multiple of 1 (smaller or equal than 5, obviously) would be a reachable result for the game.\" is equivalent with (1|a \u2229 1|b) -> [ (1|x \u2229 1|y) -> (x,y) is a state/result ]. Please note the reserve on the direction inside the \"[ ]\". This is actually a flaw in the entire prove. We can not say any linear combination of a and b is a result. In fact Lemma 4.1.3 here (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_chap04.pdf ) only proves that any result is a linear combination but not vice versa. Unless we can prove (x,y) is a state/result <-> ( m|x \u2229 m|y) (note the double direction here), we can not use the prove shown in the class to state that \"any linear combination of a and b is a result\". We can however show that if something is not a linear combination of a and b, then it will not be a result/state. For instance, since 4 is not a liner combination of 33 and 55, it can not be a result. This is using the fact that (m|a \u2229 m|b) -> [ (x,y) is a state/result -> ( m|x \u2229 m|y) ] is equivalent with (m|a \u2229 m|b) -> [ NOT ( m|x \u2229 m|y) -> (x,y) is not a state/result ] (because any conditional statement is equivalent with its contrapositive, which can be verified through Truth Table).
