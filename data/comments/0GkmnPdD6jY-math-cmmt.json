One contains another revolution, if it is of interest to your application to keep track of revolutions.  But it is common that we are only interested in the modular arithmetic of radians, and reducing them after every full revolution.     Again, it depends on application.

It also allows you to track arc length, just by multiplying the angle and the radius, rather than also needing to convert units.   Formulas in Physics such as Power = torque * rotational speed work out elegantly when rotational speed has units of radians/second.  But you end up needing conversion factors when you use degrees per second, or revolutions per second.  For instance, when you take derivatives of sin(x), you end up with a cycle of derivatives that repeats itself, when you use radians as the units.  Derivative of sine is cosine.  Derivative of cosine is negative sine.  Derivative of negative sine is negative cosine.  Derivative of negative cosine, brings us back to sine.  When you introduce degrees as the units of this function, you end up accumulating a pi/180 factor, every time you take a derivative.   This makes it a lot more complicated with all the further applications of calculus and trigonometry together.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "0GkmnPdD6jY", "cid": "Ugyodgeru2hGhn8rurB4AaABAg.8afFWY2N63Q9D8ddARqh-i", "comment": "54\u00edg\u00f1\u0153m\u00eb546", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "0GkmnPdD6jY", "cid": "Ugyodgeru2hGhn8rurB4AaABAg.8afFWY2N63Q9R48ojSgS_D", "comment": "It should really be called kuklometry, to reflect the fact that it is defined from circles for all angles.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
