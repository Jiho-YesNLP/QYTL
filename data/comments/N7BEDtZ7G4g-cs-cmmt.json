I just have 1 doubt. If i need to subnet the network for 2 host (like between 2 routers), i'll need 4 hosts(2 for link + 1 Network ID + 1 Broadcast). converting 4 to binary 100, so the subnet will be 255 . 255 . 255 . 11111000, which will provide 8 hosts per subnet, whereas I need only 4, (and the subnet 255 . 255. 255. 11111100 will give exactly 4 hosts).
