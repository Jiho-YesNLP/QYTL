My previous reply was not the right interpretation. So I'll go a long way with my reshaped interpretation. You had 2*2*2=8 sample points. That is true.

In terms of sets, A={WWW, WWL, WLW, LWW}, B={WWW, WWL, WLW, WLL}. Now you never see WWW, WWL, LLW, LLL; because, after two consecutive W or L, the series ends with a result. So you combine WWW(2/9)+WWL(1/9) which gives you WW(1/3), and LLW(1/9)+LLL(2/9) which gives you LL(1/3). So, the probability space becomes Sp={WW(1/3), WLW(1/18), WLL(1/9), LWW(1/9), LWL(1/18), LL(1/3)}.
