The Bible clearly states that listening to preaching should be done with caution, contemplation, and discernment, rather than being dictated by pastors.

I literally just proved it on a tissue in like 30 seconds for the positive integers. All even numbers can be written as 2k for k being natural. Every even larger than 2 therefore can be written as 2(k+1). Let k=1 and we have that 4 is the sum of 2 and 2 which are primes. Now assume the proposition is true for k. Then 2(k+1) = SUM(primes). Now for the k+1'th case, we have 2((k+1)+1)= 2(k+1)+2=SUM(primes) +2 , which is the sum of some primes plus 2 which is a prime, so it's a sum of primes. So if it's true for k it's also true for k+1, and we shown in the beginning it's true for 1. let k be one and its true for k+1=2, now let k be 2 and its true for 3, and so on and so on until we see it's true for all positive integers.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "L3LMbpZIKhQ", "cid": "UgwgZe8N8rp_capBR6Z4AaABAg", "comment": "Shame at 28 mins or so that a video cannot be seen", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "L3LMbpZIKhQ", "cid": "Ugy6MK6S2OQ-yS7VzcN4AaABAg", "comment": "\u2764\ud83c\udf89", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "L3LMbpZIKhQ", "cid": "Ugx1UySdypbqpyEg6RB4AaABAg", "comment": "Awesome proff", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "L3LMbpZIKhQ", "cid": "UgzelKzseqHJWBQivTt4AaABAg", "comment": "Religi\u00f3n Is  true????

This lecture indeed indicates how easy it is, but in reality difficult, to think and parallel everyday life with mathematics. It is really unique to see a very unconventional, for our country's educational standards, way of engaging mathematics in a more philosophical and applied manner than ever.

I often listen to consults that by thinking that you will never attend any such classes in person or be able to study them abroad you are only limiting yourself and your dreams. So seeing these is a true way of forgetting my worries for my future studies in Applied mathematics.
