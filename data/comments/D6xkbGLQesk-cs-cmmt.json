Which then actually means that all lines of code that executes within that loop now has a minimum time complexity of O(n). So O(1) -> O(n), and O(n) -> O(n^2), where the arrow actually means, yield.

I'm currently using several of them in the classes I teach. The example below is from Blue Pelican Java Lesson 38 by Charles Cook.  Your last example with the 2D Array and the example below look like the same idea.  However, Cook explains that the Big O value is O(n) because you are essentially adding each element of the 2D array once, that is O(r*c) where r is the number of rows, and c is the number of columns.  Could you explain what the difference is?  public static int[] addStuff(int x[ ][ ])\r {\r   int row, col;\r   int b[] = new int[x.length];\r   for(row =0; row < x.length; row++)\r  { \r       for(col= 0; col < x[row].length; col++)\r       {\r           b[row] += x[row][col];\r       }\r }\r return b;\r }\r Yes, this one is a bit more complicated than the previous ones. Let\u2019s assume we call\r this method with the following code:\r int dfg[][] = { {1,2,...},\r \r                        {0,4,...},\r                              ... };  //Assume this array has r rows and c columns for a\r int newArray[] = addStuff(dfg);  //total of rc = n elements   Studying the addStuff method, we note that we go through the outer loop x.length\r times which is the number of rows, r. For the inner loop we go through x[row].length\r which is the number of columns, c. Therefore, the total number of times through the\r code in the inner loop is rc, which in turn is just the number of elements in the entire\r matrix, n. We can write the Big O value as either O(rc) or O(n).", "votes": "5", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "D6xkbGLQesk", "cid": "Ugx4-bLFhS5XzOwpV214AaABAg", "comment": "This is by far the best explanation of time complexity and how to calculate it for any function that I have seen on YouTube.

Now in your example where you have each sub_array of size 4, you're still adding a linear ammount of element per each sub_array, therefore if your array_2d is size 5 (5 sub_array of size 4) you're doing `total += i` 20 times, and if your array_2d is size 10 (10 sub_array of size 4) you are doing `total += i` 40 times, array_2d of size 15 would be 60 operations and so on.
