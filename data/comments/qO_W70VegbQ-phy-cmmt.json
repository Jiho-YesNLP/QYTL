Imagine firing electrons at the double slit so slowly that  each electron reaches the back wall before the next electron is fired.  If you do this for a long time so that many electrons are fired through the slits, one after the other, and then make a plot of the distribution of their locations on the back wall, you'll find that the distribution exhibits the same interference pattern.  Clearly the electron is not interacting with other electrons as it passes through the slit because you only fire one at a time.

An object's location can be determined by visual inspection within an uncertainty of approximately 550nm, visible light. If we are looking at a stationary object, for example a ping-pong ball with mass of 0.0027kg, the minimum uncertainty in the momentum is given by \u0394p\u2093(5.5x10\u207b\u2077m)=(1.005x10\u207b\u00b3\u2074Js)\u00f72 \u0394p\u2093=9.59x10\u207b\u00b2\u2079kg m/s. This means the minimum uncertainty in the velocity is \u0394v=\u0394p\u00f7m \u0394v=(9.59x10\u207b\u00b2\u2079kg m/s)\u00f70.0027kg \u0394v=3.55x10\u207b\u00b2\u2076 In order for the ping-pong ball to move a perceivable distance, 1\u03bcm, it would take t=distance\u00f7speed t=10\u207b\u2076m\u00f7(3.55x10\u207b\u00b2\u2076m/s) t=2.815x10\u00b2\u2070s  or 89 billion centuries. Clearly this is clearly a long enough time to know the position and velocity precisely enough to use classical mechanics. But according to quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle, if the ping ping ball were known exactly to have 0 velocity this would imply the uncertainty in position is infinite. Since we know that we are able to perceive the location of the ping pong we must surmise that the ping ping ball does have some velocity. So even though the ping pong ball is not actually stationary, its motion is imperceivable.  Compare the earlier calculations to an electron with a mass of 9.11x10\u207b\u00b3\u00b9kg moving around an atom with size 0.1x10\u207b\u2079m. In this case the minimum uncertainty in momentum \u0394p\u2093=5.3x10\u207b\u00b2\u2075kg m/s and \u0394v=(5.3x10\u207b\u00b2\u2075kg m/m)\u00f79.11x10\u207b\u00b3\u00b9kg= 5.8x10x10\u2075m/s already we can see that the minimum uncertainty in velocity is much higher. In order for an electron to move a distance of 1\u03bcm it would only take  t=10\u207b\u2076m\u00f75.8x10\u2075m/s = 1.724x10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9s From this we can get some intuition behind why the movement of an electron is difficult to pinpoint.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qO_W70VegbQ", "cid": "Ugj7nMwvxkro5ngCoAEC.8TlUrH-ghTq8gLajShQszH", "comment": "according to the relativity theory, nothing is at zero velocity.

That kind of misunderstanding is the reason we get people like Deepak Chopra using what one professor on Sixty Symbols once called \"quantum woo\" (stating that there's something metaphysical about a mind because it's required for the observer effect...even though it's not).   Specifically: the measurement problem has nothing to do with knowledge, but about measurement. And there's no way (that we know of yet) to measure something without interacting with it. Hence, if you measure something, you've interacted with it, and the interaction is what causes the collapse--the interaction is an observation.  The delayed choice quantum eraser experiment is also not about knowledge; you may be interpreting it as being about a conscious decision having an effect on the quantum state, but that's not what it is, either. Once again, this experiment is about measurement. The way you measure a quantum object determines the way it manifests (as either a wave or a particle). The delayed choice experiment assumes that the photon (in the most common form of it) has already manifested as either a particle or a wave upon its creation, and then changing how you measure it somehow changes that manifestation, thereby assuming that your measurement in the present \"altered\" the manifestation in the past when the photon was created. That's where the paradox comes in. But it's only a paradox if you assume the photon was in either a wave or particle state from the beginning, and more recent experiments have shown that's not the case. In reality, the photon is in a superposition--that is, it's a wave and a particle at the same time. Only once it's measured does it collapse into one state or the other, so your decision on how to measure it after its creation doesn't matter, only the way in which it ends up being measured--again, it's about how the interaction occurs, not any kind of knowledge, decision, or consciousness.  And there's no such thing as \"interaction free collapse\", at least not as far as I can find any information about; the closest thing I've found talks about \"interaction free measurements\", but it specifically explains that they're not truly free of interaction, only minimized interactions (and from what I can tell, the definition of \"interaction free measurement\" here means \"interactions are only with virtual particles\"--but that still means interactions are occurring!).", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qO_W70VegbQ", "cid": "UgjFBBhAdq8OMngCoAEC.8Pv8FTocOEd8Q0FqWSPmCl", "comment": "Unfortunately an \"observer\" IS a mind.

Since my keyboard doesn't have the Greek letter lambda for wavelength, I will substitute L for lambda.  Further, c is the speed of light, E is energy, f is frequency, h is Planck's constant, m is mass, p is momentum, and v is velocity.  The De Broglie equation is L = h/p.  Also, the wavelength of a photon is found through E =hf = hc/L, so L = hc/E.  Additionally, E =m(c**2) (or m(c squared)).  Therefore, L= hc/mcc = h/mc.  p = mv, so for a photon, p = mc.  In conclusion, I get L = h/p for both the wavelength of a photon and its De Broglie wavelength.  One problem is that photons don't actually have mass, because they are traveling at the speed of light.  However, they do seem to have momentum, as light can actually push or move an object, such as a photon sail proposed by those speculating on modes of space travel.

As explained in the video, we need to think of the particle as waves (having momentum) or particles (having position). The Fourier transform let's you go between these different spaces (momentum space / position space) but it kind of \"bundles up\" a range of values into a single value when changing space, and that gives you the uncertainty.   For example, imagine a sinus wave, just a wavy rope going from the left to right. Now, rotate your viewing position to one end of the rope so that the wave travels straight from your position. From this point, it would look like a vertical line. So even if the wave was very irregular with different heights at different nodes, from this perspective, we would only see a single vertical line. We have thus \"bundled up\" a range of different values, and we can't be certain what the height of the rope would be at different positions, but we know it's within the range of our vertical line.  So the uncertainty principle is a purely mathematical restriction which was known long before quantum mechanics, but took a practical meaning after the discovery of quantum mechanics.", "votes": "370", "replies": "6", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qO_W70VegbQ", "cid": "UgjIsY74oa0bq3gCoAEC", "comment": "Here is my interpretation of an example of uncertainty:  If a particle A is detected, it has been struck by a photon B or let's say an electron B.  B ricochets off of A and next strikes the human eye, the electron microscope, or whatever (the dectector, so to speak).  The eye or microscope registers the collision of B with itself.  However, the data can only suggest where A was at the time B struck it and bounced off.  In the meantime, A will have moved.  Not only that, B's collision with A will have caused A to bounce away from where it was, change trajectory, or both.  While we might be able to predict about where A might be, the data suggested by the collision of B with the detector will be at least slightly in error, unless A is so large that an overwhelming cancellation of forces due to many naturally occurring collisions causes the collision of B with A to have a negligible effect on the position and/or trajectory of A.  However, if A is very small, the uncertainty increases.  Of course if A is much more massive than B, this factor will also decrease the effect on A of B's collision with A.", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qO_W70VegbQ", "cid": "UggT3APmfyyGlHgCoAEC", "comment": "A pretty girl talking quantum physics to me.

While pilot wave theory being fun and all to make videos about, it carries no value at this time. It doesn't predict any effect quantum mechanics doesn't, and math is so complicated that everyone gave up on describing known effects. Pilot wave theory is a joke at the moment. On one hand Copenhagen (or any other accepted interpretation) of quantum mechanics: - Hard to understand model - which been amazingly successful allowing us to build computers - describe all know particle effects - predicted a bunch of new effects confirmed with experiments - has more or less approachable math which allows us to do everything above On other hand Pilot wave theory: - looks simple at first glance for ape brain which must have stuff hitting stuff - doesn't predict anything new - have really hard time describing anything past double slit experiment - math gets complex so hard so fast that no one cares about it - no practical value - Veratasium dude made youtube vid about it  Did I miss something?
