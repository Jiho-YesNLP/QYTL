I just want to see an introductory programming book that doesn't teach functions/methods/the other name that Crash Course listed that receives good reviews, as it must get good reviews if it is the only thing that teaches people to make anything productive.  I have significant experience with MIT App Inventor, Python, and Java. If you can either explain how \"nobody ever uses these applications for anything productive ever,\" give examples of \"productive\" Python software that doesn't use functions, or give examples of \"productive\" Java software that doesn't use methods, then you might have a point.  In truth, the issue of using functions and methods is a question of efficiency within a program rather than productivity, as doing such may actually be slower than something else.  In reality, unless a program demands insanely optimized efficiency, then using Functions speeds up development time while reducing errors.  In Software, doing something like this would be inane compared to coding certain parts of an application in a lower level language so as to reduce a bottleneck of lag.  In Application Development, Functions and Methods can speed up development time and reduce errors at downside of a usually unnoticeable amount of lag.  In Scientific Programming, Scientists who specialize in a discipline such as Biology or Psychology as opposed to Computer Science can use a simple high level language like Python for practically anything they would need themselves.

Unlike while loops, for loops also keep the variable(s) inside the loop's scope, which both frees up the variable names for reuse later on (so that you don't need to come up with new names for each loop), and makes sure that old loop variables can't be used somewhere else by mistake.   Example:  int i = 0; while (i < 10){     print (i);     i++; } int j = 0; while (j < 10){     // Bug! This is actually an infinite loop since j never increases. With for-loops, this can't happen.     print (i);     i++; }  To make them the same, you would also have to wrap the while loop in curly brackets, like this:  {     statement0;     while( expression ) {         DoSomething();         statement1;     } }", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "l26oaHV7D40", "cid": "Ugg775BPlCcCVHgCoAEC.8SftEcxPYeO8Sg3_14bOFX", "comment": "Jecel Assump\u00e7\u00e3o Jr, I think you might have posted to the wrong comment.

Many introductory programming assignments will be programs that fall entirely into this category.  However, this only represents a subset of the vast array of problem types that a a developer working on a larger application typically needs to solve.  If the application is interactive in any way, it is going to need state, and a way of updating that state incrementally over time.  Similarly, object oriented programming might be a decent way to organize parts of that state... the parts that look like self contained objects.  But not all data and functions are best organized this way.  Applied indiscriminately to the wrong problems, object oriented designs can introduce huge layers of extra complexity and even cause code to be less modular instead of more.  There are lots of available abstractions in programming, and many of them are orthogonal.  Learning one set of abstractions in no way locks you out of adding other independent abstraction concepts to your tool belt.  Over time experience with mixing and matching different techniques will build your intuition about where each approach works best.
