This is how the Black Scholes formula works without needing any ridiculous useless math , the market makers are all divisions of big banks such as Goldman , JP Morgan etc , they create liquidity by taking both sides of the trade from both retail and all managed funds like your 401k , all these banks are like a Casino or a regular insurance company , their only goal is to keep the premium you pay when you buy a call or a put , they want to sell only to people intending to use options as insurance only and let the options expire worthless , but given options values are derived from stock equities and indexes in the market it means that the value of options will have to change as well to reflect the volatility of the underlying asset it represents , so this price movements attract speculators who have no intention on either taking delivery of the stock and or let the options expire worthless , the speculators want to make money from the options themselves , the market makers hate this because they lose money when a speculator wins , here comes the Black Scholes formula to the rescue of the Casinos/Stock Insurance sellers in Manhattan aka Goldman Sachs and the gang to ensure speculators lose their money even if they are right about the move of the stock... How is that possible , because the time decay component is built to destroy speculators in a very smart way which I won't explain here ... But this explains it very simple , the Black Scholes formula is only meant to protect the market makers on both sides of the trade... The business model of a casino and insurance company is simple , the customer loses and they win ... Are we all so masochist to enjoy getting ripped off ?????
