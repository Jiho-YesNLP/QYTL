The idealized model that was considered was the Black Body. (Max von Laue called the black body the \u201cKirchhoff vacuum.\u201d It was also called the \u201cultraviolet catastrophe\u201d; the first signs of the \u201cvacuum catastrophe\u201d)\r 2- In 1900, Max Planck solved the \u201cblack body\u201d problem by discovering the \u201cquantum of action of light - h\u201d. Particle (h) is not a hot particle emitted by stars. Particle (h) came from the vacuum, from the cosmic vacuum.\r 3- Einstein's second postulate states: In a vacuum, light propagates at a constant speed (c), which does not depend on the speed and radiation of the source or observer.\r 4. According to SRT, a quantum of light is not a solid particle.\r 5- According to quantum physics, a quantum of light has its own internal \u201cspin\u201d (linear or angular).\r 6- Light is an independent and free quantum particle. Its movement does not depend on the speed of the source or the observer. The actions of light do not depend on the opinions of physicists.\r #\r \"All these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me no nearer to the answer to the question \"What are light quanta?\".

Plank discovered that the energy of EM waves is not continuous from zero to infinity. They can only have discrete values that are a multiple (1,2,3,....ect) of the frequency times a constant value (Planks constant). He found this by trial and error, and it perfectly solved the longstanding problem of predicting black body radiation. Plank considered his finding a \"mathematical trick\", but shortly afterwards, Einstein discovered that light behaved as packets (quanta) of energy perfectly described with Planks constant. So, the constant wasn't a trick, it was part of a real quantity in nature.
