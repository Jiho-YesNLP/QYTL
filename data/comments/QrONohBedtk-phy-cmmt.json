Every insulator has some finite resistance. So even at low voltage, a small amount of current will pass through. If you have an object with 50 megaohms of resistance (50 million ohms) even at 1 volt you'll still get 20 nanoamps.   Then at a high enough voltage you get what's called breakdown where the electrons are ripped off of the atoms, providing a low resistance path of ions which allows a great deal of current to suddenly flow in the form of an arc. This is what happens with lightning and sparks from static.  The idea of an insulator taught in textbooks is what's called an ideal insulator, which has infinite resistance. Bt nothing in real life has infinite resistance. For most cases though it's okay to think of them as being ideal, though because the amount of current is so tiny that it's insignificant.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QrONohBedtk", "cid": "UgxG9AMwg0l2vODhQ7t4AaABAg", "comment": "Congratulations my man!!!! 1MIL what!?
