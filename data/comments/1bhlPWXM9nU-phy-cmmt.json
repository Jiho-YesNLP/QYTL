The potential they gain is 1.5 V. That is one battery. Now we place another battery underneath it. The same electron gets attracted to the second cathode, but is instantly pushed down to the anode thus gaining an additional 1.5V. When the electrons get pushed down to the second cathode, the reason why it maintains that potential from the first battery, is because by the time the electron gets to the second cathode, there is an electron that pushes it down. It in a sense does lose the potential energy, but it instantly regains it because of the other electrons coming down on it. At least this is how I think of it.
