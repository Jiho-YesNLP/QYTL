That's because they're the same line. Imagine you have an xy plane. If you start at 0 and go up to positive 3, your y value increased by +3. If you start at 0 and go down the y axis to negative 3, your y value increased by -3 (or it decreased by +3). You can't say that both moving up and down the y axis are equivalent to increasing by +3, because they're two distinct actions. That's why both North and South can't be positive. One must be \"Up\" and one must be \"Down\", which is the same as saying one must be positive and one must be negative. The same logic applies to East and West: one must be right, one must be left -> one must be positive, one must be negative.

If something is going to the right it's gonna be in positive.

I can see why people are confused at this, I was too but the final - initial is a different formula and can't be used in this unless we take 0 as initial and 4 as final (which is not something he mentioned in that 6:16 problem) so for this one either just do the right - left formula or go an extra mile and figure out the final and initial yourself.
