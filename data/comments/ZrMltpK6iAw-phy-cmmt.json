That's OK  The beauty of science is that you can approach the principles from several directions. While an engineer (and the more practically-minded non-scientist) will want to work down from real-life observations, pulling the processes apart as they go, the physicists I've met tend to build their understanding from the bottom-up. Perhaps the approach has been let down by the format - ideas such as dielectrics deserve a full episode but the series has a lot to get through.

Lets bring it closer together a few times:  2/0.5   = 4;  2/0.25 = 8; 2/0.125 = 16;  If we reduce the distance by half 10 times we get 8192 times the capacitance. If we do it 30 times we get 8589934592 times the capacitance and we only have to bring the plates 1.86e-9 m = 1.9 nm closer together to double the capacitance once again.
