Because to understand those oncoming trains of information we first need to make sure we have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. While these are a good refresher for uni students further down the line, these course are particularly for the incoming students or students who will attend different unis.  And it so happens to be that they, as a perk, share most of these introductory lectures on MIT Open Course Ware platforms for the general public. Which I think is awesome for other folks. At least i know that it was for me before I got in the uni. I used  to watch these during exam weeks and refresh my knowledge.
