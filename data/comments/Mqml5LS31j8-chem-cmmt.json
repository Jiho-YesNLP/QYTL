How about taking into account of the Change in Temperature? Does it makes sense if we take Change in Temperature as the basis to tell whether exothermic or endothermic???", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Mqml5LS31j8", "cid": "UgxPqzMSBl_oZOeq40l4AaABAg", "comment": "Dear Sir,  I am a student from Australia. Your video lectures are excellent. I have a question on ionic compound solubility (NaCl in water) which my textbook and other videos on youtube channel could not give me a satisfactory answer. The answer I got from was that: When considering why the compound is dissolved, we must consider 3 intermolecular forces: Solute - solute, solvent - solvent and solute- solvent IMF. In the case of NaCl, the solvent - solute IMF is ion dipole force which is a strong IMF therefore it will overcome the solute - solute IMF (ionic bond). However, the ion dipole force is clearly weaker than the ionic bond. I could not figure out how the ion dipole force could break the ionic bond. Furthermore, it could not explain why some ionic compounds such as silver chloride is insoluble in water.  Your expert opinion is much appreciated.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Mqml5LS31j8", "cid": "Ugjf9n9xOAn1IXgCoAEC", "comment": "Thanku so much sir.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Mqml5LS31j8", "cid": "UgjuTfKC3EhepHgCoAEC", "comment": "thanks!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Mqml5LS31j8", "cid": "Ughk6cwXO9rpwngCoAEC", "comment": "a new fan of AK LECTURES ! <3 Thank you for all the helpful videos, they are always very detailed and super informative, yet you make it very simple to understand :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Mqml5LS31j8", "cid": "Ugham07C31zkwngCoAEC", "comment": "Very helpful video!
