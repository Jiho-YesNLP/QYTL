You're applying the chain rule, just like how you'll use the chain rule to solve any other function.  And the reason why it's in respect to y for the outside function is that the way you differentiate a composite function is to first difference the outside one with respect to the inside function. Multiply that with the derivative of the inner function with respect to its variable. For y^2, the inner function is y. So since the chain rule differentiates the outside function with respect to the inner one, the outside function (Y^2) will be differentiated with respect to y (the inner function.) Then multiply with the derivative of y respect to the variable it's representing. Y, is representing a function (something happening to x) its not a variable itself in this instance, so the variable within the function of y is x, that's why the inner one differentiated with respect to x again.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "M0SMSWM2oZA", "cid": "Ugy1AXeMIN8Qy4178Jd4AaABAg", "comment": "Simple expression, thanks\ud83d\ude43", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "M0SMSWM2oZA", "cid": "UgzxHy2p_NIpCeesXzp4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you so much!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "M0SMSWM2oZA", "cid": "UgyuUjgMC0eqGie0ORJ4AaABAg", "comment": "I'm sure you get an increase in views during finals- and its well-deserved!

Also, here in the video he just goes over the steps. Sure, there are moments where he explains why some things are the way they are which is helpful but not in the same sense as in the lecture. Lectures from math professors cover more than how to do problems. They cover the reasons why more in depth.
