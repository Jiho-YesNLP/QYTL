They relate to the special case where these specific heat capacities are the constants of proportionality between change in temperature and heat added to the system, but they apply outside this context as well.   Cv is the proportionality constant between temperature an internal energy, while Cp is the proportionality constant between temperature and enthalpy.  And this is true, regardless of whether volume or pressure is constant in any situation.  And since both enthalpy and internal energy are state functions, it doesn't matter what path we take.  The difference in these thermodynamic energy values still applies.  Cv and Cp do have some dependence on temperature, so it isn't an exact proportionality.  But it is close, and these values aren't very temperature sensitive, so you still get meaningful results by assuming they are constant with temperature.  In this particular application, U=Cv*T is the way we calculate internal energy at each point of interest.

It also gives you guidance for how to fine-tune the geometry of the engine for the greatest efficiency.  This way, given a target power rating of the engine, you can determine the stroke, the bore, and the clearance volume, from the theoretical efficiency of the Otto cycle.  And when you monitor the pressure and volume at every point along the way in a real engine, it does closely follow the theoretical curve of the Otto cycle.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Qi3m9sD5w-A", "cid": "UgxPmNdR9fixjRVLWct4AaABAg.9H3FlsfoND79bemZeSe13X", "comment": "What school you go to?:", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Qi3m9sD5w-A", "cid": "UgzsCBK_rwnKees6PvV4AaABAg.98hsJ7k3ATX98pUBjdz9uZ", "comment": "\u2206T is negative beacuse temperature is reduced in the second step hence the work is positive.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Qi3m9sD5w-A", "cid": "UgzsCBK_rwnKees6PvV4AaABAg.98hsJ7k3ATX98quT9YorW7", "comment": "shahzan ahmad ohhh!

Before proceeding remember that \"thermodynamic temperature\" just means we're using a temperature scale with 0 being the absolute zero like Kelvin or Rankine.  Let T_h be the thermodynamic temperature of the heat source, and T_c be the temperature of the heat sink. Then, the thermal efficiency of Carnot engine equals 1 - T_c/T_h. So even the perfect thermal engine cannot have the thermal efficiency of one. Imagine that your engine takes heat from the source at 100\u00b0C (373.15 K) and dispenses of it into a sink at 0\u00b0C (273.15 K). Than your engine can never be more efficient than (1 - 273.15/373.15) * 100% \u2248 27%.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
