Work is a change in energy, and energy is defined as the ability to do work. Two main types of energy discussed are kinetic energy and potential energy. 04:43 \ud83c\udf10 Potential energy can be gravitational or spring potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is calculated as mgh (mass times gravity times height), while spring potential energy is half times the spring constant times the distance squared. 06:39 \ud83d\udd04 Some systems can lose energy through work (non-conservative), but conservative systems, like a simple pendulum, do not lose energy. Energy changes between kinetic and potential, and their sum remains constant. 08:01 \u26a1 Average power is defined as work over time, measured in Watts (Joules per second). It quantifies how much energy is converted from one form to another over time, with an example of calculating average power in pulling a box.

May be gravitational, electrical etc. If you take gravitational potential energy, let's say at the top of a hill, the gravitational potential of a ball is the highest. As it falls down, the potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the potential at the top. Another example: in a spring, the average force applied from rest to compressed state is -k/2 times x. The work done in compressing the spring is naturally -k/2 times x squared. This work done according to work energy theorem is stored as elastic potential energy and is interchangeable. So, that potential energy does work on an object which, let's say, requires a thrust from the compressed spring. Directly answering your question, both have the capacity to do work. Don't get confused with the word 'potential'.

Basically, you have all your forces, masses, distances, speeds, etc, all combined in such a way that you get a number that remains constant. This makes calculations far easier, and you can back track to get other values that may be a pain to calculate.  For instance, if you are calculating the speed of a roller coaster at the bottom of a hill, then without work-energy theorem, you would have to do a vector integral to add up all the forces on the car at every point in time.  With work-energy theorem, you know that the potential energy at the top of the hill is m x g x h. At the bottom of the hill, all that potential energy is now kinetic energy, which has the formula 1/2 x m x v^2. Since energy is conserved, you just have to throw them together. mgh=0.5mv^2. This simple equation takes into account all the changes in force over all time, but is astoundingly simple, because we are able to relate the properties of a system to a value that remains constant.  This may not seem like a big deal, but it really does go far in simplifying everything. Especially fluid dynamics. Though in fluid dynamics, we use a similar idea called \"head\". Its units are length. It is essentially energy of raising that particular fluid that distance. But this is also constant (unless there is a pump), so you can convert between velocity, height, and pressure fairly easily.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w4QFJb9a8vo", "cid": "UgiPeuY-1cG2pHgCoAEC", "comment": "I think crash course needs some course work to help people practice on a weekly basis.

In quantum mechanics, this is known as \"quantum fluctuations\".  A practical example of this in action is Hawking radiation, whereby two particles at a black hole's event horizon pop into existence. One of the particles zooms off emitting radiation. The other particle goes into the black hole and promptly annihilates with an existing particle to cancel the debt that these two particles owe to the universe.

Noether's theorem relates energy conservation to time translation symmetry. If I do a set of experiments on a physical system today, and I repeat the experiments tomorrow (or any later time), and I find the same results, then the system is invariant under time translation, and only then is energy conserved. The condition of time translation invariance may appear to be trivial, but it is not.  In the context of cosmology it does not apply, because the universe is expanding. So if we study a system on a cosmological scale, an experiment at a later time is essentially different from an earlier one. For example, the density of the universe is less at the later time, and the temperature of the cosmic background radiation, and so on. In that case energy is not even EXPECTED to be conserved.

In GR the use of a Local Inertial System, e.g. a free falling reference frame, guarantees that locally (i.e. to the extent that tidal forces can be ignored) all physics goes through just like in flat spacetime.  In physics accuracy and error margins are always essential. Whether an effect is small or large matters greatly.  The universe, in the way it is usually understood, does not have any things outside it, so the concept of a closed system cannot be meaningfully applied to it.  The non-conservation of energy on a cosmic scale has little to do with the notion of a closed system, and everything with violation of time-invariance and Noether's theorem. The fact that invariance under time translation underlies energy conservation is not always fully appreciated, because in many simple situations (the ones  considered in school) a simpler conceptual framework suffices.

Also, in the absence of any forces (total) momentum will be conserved, and that's crucial for describing, say inelastc collisions. Kinetic energy is just the energy of motion. For free classical particles we have KE = (p^2) / (2m) In general, momentum and energy are related. Momentum is conserved if a system is translationally invariant (i.e. if you shove the system a bit, keeping everything else the same then the physics remains identical, just as if you didn't move everything. But if the system is sensitive to spatial translations, then that symmetry is destroyed and momentum may not be conserved). Similarly if a system has time translation symmetry, i.e. if you push it a bit in time instead of space, then the energy (kinetic plus potential energy) is conserved. So energy could be thought of like the time equivalent of momentum - in fact it is written as the time component of the 'four-momentum' (a vector of the energy and the three spatial components of momentum, which is commonly used in relativity).
