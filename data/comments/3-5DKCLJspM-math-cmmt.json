If you're as a positive number on a number line and you take away, you move LEFT towards 0. If you're at a negative number on a number line and you take away, you move RIGHT towards 0. Similarly, if you're at a positive number and you're adding, you move RIGHT away from 0. If you're at a negative number and you're adding, you move LEFT away from 0. - For additions/subtractions, think of the first number as where you ARE, and the second as the DIRECTION and how FAR you are going. If I'm at -10 and I'm adding 5, I'm moving 5 further away from 0 than -10, so I get to -15. If I'm at -10 and I'm adding -15, then I'm moving 15 CLOSER to 0 than -10, which takes me PAST 0 and all the way to POSITIVE 5. - For multiplication and division, remember the direction/distance metaphor for add/subbing, but remember that you ALWAYS start at 0. 5x5 is 0 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5, we usually just omit the 0, and it's the same for all other multiplications. As such, instead of the first number being where you ARE like with addition/subtraction, think of it as one number is how far you go each step, and the second as how many steps you're taking. The direction still stays the same. For instance, (-15) * 5 is starting at 0, then moving left into the negative numbers AWAY from 0, 5 times in increments of 15, or 0 - 15 - 15 - 15 - 15 - 15, which is -75. - For division, I find it much easier to flip it around into a multiplication. For instance, -75/5. Rather than thinking -75/5, I figure out what I need to multiply by 5 to get to -75. Since we're starting at 0, but 5 is going into positive numbers, we need to flip it around so it goes in the opposite direction  - so the answer is going to be a negative number. So -75 would be 5 * (-15)", "votes": "8", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "3-5DKCLJspM", "cid": "UgyUWXRSu6znelW7Qgl4AaABAg", "comment": "This is helping me study for the asvab!!
