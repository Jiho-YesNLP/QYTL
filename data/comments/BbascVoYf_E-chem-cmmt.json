These cost between 2 and 20 money-units, depending on gold-plating or otherwise. Avoid the cheapest of the cheap - these have a terrible surface-finish and tend to jam. Next, get two identical picture-frames from e.g. Ikea (with glass panes instead of plexiglass, for extra scratch-resistance) and sandwich the balls between the two glass sheets. Use paper-shims (stacked post-it notes or polyimide tape) to create a inter-glass-gap slightly wider than the diameter of the balls.   Avoid the temptation to use a magnet to contain the balls from bouncing off the glass while pouring - the residual remnance makes the \"crystal lattice\" demo less fluid, as the balls tend to clump up. Alternatively, consider using bronze, brass, ceramic or POM balls.
