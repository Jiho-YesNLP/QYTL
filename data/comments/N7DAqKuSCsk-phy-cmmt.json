Work done by different forces are calculated. If they are added together they equal net work. And no matter what, net work always equals change in kinetic energy of the object. So basically, Net work = sum of work done by different forces acting on the object. But understand that Work by each force can be calculated as F*d*cos(theta) so not all forces acting on an object will do work on that object. Also, remember that when calculating work done by conservative force such as gravity, just use the height not the actual displacement because work done by conservative force is independent of the path covered.
