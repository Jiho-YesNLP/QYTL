It's a good course and I feel I've learned some things.  There is one thing that I think needs to be said, though.   Often when popular coverage of this arena is circulated, the material is talked about as though it's some kind of black magic - as though computers doing this stuff are \"really smart.\"  But honestly they're not.  Most of these algorithms are completely straightforward and are not too different from what I might have come up with working from a blank piece of paper.  All the computer is doing, really, is doing arithmetic really quickly.  There is no magic here - nothing \"special.\"  Grind grind grind, get an answer.  Probability theory has been known for going on a century now - it's not magic either.  I think that rather than call this \"machine learning,\" (and \"artificial intelligence\" is an even worse name) a better name would be \"Advanced Probabilistic Algorithms.\"  That name captures the flavor of what it's all about better than the more \"mystique laden\" names.     This said, I wouldn't want to question the value of these methods at all - clearly we can do some useful stuff with them.  But they really should just be part of the toolkit that \"any decent programmer\" can pull out and use.  It's just not stuff that we should be all \"Ohhhhh.... Fancy!\" over.  It's just programming.  The only parties I'd criticize here is the media - they  keep sending this \"Wow - computers will soon be running the world\" message, and I just see nothing in this material that really supports that idea.", "votes": "23", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0rt2CsEQv6U", "cid": "UgzFpQMliSz4fMao8OF4AaABAg", "comment": "1st cmnt", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0rt2CsEQv6U", "cid": "UgwUKqYZ_h3_CHbUGCZ4AaABAg.9hgrIvKBJlE9r_YrUcDHJn", "comment": "max is applied for both the terms and to understand what expectation of quadratic function turns out be it is considered separately leaving out the first term.

A really, really (potentially REALLY) long string of pretty basic math. A lot fun to go through, for sure. Sounds like you and I found ourselves on this journey for roughly the same reason.
