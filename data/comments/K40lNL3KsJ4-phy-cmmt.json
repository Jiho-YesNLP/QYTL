Density of these particles is maximum at the centre of charge and magnetic pole which decreases outward. These particles produce electric and magnetic fields. Electric and magnetic particles are entangled and move in tandem at right angle to each other. Electric flux and electric field are different entities. Electric flux is a physical object while electric field is force with magnitude and direction. There is no electric or magnetic field around single charge or magnetic pole. Electric and magnetic fields appear when fluxes of 2 or more charges or magnetic poles interact. Interaction b/w like charges/poles increases flux density which produces repulsive force field while Interaction b/w opposite charges decreases flux density which produces attractive force field. Assuming electric and magnetic flux is made of microscopic particles, maxwell equations can be modified as; 1st. Equation. \u2022 Electric charge q is made of and is surrounded by  microscopic particles called electric flux. \u2022 Density of microscopic particles/ electric flux at any closed surface is proportional to total charge contained inside the closed surface. \u2022 Interaction b/w fluxes of electric charges produces electric field. 2nd Equation; \u2022 Magnetic pole is  made of and is surrounded by microscopic particles/ magnetic flux. \u2022 Magnetic poles  come as 2 conjoined  opposite poles with  permanent attractive force field  b/w the poles. \u2022 Due to Interaction b/w opposite fluxes,  flux density in the middle of the poles is zero. 3rd. Equation  \u2022 A moving and changing magnetic flux induces moving and changing electric flux which induces changing electric current in a conductor. \u2022  A moving and constant magnetic flux produces  static electric field which can't induce current in conductor. 4th Equation; \u2022  A moving and changing electric flux produces a moving and changing magnetic flux. \u2022A moving and constant electric flux produces static magnetic flux.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "K40lNL3KsJ4", "cid": "UgxyE56G7qbL42Wqshx4AaABAg", "comment": "Beware!

Speed: I know I have a pause button and can watch it at a slower speed. It had always been the routine. But this time they've taken it a bit too far. It's okay to stretch a video from 10 mins to 15 mins. The viewers won't treat it as a long video. If you still insist to keep it short, try reducing the content rather than cramming everything into 10 mins. 2. Content: A lot of secondary details overshadowed the actual content of the course. The intention of watching a CrashCourse video is to understand a topic in the simplest way possible, and not just brushing up what we've already learnt. The content seemed like a summary of the chapter aimed at someone who's already studied the topic. If I were new to Maxwell's Equation, I'd as lost as I'm in the classroom. So the whole point of this video becomes moot. 3. Delivery: Dr. Shini is a brilliant physicist, and could've done a lot to make us appreciate the topic. Rather she just gives a flat delivery of the script like the evening bullet news. It's not just the speed, but it seemed more like reading notes straight from the book. I'd love it if She could weigh the important concepts more heavily and let the secondary equations run in the background as additional reference. 4. Creativity: Fancy colours and cool animations to the content didn't just cut it. Please try to make us visualize what you're presenting. I was eagerly waiting for an \"Ah! ha!\" moment when she was explaining the equations. The math and all was cool, but if it was just those equations and their derivations, we could've gone back to books. Expecting more efforts in making us realize the beauty of Maxwell's Laws rather than the nitty-gritty.

The disconnect in my opinion is when these equations bring back skeletons from calculus because when you arrive at this class you most likely have already went through calc1,2,3 and most likely in DE, you can about imagine how much you can forget and most physicists don\u2019t bother reiterating fundamental concepts of calculus in reference to physics, mathematicians don\u2019t like to explain how things relate to physics and focus purely on the mathematics.

This is one possible wave. It has infinite lateral extent, and this prevents it from spreading. To generate such a wave with any degree of accuracy, you need a source that is much wider than the wavelength. If the source is too small, the waves will diverge.  To get the right wave form corresponding to any given configuration of sources (moving charges), one needs to solve Maxwell's equations (with appropriate boundary conditions for the behavior 'far away'). All the phenomena of diffraction etc. can thus be described.  Maxwell's equations are linear. This means that one can take linear combinations of electromagnetic fields and these are again solutions to the equations. This provides ways to systematically construct solutions that are useful in further theoretical development and also in some practical situations. One approach is to synthesize solutions by adding plane waves. This is always possible, except at the very locations of the point charges (where the field is singular). So in this sense the plane wave is 'typical' and things we learn about it can be carried over to the more general case. BTW this synthesis of plane waves is called taking the 'Fourier transform' of the solution.  There are other ways to systematically synthesize solutions. One of particular theoretical importance is the so-called 'propagator' or 'Green's function' (there is some subtle nomenclature issue here, which I ignore). The idea is to solve the equations only once for a source consisting of a 'kick', i.e. a charge/current distribution that is located entirely in one point in space and one moment in time. Never mind the practicality of this for now: we just do the math. This yields a spherical wave that propagates outward from the source in a certain way (with a radial fall-off as you indicate). Now we synthesize any practical source configuration by taking a linear combination of 'kicks'. This is always possible. And we obtain the em-field for this extended source as a linear combination of 'kick solutions' or 'Green's functions'.

It's just an indication, that needs to be verified by observation. That's important, because there is lot's of theoretical math out there, which leads to predictions, that are completely in contrast to reality/observation.

Without economics no research and no science. Without electronics we'd still be somewhere in the stone age, but without economy we'd also be there too. My personal gut feeling (and it's indeed nothing more like that) is, that the influence of economics overall on mankind is significantly vaster, than that of a single natural scientific progress, even if it is some stroke of genius as Maxwell's equations and even if it had such a massive impact.

When you do not understand something and there are no pauses it's easy to fall behind just like in a normal Course. Sure you can pause the video yourself but i'd argue that should not be nessecary.    However I do not know what philosophy the creators of this Channel have for their content. Is it their philosophy that you should pause, go back and repeat certain parts of the video for \"The complete experience\"?  If so then fine, i understand their choices of editing. If not then i'd say they're doing their viewers a slight disservice.( Note the SLIGHT part).  In the end education is not a black or white issue. Some people like this format and learn best from it and others do not. I am arguing that more would understand the discussed subject better If more pauses were added.   I am also not sure If I think it is crashcourse's job to make us \"learn\" this subject but to introduce us to it via easy to understand mathematical arguments and broad strokes. They have absolutely succeded in this when it Comes to the content of their videos but not always in the implementation and i think this series is an example of this. It's a great series but a bit fast-paced for many people.   Plz don't hate me crashcourse employees! I loves your videos but because this is a subject close to my heart i get a bit critical.

You dropped a 1/2 factor from your result. The mistake is in the E=IVT step. You suppose that I and V are constant here, but really, if V is constant I can not be. Not counting resistance, if V is constant I increases uniformly in an inductance. This results in P not being constant, and hence PT is not E. In that line you have to insert an 1/2 factor. To derive this properly, you have to use integrals, or reason based on graphing the power in time, and calculating the area under it.
