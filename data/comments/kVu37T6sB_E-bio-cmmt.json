Recombinant DNA, Cloning, and Editing on the Overall Subject Matter of Molecular Biology (MIT Introductory Docency of Biology): 1) Cloning is the Process of DNA (Genetic Purification) Segregation (Identification and Propagation) and Homogenization of Genetic Matter; a) Chromosome (Nucleoid Nucleus of Prokaryotes) Plasmid Cassettes of Bacteria (Antibiotic Resistance Mechanism) in DNA Form (encoding Thereof); 2) Cloning Steps (Process); a) Cut DNA by Restriction Endonuclease (DNA Specific; EcoR1 for 5'3;GAATTC;3'5'CTTAAG Sequences; 5' Overhang with Sticky Ends) or Kpn1(Sticky Ends and 3' Overhang) or EcoRV (Blunt Ends); b) Vector (Plasmid with Origin of Replication and Elongation of) and Insert (Foreign DNA as In Eukaryotic to Prokaryotic; DNA of Interest); c) DNA of Interest Investigations; b) Mixed Pieces will have Base Pair Complementarity Affinity and Unity Thereby (5' Free Adenine Phosphate and Absence of Covalent Bond within the Nucleotide [Endonuclease Reaction]; also there is 3' Hydroxyl within the Adjacent Nucleotide) of the Top Strand [Idem for Down Stand in Palindromic/Complementarity]); c) Ligation via DNA Ligase will Catalyze Bonding Reactions of Covalent Bonds Type thereafter, Namely Phospho-diester Bonds; 1) This can also be portrayed as Recreation of the EcoR1 Site; d) Selection of DNA of Interest or making of a DNA Library (Multiple Possible Phenotypic Manifestations for Which Selection is also Possible);  1) Screening is the Selection of a Phenotype/DNA Recombination of Interest (Genotype Modification) that Meets the Criteria Of the Study (Perhaps the identification of a Protein Of Interest); b) Selection would involve the Phenotype/DNA Recombination Clone Selectivity via Environmental Selection (Medium Alternation to Where only the Cloned Desired is promoted and all other Excluded);  c) Antibiotic Resistance Mechanism is a Possible Selection Mechanism; 1) Transfection of Antibiotic Resistance and Selection Thereby; 2) Functional Complementation where an Auxotroph (Mutant Organism who Fail to Produce A Nutrient [Induced Deficiency]) or Prototroph (Self-Sufficient Organism); b) Leucine Auxotroph Transformation (Transfection of Leucine Prototroph Gene Attributable to Metabolism); c) Selection for a Defect-Rescued Organism (Via Culture Selection); c) Yeast Cell Cycle Mutants (Temperature Sensitive Mutants) is Conditional for Temperature.  1) Paul Nurse (2001 Noble Prize Laureate) Cyclin Dependence Kinase in Humans (Genetic Assessment and Identification) 2) Rescuing Phenotype Of Transfected (Laboratory Modality) Mutant Yeast to the Point of Rehabilitation of Previously Mutant Yeast; Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an In Vitro Approach of DNA Amplification (Denaturing [Enzyme and Heat De-combination], Recombination [Forward/Reverse Primers], Annealing (DNA Polymerase Addition; Function of Repetition); 1) DNA Specific; 2) Amplification thereof for Positive Identification; Genome Editing (Genomics and Gene Engineering; also known as DNA Recombinant Technology; 1) CRISPR CAS-9 Gene Editing Modality (DNA Excision); a) Double Strand Breaking (DSB); b) Cleavage Specificity Modality and Mechanism; c) GAATTC is not Human Specific (1/4096 Plausible Sites); d) RNA-Guided Endonuclease (Cas9) implies the Sequence of the Gene or Area of Gene is known (mostly a theoretical Approach but Improved Genomic will assist); d) Human Genetic Disease Correction or Reversal via Gene Editing in clinical Trials and Ultimately the Vanguard of Medical Therapeutics; e) Bacterial Antiviral Mechanism (Monera Immunology Specifically Anti-virus) by Specifically Bacteriophage viruses de-combination by Clusters of Repeated Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR is Pathological DNA Sequences Identification system); b) Heritable Immune System of Bacteria Transfection to Human Cells for Therapeutics possible of DNA Excision and Introduction;   PhD Adam Martin, es sehr gut zu lehren Wiederstellung Der Maennern weil Mensch soll nicht Krankheit und Armtum Sein.
