Displacement is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point, along with the direction. Speed Speed is how fast something is moving. It's the distance traveled divided by the time it takes. For example, if you run 100 meters in 10 seconds, your speed is 10 meters per second (m/s). Speed and Velocity Speed is just how fast you're going, without considering the direction. Velocity includes both speed and direction. So if you're running at 10 m/s north, that's your velocity. Average Speed and Average Velocity Average Speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It doesn\u2019t consider direction. Average Velocity is the total displacement divided by the total time taken. It takes direction into account. Acceleration Acceleration is how quickly an object changes its velocity. If a car speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it's accelerating. It's calculated as the change in velocity divided by the time over which the change occurs. Gravitational Acceleration Gravitational Acceleration is the acceleration of an object caused by Earth's gravity. Near the Earth's surface, this acceleration is about 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). This means that every second an object is in free fall, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s. Projectile Motion Projectile Motion is the curved path an object follows when it's thrown or propelled near the surface of the Earth. It involves both horizontal and vertical motion. For example, when you throw a ball, it moves forward and also falls downward due to gravity. Newton's 1st Law Newton's 1st Law states that an object will stay at rest, or keep moving at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force. This is also known as the law of inertia. Newton's 2nd Law Newton's 2nd Law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma). This means that how much an object accelerates depends on the force applied and its mass.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "b1t41Q3xRM8", "cid": "UgwtCzC9megHK29YBMd4AaABAg.A6JcMmeSHt9A75YgCi5odo", "comment": "Too late.

Is your child having difficulty in math and physics, or worse flunked a subject? Then, that's your fault as a parent.   There's no valid reason anymore for students to flunk math, chemistry and physics!!! As parents, your obligation is to share these links to them.   Do you have children or relatives or friends in grade 7, 8\u00a0 9, 10, 11, 12 or 1st year & 2nd year college, all the way to 5th year? No reason they will flunk anymore.   I was an engineering professor before, and I tell you these videos are the best preparation any high school or college student could have.   (If you're a teacher, share this with students and your class will improve immediately!!)   You don't need a teacher or a tutor anymore. These videos will guide your student into becoming a Summa Cum Laude.   Why? Because if you can understand math and physics, you can understand any topic such as political science or business management easily. Therefore, Summa Cum Laude.   Let them watch these videos in advance, and repeat over and over again.    Here are links to videos that will make them number 1 in the classroom for chemistry, math,\u00a0 & physics   Note: These are YouTube Playlists, meaning, each link has many videos in each; some with 300 videos per link.
