You may be confusing the concept of a general vector space with the subspace test. If you have a known vector space V and you have a subset W of V, how do you know whether or not W is a vector space (under the same vector addition and scalar multiplication as V) on its own?   Since W shares the same operations as V, W inherits many of the axioms of a vector space from V being a vector space. The only ones which are not guaranteed are the two closure axioms and the existence of a 0-vector. Because 0v = 0-vector for all vectors v in V, it turns out that showing W has the 0-vector is equivalent to showing W is nonempty, provided you know W is closed under scalar multiplication. So you can replace \"closed under addition and scalar multiplication and has the 0-vector\" with \"closed under addition and scalar multiplication and is nonempty\".  But as I pointed out, the above paragraph is the test of a subset of a known vector space being a subspace. If you have a set with an addition operation and a scalar multiplication operation, but if you don't know it's a subset of a known vector space with the same operations as that known vector space, then you have to check all of the vector space axioms.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "EP2ghkO0lSk", "cid": "UgzMDDv9WUNkXC-76654AaABAg", "comment": "Concise yet Comprehensive!

Instead, you should think of subspaces as answering the following question: If I have a known vector space V, and I have a subset of vectors from V, when can I say that this subset is, in its own right, a vector space, using the same vector addition and scalar multiplication as V uses?\"  A lot of people do not emphasize the \"same vector addition and scalar multiplication\" part, but it's actually super important here.   So let's say you have a vector space V, and let's call your subset W. In order to check that W is a vector space in its own right, we should check all of the axioms of a vector space. But because every vector in W is a vector in V and because W uses the same operations as V, a lot of the axioms are automatically true for W because they are true for V.   For example, one of the axioms of a vector space is to check that, for all vectors x and y in W, we need x+y = y+x. However, all vectors x and y in W are also vectors in V. And in V, we know that x+y = y+x. And since W is using the same vector addition as V, since we know x+y = y+x in V, we get that x+y = y+x in W too. A lot of the axioms of a vector space have this same sort of reasoning. They are automatically inherited by W since W is a subset of V and uses the same operations as V.  The only axioms of a vector space which are not automatically inherited by W are: closure under addition, closure under scalar multiplication, and the existence of the 0-vector. This is why the subspace test only requires you to check these three conditions. All the other conditions are automatically satisfied because W is a subset of a known vector space and uses the same operations as that vector space.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "EP2ghkO0lSk", "cid": "Ugx5sbgKE8A6g-cgAxZ4AaABAg.9S_X0fdnVceA-5esehvdza", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@MuffinsAPlenty\u00a0thanks man", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "EP2ghkO0lSk", "cid": "UgxsIjMvipXeCqJeOv14AaABAg.9OopZve7Vge9a3Vu3Rg9fL", "comment": "A vector of length 1", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "EP2ghkO0lSk", "cid": "UgxsIjMvipXeCqJeOv14AaABAg.9OopZve7Vge9wRfLinLQaX", "comment": "False.
