In this way, gamma photons of lower frequency and energy than the incident gamma photon would be born. Stationary waves, of high amplitude, behave like an elementary charge in the spiral. When the standing wave breaks, through electro-magnetic induction, a high-power electric impulse would appear, which accelerates the electron in the immediate vicinity and transmits a recoil to the nucleus, which releases the photon from the circum-nuclear standing wave.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hzwykQ7KSRE", "cid": "UgyGQO0Mb-JniGFbGXZ4AaABAg", "comment": "i have my finals in 6 hrs. pray for me.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hzwykQ7KSRE", "cid": "UgymgI32wp9Mbf6_mMZ4AaABAg", "comment": "hot cathode X-Ray tube\r https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-faYwW6CY&t=12s", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hzwykQ7KSRE", "cid": "UgzLrv81gbF2p9yM8Od4AaABAg", "comment": "I don\u2019t understand that calculation for 45 degree", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hzwykQ7KSRE", "cid": "UgyAm4Xc7TZT03m9i2t4AaABAg", "comment": "thanks bro", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hzwykQ7KSRE", "cid": "UgwIXJSIsM_vlbFngMV4AaABAg", "comment": "why is it be cosine untt not tangent or sign \u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hzwykQ7KSRE", "cid": "UgwKiQHR2pqstxYcT0V4AaABAg", "comment": "You should include units into all your calculations.
