Are you implying that you do not think The Designer, The Lord Almighty, and The Maker of Heaven and Earth is capable of coming up with and implementing a system like evolution for his creatures? Please answer this question.  Because the evidence to this point is clear that evolution exists. You won't find a transition species between the Narwhale and the Monkey because eon did not transition into the other. Rather they both evolved from an earlier common ancestor.   There is no deep dark plot here. Science constantly seeks to disprove scientific theories. This is how the scientific method works.

There would be 'in-between' creatures along the path from the common ancestor to the modern form.  But, there aren't any.  There aren't any 'missing link' fossils, despite 150 years of searching for them.  There are profound discontinuities, missing bridges, if you will, common to all types throughout the entire living kingdom.  There are similarities, yes, but still in all, vast distances at the level of molecular biology in the precise coding of the atomic bonds that distinguish between the different genetic self replicating structures possessed by different creatures that are thought to be branches of the same evolutionary tree.   And even the simplest single cell organism with a self replicating nucleus, having RNA & DNA, has a hopelessly complicated coding that can't possibly have originated by chance bombardment of the primordial soup with flashes of lightning.    The whole system of evolutionary thought makes no sense.  None of what we see in the living world could have come about by chance, no matter how many millions of years you have to work with.   You are laboring under a complete misunderstanding of the nature of Nature.  Nature has no agency.  It can't think.  It can't design.  It can't decide what to do.

Also, please explain this line to me, \"vast distances at the level of molecular biology in the precise coding of the atomic bonds that distinguish between the different genetic self-replicating structures\" Because that sounds like a bunch of scientific-sounding fluff.  Genetics very clearly shows that there can be genetic variation within a species. It's by these same genetic mechanisms that you can get genetic variation resulting in the evolution of a new species.

I believe that He spoke everything into existence in six 24 hour days, and that the beginning of everything that we are able to see and feel and touch came about only a few thousands of years ago, just like it says in Genesis.  There was no need for millions of years of uniformitarianism for things to start to happen, and that this is a perfectly reasonable thing to my way of thinking, precisely because His power is limitless.    As for missing links, I'm not sure which ones you have seen.  All I see when I look back are lots and lots of wonderful, fantastically beautiful creatures that used to roam the earth that have since gone extinct.  Lots of genetic diversity has been forever lost.  If evolution were true, I would expect to find just a few simple, pretty much boring life forms back then in the age of the fossils, and so many more life forms now, a broad profusion of diversity of newer, faster, smarter, bigger, better life forms today.  But no.  The life forms we have left are just midgets compared to what used to be jumping around.  I've heard of a fossil of the skull of a frog, found down in Texas, of such a size that the complete creature must have been six feet long!  Imagine what an incredible sound that thing would have made at night in the pond in your backyard!  If things continue as they have, in a few thousand more years, how many more species will have gone midget, and then extinct?  Probably all that will be left will be some miserable cockroaches.  All those incredible life forms, gone forever.  What a terrible shame.  I don't see any new branches on the evolutionary tree of life.  Just lots and lots of death, creeping up and taking over.  By the way, have you seen the book 'Undeniable' by Douglas Axe?  That's next on my list to read after I finish the Michael Denton book 'Evolution:  A Theory in Crisis'.    Have a good evening sir.

The question alludes to this by saying \"the majority of...\" but not all, because there all single-cell fungi for example. Therefore, multicellularity would be a similar function.   This question is poorly written because 1-the wording leads you to believe that the common ancestor was multicellular, and 2-It assumes you know whether the common ancestor was multicellular or single-celled, which you may or may not have discussed in class.
