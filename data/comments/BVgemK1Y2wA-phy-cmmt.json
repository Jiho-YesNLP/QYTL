We can literally get different answers by using different equations in the \"4th big equations\".  If we use the formula s(t)=1/2(a)(t), we would get s(5)=(-4.9)(5^2)= -122.5. Since distance is a scalar, then we can just remove the negative sign and get 122.5. Since the definition of speed is distance over time (speed=distance/time), then speed=122.5/5 = 24.5. This SHOULD be true because all i did was using the definition. However, the video uses velocity final and speed interchangeably, which also make sense to me. So which one is correct then?  Can somebody explain it to me why i got different answers?  EDIT: I'm 101% sure mine is correct since multiplying my answer by 5 will give the exact distance, while multiplying the video's answer by 5 would give a different distance (feel free to correct me btw).  I think the flaw in the video's answer is that it uses velocity and speed interchangeably. While sometimes it can be used interchangeably, but as we can see here that it doesn't work for this problem because the answer shows the velocity at that exact moment (velocity final), not the avg velocity.

The room begins to head toward Earth with it being oriented such that the floor is closest to the Earth.  The rate at which the huge room is heading toward Earth is based upon the effects of Earths gravity across the entire room. The effect is greater at the floor area since it is closer to the Earth, but again its overall speed of approach is based upon the effects of gravity across the entire room. As a consequence of this, the person who was located near the floor, will begin to move toward the floor, and the person located near the ceiling, will begin to float closer to the ceiling.

John 3:16 says \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son [Jesus], that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\" The gift of salvation through Jesus Christ is the greatest gift ever. Maybe someone on this channel has been feeling lonely or depressed even. I know that God wants you to know that Jesus loves you and that He died on the cross as the payment for the sins of the whole world and rose again and still lives today, and that if you believe in Him you will never ever die but have everlasting life. there is hope for you and His name is Jesus.

I'm 13 and an incoming freshman student. It will be a lie if I said I didn't feel a pang a jealousy reading your comment. Youre progress and dedication is something indeed. For a long time I didn't progressed in my school work and I've always had a hard time. I've never regarded myself as something much more and I didn't really mind it -which now that I think back at  -was stupid. What you accomplished -getting a head of your peers at such a young age and that far ahead  never crossed my mind that anyone would be capable of. At least in the span of 1 year but now I'm filled with hope. I procrastinate a lot and it's hard for me to focus and work on one thing: a routine, a subject. Before this I've been meaning to get into computer programming and writing bc i am having trouble in the literature department and I just can't get myself into that headspace. I hate it! Though, I know it's necessary for me to learn it. I'm sure you went through many moments like this throughout your journey..I really admire you and your dedication If what you said was true. Bc uk not everything on the internet is these days, but even then I'm glad I came upon you. And ik this was posted a month ago but I would really appreciate it if you gave me tips or something to help me a long the way.(I also want to get a head start for the year and get ahead but idk just how far just yet. I need to do more research. But with 2 months I'll try my best. You're a few grades younger than me but I wish to be like you. Also, I bet if you started a tiktok acc and made like a Google classroom you could teach other people and reach more audience. If you do I'd be among your viewers, for sure.\ud83d\ude42 sry this is so long pls do update us on the Chanel tho.
