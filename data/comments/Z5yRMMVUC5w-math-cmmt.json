Answer: because for a smooth function, the linear approximation using the slope is good enough in the limit. It also has bounded variation as a function.  So why isn't that good enough for Ito's lemma? Because the Brownian motion isn't smooth. In fact, as a stochastic process it has quadratic variation. This means that (dB)^2 and dt grow at roughly the same rate. So if we're going to keep the first order terms, then we also have to keep (dB)^2 as well.  So it's not that we're not getting rid of the second order terms and above- we are- it's that we're forced to keep one of them as it contributes as much as a first-order term.  But since it is only quadratic variation, it's safe to throw all the higher order terms away.
