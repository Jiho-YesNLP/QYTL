Thanks for watching! I am actually working on a website right now. YouTube is horrible with organize videos and topics. If you go to the inroganic chemistry playlist, all those videos are in order.

Like in this case, the number of shells remains the same but the number of protons changes. Your statement would be correct if we were talking about a normal situation where the next atom after Neon  gains a proton AND an electron. The addition of that electron would in fact add another shell level.

We are talking about isoelectronic atoms here. That means, by definition, the two atoms have the SAME number of electrons but different number of protons. So, the next atom after Neon gains a proton but does NOT gain an electron. That means, since it has the same number of electrons but more protons, the nucleus pulls the SAME number of electrons closer, thereby decreasing the radius.

An atom with ten protons is Neon, meaning that the next atom up should actually get bigger rather than smaller because it gains another valence shell (because it goes down on the periodic table) ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
