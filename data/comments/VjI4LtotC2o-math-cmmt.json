(\u2020)From the compound angle formulas(\u2021) for sin & cos, you get double angle formulas for those, and from cos2A you get: 1\u20132sin\u00b2A=2cos\u00b2A\u20131=cos2A => 2=2(cos\u00b2A+sin\u00b2A) Therefore: 1=(cos\u00b2A+sin\u00b2A)  (\u2021)Proof in this video: \u201cAngle sum identities for sine and cosine\u201d by blackpenredpen", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VjI4LtotC2o", "cid": "Ugwc0V_CUb-0vvWHtrZ4AaABAg", "comment": "thanks dave you cured my cancer", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VjI4LtotC2o", "cid": "UgwBs09ikB95dLg8XQd4AaABAg", "comment": "what a relief", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VjI4LtotC2o", "cid": "UgzHsMZ9IpYElh4c0UJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Completed 59/165  05/08/2023", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VjI4LtotC2o", "cid": "UgwsZndnaUN-QFE828V4AaABAg", "comment": "thanks for explaining your video really helped me a lot in my maths project.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VjI4LtotC2o", "cid": "UgwAbzTu3AZt3zHN7Ah4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you Dave so much!
