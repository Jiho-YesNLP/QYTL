I have a question : in the example of the titration of weak acid with strong base, at point A you calculated the molarity of HCO2- (0.00421). Then 5mL of NaOH was added wich produced 0.0250 M of HCO2-. At point B to calculate the pH you have considered that the initial molarity of HCO2- was 0.00250 and not 0.00421+0.00250. Why ?
