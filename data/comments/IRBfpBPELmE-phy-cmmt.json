To put it simply, it actually does. However, it is not what one would think. Some may pass through but will not form an image for a person to see as it is nowhere near what the source produced. Light is a particle when observed. So when we want to measure things we are doing it while considering it is a particle. When we leave it  alone, a interference pattern forms just like in the video thus it behaves as a wave. Light does not require a medium but it depends on what you consider mediums. The vacuum of space in my case is not exactly a medium and light travels through it. And to clarify, those microwave cookers use microwaves to cook, WIFI (depends)normally uses microwaves to travel. And now. Photons are light. And all the EM waves are carried by photons cause there are just different energy levels. So one POSSIBLE way to think is that the visible light (you are talking about) is unable to form through a medium as the photons are blocked out by walls and thus the reason why you CAN see the wall. This is possible but then again we are just diving into the world of quantum mechanics. No explanation is correct currently.
