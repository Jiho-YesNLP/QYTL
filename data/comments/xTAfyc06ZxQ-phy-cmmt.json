I would be grateful if u make a video about this. I tried it so many times but still came up with the same answer which is 7.6 m/s. It should be less then V1 which is 5.75 m/s.  Water is flowing through a pipe of two circular cross-sectional area A1 and A2 lying at a height difference of 25 cm. The pressure difference between the two cross-sectional areas A1 and A2 is 15000 Pa. If the velocity of water through the cross-section A1 is 5.75 m/s, what would be the velocity of the water through the cross-section A2?

Make sure that you're taking into account if there is an increase in height or a decrease between points A and B. If you already know that the velocity should be less at point A than at point B, and we assume that both cross section areas measure the same, then we can can assume that the change in velocity is ony dependant on a change in pressure. Now, we know that if the speed decreases, then the pressure increases. And if the pressure increases, it is because the height decreases.
