It is the build up of the basic foundational concepts that make some other things easy. \r For example, in determining if a matrix is invertible:\r In the earlier lectures, Prof Strang said that matrices can be seen as a set of operations that are acted to another matrix. An example is the elimination matrix E, we use it to change the rows of another matrix. Given that, what if we want to reverse those operations? This is where inverse matrices come in, the inverse of E is the matrix that will reverse/inverse the operations of E itself, that is where the term \"Inverse\" comes from. So another way of seeing it is (inverse of E) * E * A = A or (inverse of E) * E = I since I * A = A.  Then, how do we know if a matrix is invertible (that is, its operations can be reversed)? It is invertible if there doesn't exist a linear combination of the columns of A that is the zero vector except the zero combination. Why is that so? One of the easiest way to reason with it is explained in the earlier lectures: if Ax = 0 and A is invertible, then we can multiply both sides by the inverse of A and we will get x = inverse of A * 0 or x = 0. Therefore the value of x should only be zero for the right hand side to be zero.  There a lot of other ways (and better ways, for intuition) to think of this, and the other lectures give insight to that. \r But now, you can easily see if a matrix is invertible or not by just looking at its columns, if it's small enough.  =================================================================================================================================================  In order to understand how he multiplies matrices so easily, you need to understand the point of the first 3 lectures.

From what I saw,  the difficulty level, very honestly, is pretty standard too, they basically test you on the basics, they normally don't set you something super advanced or esotoric at this level and all of it is based on the material taught in class. What really seems to make the difference, as OP pointed out, seems to be the quality of teaching. And of course, it helps that they usually select the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, among the applicants. But many other universities in other countries do that too, often by significantly raising the difficulty level of the entrance tests - such as in India and China - and at the end of three years or four years, the students usually still come out knowing far less than their MIT counterparts. There are several reasons US universities have a Reputation\u2122 :P  and the quality of teaching is one of them.
