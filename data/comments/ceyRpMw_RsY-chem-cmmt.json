You are correct in principle.  In promoting an electron to a higher energy orbital you create an excited state which should technically be paramagnetic.  But excited states typically have lifetimes on the order of femto- or picoseconds before they relax back to the ground state.  So I don't know if they are around long enough to have a measurable effect, and also the promoted electron should be equally likely to have either spin.  So half the time the excited state would have one spin and half the time the other.  Averaged over time, we might suspect that these effects should cancel as well.  But we're devolving into the theoretical here and I'm just shooting from the hip, so take what I say with a grain of salt!\ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ceyRpMw_RsY", "cid": "Ugw7BypeTG8IPde4PBN4AaABAg.9pxTvKTwwow9pz12tkJIUd", "comment": "You're welcome!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ceyRpMw_RsY", "cid": "Ugwu7MVFIz7atMZheQJ4AaABAg.9pQXmyBuqCE9pSWTVi-Xf0", "comment": "Kudos on the grade improvement.
