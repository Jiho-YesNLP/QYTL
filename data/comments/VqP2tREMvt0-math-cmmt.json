I really appreciate professor Strang and MIT for making this gem of a lecture available online, but I felt he presented a few tricks like the block matrix one for finding the spanning set of the null space of a linear map (a linearly independent one*, too, because of that I block) in a rather hand-wavy manner.   Perhaps a better way to visualize it is as follows:   1. Draw the RREF matrix as staircases with pivots, preferably with interlaced free columns for generality. 2. If there are any all-zero rows at the bottom of the RREF matrix, trim off that part. 3. Pluck out a free column from the staircase, then turn it sideways (90 degrees counterclockwise.)  4. Multiply each component in the free column by -1, to reverse their signs. (This is for building the -F block) 5. Insert the \"selector\" (coefficient of 1) component at the same index as the index of the extracted free column in the RREF matrix. 6. Insert \"N/A\" (coefficient of 0) components at the same indices as the indices of the rest of the free columns in the RREF matrix. 7. Now turn the free column back to its original position (90 degrees clockwise) 8. Put the finished column in the \"special solutions\" matrix. 9. Do the same with the rest of the free columns in the RREF. 10. In the special cases where F is NOT interspersed with the I in the original RREF matrix, what you get is a matrix with the -F block stacked on top of the I block.  P.S. The point of plucking out a free column and then laying it on its side is to make the step 5 and 6 easier to visualize.  *If only one column vector has a non-zero entry at a specific row index in a set of columns, then there is no linear combination of the rest of columns in the set that is equal to that column. That is why the special solutions matrix built this way always contains a linearly independent set of columns.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "VqP2tREMvt0", "cid": "UgxN9NIynH5oUKvKp_J4AaABAg.9aDoF-XVjuG9tdX4AlqT9E", "comment": "This really bothered me.

To begin with, I use the content in 27:25 to answer your second question.\r On the right part of the blackboard, you can see the professor labeled the 2*2 identity matrix (pivot columns) and the 2*2 matrix [2 -2 ; 0 2] (free columns) in 3*4 matrix R.\r Compare R with the equations in the middle part of the blackboard, and you will realize that he already switched the column 2 and 3  (coefficients of x2 & x3 in equations).\r To make sure the possible answers (vector X) are still right, you should also switch the row 2 and 3 in X.\r So we have X' = c[-2 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0]  + d[2 ; -2 ; 0 ; 1]\r Put these two 4*1 matrices together,  and you will see the 4*2 matrix N = [-2 2 ; 0 -2 ; 1 0 ; 0 1].\r Compare N with R, you can see the upper 2*2 of N is the so-called -F, and the lower 2*2 of N is I. (The columns of N should be the same as that of F, and that of I is also 2 here is just a coincidence.)  Now turn back to your first question with the content in 42:17.\r Remember that X is a n*1 (3*1 here) matrix. Therefore, to be more specific, the -F in X is actually \"a\" column derived from F = [1 ; 1]. Last, the 1 in X represents the first (and the only) column in 1*1 identity matrix I. (Don't be bothered about the 2*2 identity matrix in R. The number of I's rows in X should only equal to that of F's columns in R.)

He generalized this notion by defining the matrix R using placeholders I and F for the identity matrix (I) and the matrix formed by the free columns (F), with possible rows of 0s beneath. Since he was generalizing, he wrote R as a block matrix (where I and F represent matrices).   We know I has dimensions r x r (since I is the identity matrix formed by the pivot columns, and the number of pivot columns = number of pivot variables = rank = r) We know F has dimensions n - r x n - r (since F is the matrix formed by the free columns, and we know there are n - r free columns).  So our original Ax = 0 can be rewritten -- throughout the whole process of his lecture -- as Rx = 0. He then wonders what would the solution of this matrix equation would be.  Well, since defined R generally using I and F, he unintentionally (I am assuming given how pleasantly surprised he sounded) was defining R as a block matrix, he decided to find all the special solutions at once in which he called a null space matrix N.  This N would solve the Rx=0 equation, i.e., would make RN = 0 true.  Well, knowing how matrix multiplication works, N needs to be a matrix that, when multiplied with the row(s) of R, would produce 0's.  Since the first row of R is I F, what linear combination of I F would = 0? We would need to multiply I by -F, and F by I (because then we'd have -F + F = 0). This is how to look at it pure algorithmically. Dr. Strang actually uses wonderful logic. If the first row of R = [I F], then of course we want I in the free variable row (the second row of N) in order to preserve it, and to cancel it out, of course we would need -F in the identity row (the first row of N) in order to cancel out the F in the free variable block of R.  This is how he knows the null space matrix N is always going to be [-F I] (obviously written as a column, but I can't type that out in this comment).  He then goes further to show us how this actually is not surprising. Going back to Rx = 0, remember that R (as a block matrix) = [I F]. x = [x_pivot, x_free] (as a column matrix).  If we actually did the matrix multiplication we would have:  I * x_pivot  + F * x_free = 0. Solving for x_pivot we get:  x_pivot = -F * x_free  So, if in our solution we make our free variables the identity (remember when Dr. Strang said \"hey, these are free variables. Let's make them whatever we want. Let's make x_2 = 1 and x_4 = 0\" and later he said \"hey, let's make x_2 = 0 and x_4 = 1\"), then by the above equation, of course x_pivot HAS to be -F.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "VqP2tREMvt0", "cid": "UgxnZuFa8X5u8eJNPYd4AaABAg.9GEvbkKgPdrA2b2mlC7bjH", "comment": "\u00a0@toanvo2829\u00a0 F has dimensions r x n - r (NOT n - r x n -r), no?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "VqP2tREMvt0", "cid": "UgxRhy9x-4uPO1d3n2N4AaABAg.9GEe4rwkA759GysrT4iEud", "comment": "If you think of each row as a  polynomial equation, then the zero pivots mean the coefficients of those variables are zero.  So it doesn't matter what value  you assign the variable, it doesn't change the result.  I think of it this way.  Imagine a straight line going through the X-Y plane of your computer screen.  ax + by = d.  Then imagine that line in 3-D (X-Y-Z) space.  What is the z-coefficient?  The z-coefficient is zero.  a*x + b*y + 0*z = d.  So it doesn't matter what value I use for the variable z because the z-coefficient is zero, and I get the same straight line that never leaves the X-Y plane.  He has an equation with zero coefficients for two of the variables, so he can put any value for those variables without changing the result.  So he just picks the values that make his calculations easier.  You could use other values for the special solution, but it won't change the result because the coefficients are zero.  So he picks 1 for one of the zero pivot variables to make his calculations easier by yielding the identity matrix, and he picks zero for the rest of the zero-pivot variables just to get rid of them.  I think if he had three zero pivots, then he'd pick [1,0,0] or a variation of that.  For four zero pivots, he'd pick [1,0,0,0], and so forth.

Since you've set x2 to 0 in all the other special solutions, it doesn't matter what you multiply those special solutions by.  When you combine all the special solutions, you will get x2 = 7, or any other possibility.  You do the same for the respective free variable in the other special solutions to get any possible value for that free variable.

I think it's simplest to see why this is the case in reduced echelon form, as opposed to echelon form, as I'll explain:   Remember that we're just solving a bunch of coupled linear equations represented by Ax = 0.  Around 9:57 he shows you how the matrix equation Ax = 0 is just encoding these linear equations.    So we start off with a matrix A that has numbers everywhere in it, which means x_1, x_2, x_3, and x_4 appear in all three equations.  We can add these equations together and multiply them by numbers without changing the solution set, which is what row operations do.  However, by doing this we can simplify the equations so they're easier to solve.  For instance, we started with three equations but after doing row operations found we really only had two. So far so good.    The most you can simplify the equations with row operations is called \"reduced echelon form\", which he starts talking about at 19:02.  Notice that, unlike at the start, there are two variables, x_1 and x_3, that now appear in ONLY ONE equation each.  We call such variables \"pivot variables\".  Appearing in only one equation each makes them special because it allows us to obtain solutions in the following way: imagine starting off with the values of the all the variables at 0, so the equations are balanced.  Now make the rest of the variables (x_2 and x_4) to be whatever you want, which will make each equation no longer equal to 0 as it should be.  But then, since the pivot variables only show up in one equation each, you can then tune them individually to re-balance each equation again to 0.  To find out what to tune them to, you just solve for them in terms of the non-pivot variables.  Essentially, appearing in only one equation each allows you to \"undo\" the mess you made by choosing the other variables to be whatever you want.  This imaginary process will clearly always work, so we can always choose the non-pivot variables to be whatever we want, and hence they are \"free\".

If I have an equation x_1 + x_2 = 0, I can choose x_2 to be anything, and then solve for x_1, or I can choose x_1 to be anything, and solve for x_2.  The important thing is that I have only one degree of freedom to play with, so the solution is a line.    With multiple equations, it can be harder to tell how many degrees of freedom you actually have because any given variable can appear in more than one equation, so by choosing some set of variables to be free may be fine in one equation but break another.  Deciding that the leading non-zero entries in a row denote the pivot variables and everything else is free will always work though, by the reasoning I gave you above.  Of course, you could have chosen different variables to be \"free\", but you'd need to be careful.  If you like, you could imagine first interchanging the columns of the matrix, which doesn't change the solution set (x_1 + x_2 = x_2 + x_1). Then you could follow the same algorithm Strang gives you, and as long as you know that the n'th column no longer denotes x_n, you'd find some of what you used to call pivot variables are now free and what you used to call free are now pivot.  Note however that the number of free variables and pivot variables will never change, and it isn't always possible to change one to another (for example x_5 = 0 is never free because it's always 0).     The important point is that the number of independent solutions is invariant no matter how you choose free and pivot.  The number of free variables both represent the number of independent solutions and the number of numbers necessary to specify any particular solution.
