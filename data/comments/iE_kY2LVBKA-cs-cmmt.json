If more devices need to be connected, then additional ports or devices like switches or hubs would need to be added to the network. However, this limitation doesn't mean that a peer-to-peer network is not scalable. It's still possible to create a large peer-to-peer network by connecting multiple smaller networks together through intermediate devices like switches or routers.
