Say you have two independent vectors in R3. I'll call them V and W. These form a subspace because they form a plane that goes through the origin. Let's call this subspace A.   In set notation (or algebraically), this subspace can be defined as A = (cV + dW | c,d  are Real numbers)   Now let's suppose you have another vector Y that goes through the origin as well. This is a line. It is a subspace because any combination of that line will either fall on the same line or be 0. Let's call this subspace B. In set notation, this is B = (cY | c is a real number).   Now there are at least 1 way and at most 2 ways these two subspaces can intersect. If vector Y is independent from W and V, then subspace A intersect B = 0 (they both pass through the origin and this the Zero vector is their only common element). 0 is a subspace so we are good.   Now suppose line Y is not independent and is this some linear combination of vectors V and W. In that case Y is already in the same subspace A of V and W. That means that  (cY = dV + eW | c, d, e are real numbers).

For example, a \"determinant\" might seem weird if you just follow the pattern \"take the product of these numbers, then subtract the product of these numbers\" etc etc etc, but really, a detereminant is just a possible pivot that has to be nonzero in order to create a pivot in every row.
