The PRESSURE is the Force that accelerates the mass of the exhaust. But as the rocket nozzle applies a FORCE (the is the \"Action\") on the mass of the exhaust, the mass of the exhaust gas applies a force BACK on the nozzle (This is the \"Reaction\"). You ARE aware of the statement \"For every Action there is an equal and opposite REACTION\" Does that sound familiar?  So when the rocket nozzle applies the FORCE that accelerates the exhaust gas OUT of the nozzle, the exhaust gas MUST REACT by applying a force BACK ON THE NOZZLE.
