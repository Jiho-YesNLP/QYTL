Start by focussing on the amount of CO2 and H2O produced. We want to know how many moles of Carbon and Hydrogen atoms are in the original compound to find its formula. So using the molar mass of CO2 and H2O respectively, figure out the moles of each compound, then how many grams of Carbon and Hydrogen you have in the 2 products. You can then figure out the mole ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen which will give you the empirical formula.
