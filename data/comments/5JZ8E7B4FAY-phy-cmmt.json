I hope most read comments or some to get an idea to watch. Please watch, but if you are not building something and just trying to grasp the concept weather it is cordless tools, car repair or watch the meter go around, let's start simple.  \"Watts\" are measured with math but an \"Amp\" meter. 99% of DIY guys / gals use a digital multimeter or amp clamp. This is \"P\" for power, he my kids and the \"HE Man\" toy. So, P over \"I\" X \"E\" is PIE. Everyone likes pie except it is Pelosi because it is American. If you measure two of any, you can forgive out the 3rd.    It is the same for \"Ohms Law\" except no Matt Dillion. E = electromotive potential over \"I\" = Amps and \"R\" is resistance\" like kissing a cheerleader on a first date. (Note: Yours will vary). But ohms law is E over I X R in a circle. I & R are multiplied while anything under E is divided. Like Mary Ann in your dreams from Gillian's island.    Amp is cool. P=power but measured in amps, so the vacuum you want in your shop is proudly rated at 12 Amps. Sales guy will say this 12 times at least. We know it plugs into the wall so the \"E\" measured in voltage is 120Vdc. Now, 12 amps divided by 120 volts is 10 ohms of resistance. Strong motor (Some smaller, some bigger) 10 amps is about right! Just don't play with small cats when on. Have a lucky one!

My mind goes well does this exist and that's what I'm asking right now does anything else exist as far as this formula goes am I going to encounter something in the future when I don't have my cell phone to look up anything and need to know what milliamp seconds is, for instance. Because if I don't at least see the formula one time there's no chance I'll get it right even though it's basic conversion trust me that's just what happens, mental illness sucks.
