Example: 96 times 10^(-5) divided by 6 times 10^2 becomes 1.6 times 10^(-6). 29:34 \ud83d\udd04 When subtracting numbers in scientific notation with like terms, simply subtract the coefficients. 30:47 \ud83d\udd04 When adding numbers with different exponents, convert one to match the other before performing addition. 31:48 \ud83d\udcd0 Converting smaller exponents to larger ones for addition makes calculations easier. 34:02 \ud83e\uddfe When subtracting in scientific notation, focus on the number with the smaller exponent and convert it to match the larger one before subtraction. 36:11 \ud83d\udd04 Calculating square roots in scientific notation involves separating into two parts and applying the root to each part. 38:43 \ud83d\udd04 Square root of numbers in scientific notation requires converting the coefficient to a perfect square. 40:45 \ud83d\udcc8 When squaring numbers in scientific notation, square the coefficient and double the exponent. Example: 4 times 10^(-3) squared becomes 1.6 times 10^(-5). 41:41 \ud83d\udd04 When raising a number in scientific notation to a power, multiply the exponent by the power. Example: 5 times 10^4 raised to the third power becomes 5 times 10^12.
