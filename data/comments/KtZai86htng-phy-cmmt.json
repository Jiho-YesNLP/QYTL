Is your child having difficulty in math and physics, or worse flunked a subject? Then, that's your fault as a parent.   There's no valid reason anymore for students to flunk math, chemistry and physics!!! As parents, your obligation is to share these links to them.   Do you have children or relatives or friends in grade 7, 8\u00a0 9, 10, 11, 12 or 1st year & 2nd year college, all the way to 5th year? No reason they will flunk anymore.   I was an engineering professor before, and I tell you these videos are the best preparation any high school or college student could have.   (If you're a teacher, share this with students and your class will improve immediately!!)   You don't need a teacher or a tutor anymore. These videos will guide your student into becoming a Summa Cum Laude.   Why? Because if you can understand math and physics, you can understand any topic such as political science or business management easily. Therefore, Summa Cum Laude.   Let them watch these videos in advance, and repeat over and over again.    Here are links to videos that will make them number 1 in the classroom for chemistry, math,\u00a0 & physics   Note: These are YouTube Playlists, meaning, each link has many videos in each; some with 300 videos per link.
