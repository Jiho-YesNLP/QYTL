From 29:38, we start to learn about the second order integrated rate laws,  and when we are deriving the equation, -d[A]/dt = k[A]^2 comes up. However I thought the equation should be -(1/2)d[A]/dt=k[A]^2 because we see that the coefficient of the reactant A is 2. Is there anything that I missing? Or is she just considering the tendency in the second order?", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "PJFW3Vrv-5w", "cid": "UgjH7IcvtczwKXgCoAEC", "comment": "Thank you!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "PJFW3Vrv-5w", "cid": "Uggsa_wNCfEWhHgCoAEC", "comment": "Really good!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
