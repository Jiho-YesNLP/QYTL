At 7:42 we see arrows that indicate what direction on the axis would be positive on both ends of the axis. Then, looking at 8:09 If we choose  the x axis to point towards the upper right corner, then in our fs would be positive and Fgx would be negative. So at 9:15 the equation for net force would have to be F net= fs,max-mg sin theta = -26,29 N since in this coordinate system the box moving downward is a movement in negative x direction. By the logic in the video with the x axis orientation the box would move up the ramp rather then down, since the resulting force is in positive x direction, i e up the ramp.

It follows that this reaction force (which is ANOTHER NORMAL FORCE) from the bookcase on the floor is equal in magnitude to the weight of the bookcase.  However, by stating that \"The force of the bookcase on the floor is just its weight,\" you're almost implying that the the newton's 3rd law reaction force to the normal force on the bookcase... is a gravitational force (weight) on the very same object, which is nonsense.   See, while it may seem like a minor error here, I feel like many students will get confused about how Newton's third law actually work.

If the net force on an object is not zero, the object will accelerate,;it will not remain at rest. If there is one non-zero force acting on an object, and it is at rest, there must be another force.

Its not that Object B provides an opposite force to counter the force of gravity, its that there is nowhere to accelerate TO.  Gravity is an attraction, but if youre held in place you could be anywhere in the world, or any world, and still not move. you have no momentum if you have nowhere to move, you can be accelerated against all you like, but you wont move if youre stuck to a thing. they kind of explained it with friction, you cant move a massive bookshelf very easily because of friction, but thats not all there is going on, it just has so much mass, that the effective force of gravity is trying its hardest to accelerate it downwards, but it has nowhere to go, so it stays still. When you push it, it has to effectively be greater than the force of friction involved, and the effective weight of the object. On a frictionless surface, you can apply as much downwards force as you like, but its still free to move laterally, because nothing is stopping it.  its as if in the three dimensional plane, the Z axis ended at 0, you can move left and right, but not downwards, theres just no more down you can get. youll never develop inertia if there is nowhere to go.  So, the downwards force applies stress in the real world, you can crack the floor in the real world, or smash the bookcase beneath a few tons of weight, but its still not going anywhere. There is nowhere to go.  The whole concept of an opposite force countering the downwards force is ludicrous, the floor cant apply force, it is sitting still. An object at rest will stay at rest. You can apply as much downwards acceleration as you like, as much force, as you like, but theres nowhere to GO so it isnt going to change, youll just eventually break the floor, and then the force that was already being enacted upon it will take effect, it will fall to the next floor, maybe its inertia will be great enough to break that floor, and so on, but without somewhere to go, acceleration is meaningless.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "fo_pmp5rtzo", "cid": "UghHOn2qkOghUngCoAEC.8DWFjOZRxAX8DXyNUJPpSt", "comment": "+indibindylou Well... that's discouraging.
