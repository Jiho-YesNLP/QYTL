For instance, the derivative of sine is cosine, when the input units are radians, which keeps it simple.  But when the input units are degrees, the derivative of sin(x) is (pi/180)*cos(x).  There is also nothing special about degrees, as we've arbitrarily defined the full circle to be 360 degrees.

You are confusing with period which is 4 pie and general x, they are inter-related but general way of saying sine(4x) not sin(4pie), so to get x first convert this 4 pie into x. which will be x/2 with the formula that he has mentioned.  Hope this can also help you, as I was having this issue but try to sort my own and want other also to understand quickly ).

You can have the domain in units of degrees, it just means that there is a conversion factor inside the function, and that conversion factor accumulates through the chain rule when you use Calculus on these functions.  For instance, the derivative of sine is cosine, when the input units are radians, which keeps it simple.  But when the input units are degrees, the derivative of sin(x) is (pi/180)*cos(x).  There is also nothing special about degrees, as we've arbitrarily defined the full circle to be 360 degrees.   It has its advantage because it can be divided in to an integer by all numbers from 1 thru 10, with the exception of 7.  But radians have the advantage when it comes to further mathematics, such as Calculus, which is why mathematicians prefer radians.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8oEjxGjAeQI", "cid": "UgydhY6PJFMmvJ9N_IV4AaABAg.96-tLbyEO7S9608RL6z0Xv", "comment": "just start at the beginning of the trigonometry playlist!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8oEjxGjAeQI", "cid": "UgydhY6PJFMmvJ9N_IV4AaABAg.96-tLbyEO7S9608oOjQE8s", "comment": "Professor Dave Explains thank you very much I had just figured it out and I just want to say I love your stuff and please keep these educational videos coming :)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8oEjxGjAeQI", "cid": "UgyAQfuJYw8eDr7O8eJ4AaABAg.9-XMvX1FfoC9SRtJdm4MyW", "comment": "Gradeoff What part about it?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8oEjxGjAeQI", "cid": "UgxSlR9DQhUipv9yCmN4AaABAg", "comment": "Getting me on track, prof dave", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8oEjxGjAeQI", "cid": "UgybgWtPzJjssUT2Ut54AaABAg", "comment": "Could you maybe explain how to do the tasks at the end?", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8oEjxGjAeQI", "cid": "UgysFbq6pU6uDcbZckp4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you for this video, sir!
