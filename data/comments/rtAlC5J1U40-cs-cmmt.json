And that would be great! But I also have some critics, hope a useful feedback:  A. Host is talking far too fast. B. Not all technical facts are correct. Example - The reason for few MB of cache is not the SIZE of the DIE. Is the COST of the SRAM, i.e the cost of CACHE memory. Back in time, when we speak of KB,  again COST was the biggest obstacle and first factor regarding CACHE Size. Manufacturing process changed, so die size could've been scaled, but it was not reasonable to do so. Already having the SRAM cost to the roof, leaves nothing for other expenses in the pursue of bigger Cache size and perf boost. So the barrier was and still is COST of SRAM. Nowadays you have CPU & GPU on the same DIE, so the die size is not the main factor today, was not a factor back then. Hope that's clear. I think this is one of the straightforward examples of wrong information.  Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration, because these series have good potential. For fluent or advancement speaker sure it's no problem the pace of the presenter, it's rather engaging. But for the bigger audience of non-native speakers... most definitely a big loss of audience. And probably that same audience, group of people, will not even going to try to see another video from the series. That would be a loss for the series in my opinion. As well and for those people came to seek information or just watch a cool informative video , which to be honest is even more of a reason to reconsider the pace.  KUDOS for the effort and outcome.

This will tell you the D-MIPS number for your computer. But this program tests operations with integer numbers (like 42) while some applications do math with floating point numbers (like 0.0745 or 1.6e45) instead. So an interesting number to know is how many FLoating point OPerations per Seconds (hence FLOPS) your computer can do.

I find it interesting that it seems like CPUs are doing more with less these days. Less electricity, less heat production, etc. Well the good ones, at least. I recently got myself an ASUS G11 as a graduation gift. I am amazed at its power for having such a marginal clock speed. It's an I5 6400 rated at 2.7ghz, but it typically runs at about 3.0-3.2 due to Intel boost technology, however that works! LOL Anyway, my old I3 3rd Gen has a higher clock speed but can't touch this thing. I suspect it has to do with more cache memory and more advanced circuitry. Not to mention it's on a decent ASUS board and paired with 16gb DDR4. It's also running a GEFORCE 1060 6gb GDDR5 GPU. Even with a 2.7ghz CPU this thing runs 4k games, videos, etc without a hiccup. The better games in 4k use mid-high settings when optimized, while full HD it runs just about everything at ultra. It also seems to me, based on my limited understanding and research, that while AMD's newer CPUs boast high clock speeds, they also use a lot of wattage and produce considerably more heat than Intel's. Just my understanding, feel free to chime in on that.

Whereas computer science includes a LOT of technical details and may even require a new level of abstraction in thinking (seeing the smaller picture) for those more inclined toward mythology.

Mike Rugnetta already has a large audience.  That is going to boost the Mythology views.  And while Carrie Anne is doing a good job, Mike has much more experience at presenting in this format.  Additionally, you can watch each mythology episode individually and casually.  You can just pick up a few random facts, be entertained, and then move on without much issue.  But for CS, you need to watch this sequentially and in detail to really understand what is happening in later episodes.  For people who are just watching youtube for entertainment, that's a lot of work.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "rtAlC5J1U40", "cid": "Ugj8O404ZvbVs3gCoAEC.8Rq7n49ciCb8RxHR_twS0B", "comment": "Did I say she wasn't good?  No.  I said that she is good.  I've already taken assembly and computer architecture, but it's still entertaining for me to watch her present it.  My point is that she's good, but he's better at presenting on YouTube because he's got a lot of experience doing it.  He's even an example in this article about it: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/the-linguistics-of-youtube-voice/418962/  That is a factor in getting views on YouTube.  It is one of the things that contributes to the difference in view counts between the 2 series.  The thing with the mythology episodes is that you don't even need to know the basics.  If you didn't take in any of the info of one mythology episode, you can generally watch another episode without any issue. Even you feel that it takes knowing some basics already to make it not hard to take the info for the CS series.  So, having \"that audience\" that knows something already for each episode (which might be dependent on learning some basics from the previous episode) is going to be more limited than when the potential audience is nearly anyone regardless of if they know the basics or not.  So, as far as I can tell, it seems like you are in agreement with me.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "rtAlC5J1U40", "cid": "Ugj8O404ZvbVs3gCoAEC.8Rq7n49ciCb8THq9LQ4oz8", "comment": "I think it's because world mythology is simpler and doesn't require you to have watched all the other videos to understand. I love mythology personally so I'm not dissing it or anything, but I don't have to think hard; they're just fun, entertaining, often weird, relatable stories. Compare this to the CS videos where I often have to go back to several sections and listen again to make sure I understand the concepts properly, so it takes more effort to watch.
