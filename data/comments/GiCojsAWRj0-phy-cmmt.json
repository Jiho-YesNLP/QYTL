Is your child having difficulty in math and physics, or worse flunked a subject? Then, that's your fault as a parent.   There's no valid reason anymore for students to flunk math, chemistry and physics!!! As parents, your obligation is to share these links to them.   Do you have children or relatives or friends in grade 7, 8\u00a0 9, 10, 11, 12 or 1st year & 2nd year college, all the way to 5th year? No reason they will flunk anymore.   I was an engineering professor before, and I tell you these videos are the best preparation any high school or college student could have.   (If you're a teacher, share this with students and your class will improve immediately!!)   You don't need a teacher or a tutor anymore. These videos will guide your student into becoming a Summa Cum Laude.   Why? Because if you can understand math and physics, you can understand any topic such as political science or business management easily. Therefore, Summa Cum Laude.   Let them watch these videos in advance, and repeat over and over again.    Here are links to videos that will make them number 1 in the classroom for chemistry, math,\u00a0 & physics   Note: These are YouTube Playlists, meaning, each link has many videos in each; some with 300 videos per link.

Math, in any topic, finds its roots in problem solving. Problem solving exists in things like puzzles, and other types of activities requiring critical thinking. Some people find pleasure and satisfaction in being able to come to solutions about various different types of problem solving, and math is no exception.   School forcing people to learn at a controlled pace, and having good grades are one of the reasons why people might be turned away from something like mathematics, but there is no denying that there is still a very heavy satisfaction in being able to find solutions to math problems in general. It's something people can find a lot of passion in doing (like myself), and can actually be a nice passion project.   It's understandable if you don't feel the same way, but that's the general idea behind why someone can find it fun.

I would say, you can take a textbook from Sullivan (every edition), and try to solve some of the calculus problems there, if you want. There is a chapter 8, which I do found hightly interesting.

I also can remember, that I was very fast exactly in those topics. However, if you study high mathematics at the university you have to have high motivation and strong nerves, I believe.  For me mathematics is just an intellectual hobby. It may sound stupid, but it is so.  The book by Sullivan is called College Algebra (some of the questions there are really difficult). So, if you are really interested, I would recommend it. It is also printed in Chicago, as I have heard one of the Top Universities in the US.  P.S. Book by Sullivan is only an introduction in the higher mathematics for the whole spectrum of jobs.

You can imagine each tree taking up a certain amount of space (15m) each, meaning each tree will take up 15m of the total distance. So you get 600m/15m=40 trees. Or you can imagine it as an algebraic function that you can rearrange. For example, (total distance) = (number of trees) x (distance between trees).
