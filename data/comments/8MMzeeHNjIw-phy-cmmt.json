To understand what is going on, one needs to start at the beginning, namely from the voltages at the two ends of a resistor, of an inductor (coil), and of a capacitor. Without understanding how the electrical current (traversing that component) and the voltage (between the two ends of that component) are related, one cannot understand why the vector sum works, whereas the linear combination fails. The video starts from a formula for the total impedance and... seems to ascertain the validity of the vector sum for the electrical currents. In reality, one starts the other way 'round: from the electrical currents, convincing oneself that the vector sum needs to be applied, and determining the total impedance of the circuit. In any case, a formula is given for the electrical currents flowing through the three components and the total electrical current (around 7:50). Not surprisingly (to me), the tutor fails to address the question: what exactly are these bloody electrical currents? A physicist needs to start from the definitions (whereas, for many non-physicists/mathematicians, definitions appear to be a waste of time). It so happens that the electrical currents discussed in the video are NOT the INSTANTANEOUS electrical currents (obtained when one \"freezes time\" and \"measures\" the relevant values). The INSTANTANEOUS electrical currents ALWAYS fulfil the condition \"Total electrical current is equal to the sum of electrical currents flowing through the three legs\" or I(t)=I1(t)+I2(t)+I3(t). If this condition is violated, then electrical charge is created or destroyed at some nodes, which is, of course, utter nonsense. Treated in the video are the AMPLITUDES of the electrical currents, not their INSTANTANEOUS values. And, in order to understand that, one needs to understand first the PHASE DIFFERENCE between the currents I1, I2, and I3.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "Ugzmy9Qhn_NEeFbKSnN4AaABAg", "comment": "in parallel ckt net impedence is always less than the minimum among all components individual impedences. but you got 36 as net impedence when an element having 30 impedence i spresent already there answer should be less than 30.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "Ugw7kix0jLZmWnn_wyB4AaABAg.9uonEcJ3ZL-A1B5QXeLkXC", "comment": "All the best bro, I'm also from chilomoni", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgyEBx-ZAy9I0bmPY6l4AaABAg.9mBiZha8L819mFFD9RcCRW", "comment": "\u00a0@fighter1342\u00a0  is it the one for it's wave function?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgyEBx-ZAy9I0bmPY6l4AaABAg.9mBiZha8L819mFI3bb-o9G", "comment": "\u00a0@fighter1342\u00a0 I don't actually get what you wrote tho but maybe u can chat me on somewhere else ,where u can send image and I understand wat u wrote down", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgwxrBG7rbWUhTQIE_94AaABAg", "comment": "How is the formula for resonant frequency same as that of series rlc. circuit?", "votes": "3", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgxQxKwpDqvxoZGrfQ14AaABAg", "comment": "Nice", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgzNhZ3aRVJu-PgFDf54AaABAg", "comment": "I assume both equations here for Zs and Is wouldn\u2019t work for a circuit with Resistor, dirty coils and a pure capacitor?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgzBJyBkFJWGbicap454AaABAg", "comment": "Why u dont use index number?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgzodwY4kMk1Xrbpr_R4AaABAg", "comment": "In the beginning for impedance your math is wrong at the end.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgwwnFkObUVFMljnb-94AaABAg", "comment": "why is he not using complex numbers for the impedances?

In this case, when using a current/impedance/power triangle to solve for unknowns, j will equal the total reactance for said triangle. (I through L or C for current triangle, remaining/total reactance for the impedance triangle, and VARs total for power triangle) So if you have 60 ohms XL and 30 ohms XC, your total or X is 30 ohms and it is considered more inductive. With these values, and the use of an impedance triangle, AND a calculator capable of imaginary numbers functions, you can plug in 30 (for your 'real' ohms, the resistance) + 30 j (for the 30 remaining 'imaginary' ohms, this would be - for a circuit that is more capacitive) and the result, if you are in polar form (r theta appears in top left on my calculator) will be your hypotenuse for this triangle, which is Z or total impedance. You can then use another function on the calculator to give you the angle for this triangle, and that angle will be the SAME for all three triangles, greatly simplifying the rest of the calculations. (the angle will also be - if the circuit is more capacitive)  I hope this helps someone, because complex numbers make a lot of these calculations very trivial.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgwDu82PWQVqCYs5Ut14AaABAg.92SgBFkMCsM9PGNcBJg6aC", "comment": "How I understood, the complex state variable method is a solution to your problem:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9Ew2LXPsWI", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgwDu82PWQVqCYs5Ut14AaABAg.92SgBFkMCsM9UKTpXpohIp", "comment": "it's literally just Pythagoras' theorem", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "UgxyfD-XyWre-be031R4AaABAg.91FvDw4EJ3h91FvFLWj9Mx", "comment": "I am done with the exams though", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "8MMzeeHNjIw", "cid": "Ugxj1AVFsckHsaaq8R54AaABAg.91D1S9W0w4092ZLyrPOOJG", "comment": "whats the Il + Ic ?
