Also questioned the 2 balls hitting the same ground and remember testing this with throwing and dropping a tennis balls out of an elevated window at the same time (makes it easier to see/ hear them hit as same time)  Think the key is that the thrown ball has to be thrown at from the same height as the ball you drop simultaneous with it.  If you throw the ball up in any way/ or down,  you change this and the balls would not hit at same time.  This would explain why we can ignore the horizontal motion/ velocity etc and gravity constant would be only thing that would be acting on the balls (in a vacuum)    Wonder how this in a simplistic way would explain objects moving at a high speed (near speed of light) or \"falling\" in orbit around curved space time around planets, suns etc and even the effect on time, but that is another lesson, and I need to brush up on my Newtonian physics first hahaha.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w3BhzYI6zXU", "cid": "UggJPdNv8eorpHgCoAEC", "comment": "Dr. Shini Somara is the perfect woman.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w3BhzYI6zXU", "cid": "UghdZ7c4sxDVTngCoAEC", "comment": "math please", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w3BhzYI6zXU", "cid": "UgjtIa1F63CSDHgCoAEC", "comment": "your soo cool <3", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w3BhzYI6zXU", "cid": "UggGE1D_zdme33gCoAEC", "comment": "0-39 Really???

It feels like you are trying to take the entire content from a 50 minute lecture from a traditional physics course and squish it all into a 10 minute video.  You will end up with better videos if you instead spend your 10 minutes on exploring one interesting idea/aspect of physics at a time.  Slow down and don't try to include everything.    3) One option: have some videos be conceptual videos where you present ideas, and other videos be application videos where you work out example problems.    4) You are going too fast with the math for me to follow you (and I'm a physics professor).  I can't read the equations and understand the commentary before it disappears.  So either I don't worry about understanding it or I have to pause/rewind the video (either way this means something is wrong with the video).  You need to make a difficult choice: either go conceptual and don't emphasize the math OR dedicate the time and screen space with the math so that people can follow you.  As it is, you are choosing the worst of both worlds by giving a mathematical presentation but not giving people enough time to absorb it.   5) Don't expect people to automatically memorize numbers.

From this fact you can find the exact transformation law of a vector under such a change of coordinate system.

For part a, we know that the initial velocity is 120 ft/sec, the initial position is 0 ft above the ground (we're just gonna assume that the ball was thrown straight up into the air so that there is only one dimension to contend with: the vertical axis), and the displacement (x - x initial) is 216 ft. We know that the displacement is 216 feet because x = 216 and x initial = 0, so 216 - 0 = 216 ft. We also take for granted that the acceleration of the ball is - 9.81 m/s^2, since gravity pulls the ball downwards as it flies upwards, but we have to convert it into ft/s^2, which is something I neglected to do when I first solved this problem (As an aside, screw the English measuring system. Why would we ever use the English system of measurement in any scientific discipline?) Plug all of these values into the displacement curve equation (x-x initial = v0*t + 1/2*a*t^2).  216 ft = (120 ft/sec)t + 1/2(-32.19ft/s^2)t^2  Now, we have to solve for t. This may seem like a dead end at first, but consider the fact that the ball will fly upwards, reach a certain point, then fall downwards. In other words, it will make a parabola (on the position/time graph, the real life ball will go up and down in a straight line because, as I said earlier, we're only working in one dimension), so the final equation must be a quadratic equation. Subtract the 216 ft from both sides, simplify, and you're left with  (-16.1 ft/s^2)t^2 + (120 ft/s)t - 216 ft = 0  Finally, when you put this information into the quadratic formula, you'll find that you have two valid answers: 3.04 seconds and 4.41 seconds. The first value tells you when the ball will reach 216 ft as it ascends, but the second value is just as correct as the first because it tells you when the ball will reach 216 ft as it descends. However, Cyberxxx cyberxxx was probably looking for the first value specifically.   To answer part b, we'll just take the information we have from part a and apply it again. When the ball reaches a velocity of 0 ft/s, it will stop ascending. Therefore, this could be considered the ball's maximum height (or local maximum for any calculus fans out there). If we know the ball's maximum height, we will automatically know whether or not the ball surpassed the 900 ft mark. We'll simply plug the values we need into the definition of acceleration equation ( v = v initial + at), and we get  0 ft/s = (120 ft/s) + (-32.19 ft/s^2)t  Solve for t, and we see that t = 3.73 seconds. Plug that into the displacement curve equation because we are trying to find the displacement of the ball at that time.  displacement = (120 ft/s)(3.73 s) + 1/2(-32.19 ft/s^2)(3.73 s)^2  After that, all you have to do is solve the equation, realize that x initial is still 0 ft, and conclude that the displacement is equal to the maximum height of the ball: about 224 ft. So the ball definitely isn't going to reach 900 ft.

Sounds really ambitious, to put even the basics of physics into such a few episodes. You have to cover nearly 1 chapter of the Tipler per episode. Don't think that that's going to work. E.g. you really can't do the Maxwell equations in just one episode.

I can understand why you wouldn't've recognized it, though, because you're getting into the true nuanced difference between the two, here. The ball that was thrown does have a longer distance to travel before it hits the ground, but its speed is also higher than the ball that was dropped. Also, the thrown ball's velocity vector is pointed in a different direction, a direction that causes its downward component to match the dropped ball's downward component.

(as motion is not linear, we cannot directly use the kinematic(linear motion) equations)  secondly, newton's second law states a body at rest or in motion at constant velocity in a straight line will stay at rest or in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force so, the horizontally moving ball should move horizontally, and the stationary ball should stay stationary. however, gravity is a thing, and it just so happens to be acting at full force upon the balls, causing acceleration = g, downwards. as the stationary ball accelerates downward, the distance between it and the ground decrease until it hits the ground. let's call the distance traveled, h, and the time it takes, t now, the horizontally moving ball will never hit the ground, nor run away from the ground unless a force acts. and gravity does act, moving the ball downward. as the initial movement isn't helping or hindering the ball getting to the ground, the ball still needs to cover distance h using acceleration g, and goodness!, that's time t. unless you fling the ball off a cliff, but then h is different, or if you through the ball downward, as then the ball will hit the ground without acceleration, or through it upward, so the distance covered will begin to increase  hope this helps, if the 21 lines or so of wibbly wobbly  doesn't make sense, come back after they go through Newton's Laws. between them, a=dv/dt, v=dx/dt, and the energy stuff, motion is covered. i understand why the math is so important, and why they are trying to cram secondary level math into the course, but i think that they can miss the beauty of a subject that flows naturally from these things.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "w3BhzYI6zXU", "cid": "UggK4uOKJnT5P3gCoAEC.8Cx77u8I5gG8Cy9ZIM-nus", "comment": "+randomdogdog What some are saying about the horizontal speed making a distance in the time to reach the ground is technically true but for low velocities and short distances these effects are largely insignificant and it can be modelled as if it is just gravitational freefall with the ground as a flat surface.
