Also, within a single language, modifiers you talked about, do indeed produce different behavior.  The finer details are a long story, even though I will attempt to address your questions further down below. It is an art to put the general story in a 10 minute movie, which I feel Crash Course have done a pretty good job at.

You were correct about that.  You also suggested, that a final variable should also always be static, but that is not the case. A final, non-static variable is useful, in that each object does get its own copy of the variable, but it can only be initialized once in the constructor. So each object can indeed hold a different value for that variable, but it cannot be changed as long as the object lives. It is more of a data protection feature rather than a memory addressing feature.  Now the difference between static an non-static functions. Static functions operate on the static variables and cannot access the 'instance' variables. There is only one copy of the function, and it only accesses the one copy of the static variables. Non-static functions can access both static variables and instance variables. Static variables will be accessed directly at the single memory location, while instance members are accessed by first hopping to the memory location where the object resides and then go to the relative position where the variable resides. The memory location of the object is passed to the instance function as a hidden parameter, called the 'this' argument. You cannot see it in the higher level language, but under the hood, it's there!  Further details are left out of the story above, since the compiler of the higher level language, Java in your case, will not always work directly with that memory, but will strategically make temporary copies of those values in faster pieces or memory, making the question 'what does this variable look like memory-wise' a harder question to answer.

For those of you looking to get into software engineering, stop getting so hooked up on ideological debates, language debates or buzz-terms. I don't care if you bought a book that teaches you how to answer 150 programming interview questions that you won't be asked! I'm not going to hire you if you can't demonstrate ability to problem solve and deliver a product. Engineering is all about solving problems that someone else hasn't solved yet, it's about learning how to make the code do what you want it to do, with some opportunity to refactor and improve along the way. I look at code I wrote 5 years ago and I think most of it's ridiculously ammature, and yet 5 years ago I was still a senior software developer making over 120k because I was able to solve problems.

My guess is that this series has probably attracted the academic computer scientists (the types that don't much care for electronic computers much like Edsger Dijkstra) that would rather discuss the merits of specific programming language characteristics than programmers or software engineers that would simply pick up the languages and use them to solve problems.

However, after that it just goes way off course by talking about how real software developers work, which is interesting, but IMO belongs in a final 'nice to have' episode than a mid-series episode on CS.

I feel it to be inconvenient because I code on two monitors, so I have one monitor with code execution (command line), and one with atom. Additionally, I don't like it underlining errors it is distracting while I'm coding. Most of the things it highlights are syntax errors which will come up as soon as I attempt to compile the code.  Also, IDEs can be too slow if you access them through SSH. I once attended a programming competition where they required use of Eclipse or Netbeans, and computers were dummy terminals accessing the programs from a central server. It was bad enough that there was a 5 second delay before anything you typed would show up. That competition doesn't allow anything other than nano/vim/vi/emacs anymore.  Beyond that, I hate when IDEs required stupid \"package\" things. It is really inconvenient when you are trying to use version control (like Git) to collaborate with others.
