The graph shows a plot of vapor pressure vs temperature for a single substance.  I provided it simply to give a more thorough definition of boiling point as the boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric temperature.  But note that it is just temperature that is plotted on the x-axis, not the boiling temperature.  While we can deduce the boiling temperature from the graph, the x-axis is just temperature.  The key though is that this graph just shows a single substance.  If I were to plot the vapor pressure curves of multiple substances on the same plot, what you would see is that substances with lower IMFs would be left-shifted on the graph, and substances with higher IMFs would be right-shifted.  There is a great plot demonstrating precisely this about half way down the page at the following link:https://wisc.pb.unizin.org/minimisgenchem/chapter/vapor-pressure-m10q3/ It plots the vapor pressure curves for 4 different substances.  The one with the highest IMFs (ethylene glycol) has its curve furthest right from which you would determine it has the highest boiling point of the 4 substances.
