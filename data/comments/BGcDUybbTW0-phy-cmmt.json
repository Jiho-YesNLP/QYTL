I first found your channel two years ago in my freshman year of highschool. I don't remember which video it was but I do remember that the result of watching that first video was a perfect understanding of the topic that led to me getting an 100 on the test I then took. Not long after, I once again found myself googling how to do another equation of this or that in chemistry and I once again achieved clarity from your channel. Since then, whenever I am struggling with a topic in chem, bio, physics or math, this is always the first channel I look for. Like Saul khan before you I thank you for your commitment to these videos that help so many people. This channel is a testament to how useful the internet can be as a tool for education and I thank you for helping to forward this idea. If you read this, I really, really want to thank you from the deepest depths of my heart.
