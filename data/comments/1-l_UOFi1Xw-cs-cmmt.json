Actually i have basic knowledge of all the concepts. When i am taking coding questions, i am stuck with representation of  converting problem into coding representation. i can think of my solution. but i start to write code. i am stuck with how we represent the problem as array or make list of some classes with properties like that. can u help me to resolve this.\r \r Please find the problem and i started to solve this problem. where i am making mistakes.    \r \r Merging bubbles\r Alice is playing with bubbles. She is standing at point (0, 0) and has created N bubbles. Each bubble can be characterized by there parameters:\r \r v: denoting the size of the bubble\r x: denoting the x coordinate of the bubble\r y: denoting the y coordinate of the bubble\r The following process will take place as long as there are two or more bubbles left:\r \r Alice will choose the bubble closest to her (in case there are multiple options for a bubble she will choose the largest one among them). (Note: Here distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to \r After choosing the first bubble, similarly, she will choose the second bubble from the bubbles left.\r Let the two bubbles chosen have parameters as [ v1, x1, y1 ] (first bubble) and [ v2, x2, y2 ] (second bubble) respectively .\r She will merge the two bubbles chosen and a new bubble with parameters [ v1+v2, x1 - x2, y1 - y2 ] will be formed.\r You are given array Arr containing the characteristics of the N bubbles.\r \r Task\r \r Determine the coordinates of the last bubble left after the process ends.\r \r Notes\r \r Assume 1-based indexing.\r There could be multiple bubbles at the same point.\r Explanation\r \r Assumptions\r \r N = 4\r Arr = [ [9,1,0] , [4,9,0] , [12,0,1], [15,4,0] ]\r Approach\r \r There are two bubbles closest to Alice: [9, 1, 0] and [12, 0, 1] and among these the larger bubble (i.e [12, 0, 1] ) is choosen as the first bubble, So [9, 1, 0] will be choosen as the second bubble. The new bubble formed after merging these two bubbles is [21, -1, 1]. The new array of bubbles will be [ [4, 9, 0] , [15, 4, 0] , [21, -1, 1] ].\r Now, the bubbles [21, -1, 1] and [15, 4, 0] will be chosen and the new resulting bubble will be [36, -5, 1].\r Finally, bubbles [36, -5, 1] and [4, 9, 0] are chosen and the new bubble formed will be [40, -14, 1].\r Now there is only one bubble left at coordinates (-14, 1) and this is the answer.\r Function description\r \r Complete the function solve provided in the editor. This function takes the following 2 parameters and returns the required answer:\r \r N: Represents the size of array Arr\r Arr: Represents the elements of array Arr\r Input format\r \r Note: This is the input format that you must use to provide custom input (available above the Compile and Test button).\r \r The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. T also specifies the number of times you have to run the solve function on a different set of inputs.\r For each test case:\r The first line contains N denoting the size of array Arr.\r Each of the next N  lines contains 3 space-separated integers. The ith line denotes the characteristics of the ith bubble: [v,x,y].\r Output format\r For each test case in a new line, print the coordinates of the last bubble.\r \r Constraints\r \r 1\u2264T\u226410\r \r 2\u2264N\u2264105\r \r 1\u2264vi\u2264105\r \r \u2212105\u2264xi,yi\u2264105\r \r \r \r Sample input 1\r \r 2\r 4\r 9 1 -0\r 4 9 0\r 12 0 1\r 15 4 0\r 4\r 2 1 0\r 3 -2 -1\r 5 3 4\r Sample output 1\r \r -14 1\r -4 -3\r \r Explanation\r The first line contains the number of test cases, T = 2.\r \r The first test case\r \r The first test case is explained in the problem statement.  \r \r The second test case\r \r Given\r \r N = 4\r Arr = [ [2, 1, 0], [3, -2, -1], [5, 3, 4], [8, 2, 2] ]\r Approach\r \r The bubble closest to Alice is [2, 1, 0] and the second closest bubble is [3, -2, -1] , after merging these two bubbles the new bubble formed will be [5, 3, 1]. Now Arr=[ [5, 3, 1], [5, 3, 4] , [8, 2, 2] ]\r Now, the bubble [8, 2, 2] is chosen as the first bubble and [5, 3, 1] as the second. The new bubble formed after merging these two bubbles will be [13, -1, 1].\r Finally, bubbles [13, -1, 1] and [5, 3, 4] are chosen as the first and second bubbles respectively. The new bubble formed after merging these two bubbles will be [18, -4, -3].\r The last bubble has coordinates (-4, -3) which is the required answer.\r \r Sample input 2\r \r 1\r 5\r 2 -4 5\r 5 3 -2\r 2 -2 0\r 2 0 -0\r 2 -5 2\r Sample output 2\r \r 8 -5\r Sample input 3\r \r 1\r 5\r 1 -5 3\r 3 2 -2\r 4 -1 0\r 4 5 -1\r 3 -3 3\r Sample output 3\r \r 0 -3\r  \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r My approach \r \r public class MergingBubble\r {\r public int FindLastBubble()\r {\r var totalNoofTestCases = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());\r for(int i=0;i<totalNoofTestCases;i++)\r {\r     var sizeOfArray = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());\r     List<Parameters> bubblesList = new List<Parameters>();\r \r     for(int j=0;j<sizeOfArray;j++)\r     {\r         var readBubblePoints =Console.ReadLine();\r         var SplitPoints = readBubblePoints.split(' ');\r \r         var bubbleParameters = new Parameters(SplitPoints[0],SplitPoints[1],SplitPoints[2]);\r \r         bubblesList.Add(bubbleParameters);\r \r     }\r \r     int MinDistance =-1; int x1,x2,y1,y2=0;\r \r     for( int k=0;k<bubblesList.Length-1;k++)\r     {\r         int distancebtTwoPoints = Math.Sqrt(Math.Square(bubblesList[k].x)-bubblesList[k+1].x) + Math.Square(bubblesList[k].y-bubblesList[k+1].y);\r \r         if(MinDistance ==0)\r         MinDistance =distancebtTwoPoints;\r         else if( MinDistance > distancebtTwoPoints)\r          {\r                MinDistance = distancebtTwoPoints;\r                x1 = bubblesList[k].x;\r                x2 = bubblesList[k+1].x;\r                y1 = bubblesList[k].y;\r                y2 = bubblesList[k+1].y;\r          }\r          \r          \r \r     }\r \r \r \r \r }\r }\r }\r \r public class Parameters\r {\r     public int Value{get;set;}\r     public int X{get;set;}\r     public int Y{get;set;}\r     public bool isFlagged {get;set;}\r \r     public Parameters(int v,int x, int y)\r     {\r         Value =v;\r         X=x;\r         Y=y;\r     }\r }", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1-l_UOFi1Xw", "cid": "UgyiBlZNwMcj-Gas7xx4AaABAg", "comment": "3:30 how can one differentiate this from a linked list?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1-l_UOFi1Xw", "cid": "Ugzuo02U8egN-pDAw9h4AaABAg", "comment": "I was literally about to drop this class and switch my major, but because of you I finally understand computer science.
