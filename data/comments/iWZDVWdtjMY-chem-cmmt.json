That bit of information is needed here, I did some research on google but I wasn't able to find the heat capacity of the type of ball mentioned here. Now we can assume most internal energy is kinetic, at least if we're not too close to 0K. If you have the heat capacity c you can multiply that with T(say 293K, room temperature) and that would give you a rough estimate of the internal energy.  When we have that we can assume that's the kinetic energy of all the molecules moving around in that ball, when we have the kin energy we can calculate the momentum using E = p\u00b2/2m and with that we can of course calculate the wavelength. In this case im not able to give an exact awnser/good approximiation because of lack of info about the ball's heat capacity, but it's still a lot of orders of magnitude above planck's constant. And we should not forget the heat capacity itself depends on temperature, it's only approximiately lineair on temperatures in every day life, so depending on how accurate you want an awnser it can get very tricky.  \u00a0And about that 0K story, no this hasn't been shown. The reason is no one has ever come close enough to 0K for these effects to get significant, im not going to calculate that now but you would have to get incredibly close to 0K for those effects, orders of magnitude closer than what today's technology can do. However you could get those effects with intermediate objects like large molecules that as a whole may not be really behaving quantummechanically at normal temperatures but can experimentally be cooled to sufficiently cold temperatures. So within the technological limits this has been proven\u00a0experimentally. Hope this helps you further, and in any case you could even experimentally determine the heat capacity of a given ball if needed :p  \u00a0EDIT: something went wrong when I applied this to a piece of iron of 1 kg. The value for the momentum of a (macroscopically) stationairy piece of iron get's too high, even higher than what it should be at low speeds. Probably my assumption on the composition of internal energy is wrong, if most of the energy isn't kinetic the above description doesn't work.
