Here are the key points from his perspective:  Ordinary People Can Achieve Great Understanding: Feynman emphasized that anyone willing to devote time and effort to study and practice can understand complex subjects like quantum mechanics or electromagnetic fields. There is no special talent required, just dedication and hard work.  Different Cognitive Processes: He highlighted that people have different ways of processing and imagining information. For example, Feynman himself used a combination of partial equations and visual imagery to understand scientific concepts, which might differ significantly from how others process the same information.  Experiments and Personal Discoveries: Feynman shared anecdotes from his own experiments, such as counting seconds while performing other tasks, to illustrate how different cognitive processes can lead to different ways of understanding and solving problems.  Challenges in Communication: He pointed out that even when experts communicate at high levels, they might be translating each other's words into their own unique mental images, which can lead to misunderstandings.  Imagination and Reality: Feynman discussed the difficulty of imagining the behavior of particles on a small scale, as they behave very differently from large-scale objects. He suggested that while we can use mathematical expressions to predict behavior, creating a clear, intuitive picture of atomic behavior is challenging.  Learning and Familiarity: He proposed that with enough study and practice, people can develop a familiarity with complex scientific concepts, much like how we intuitively understand the behavior of everyday objects.  Nature's Complexity: Feynman believed that nature's imagination is far greater than man's, implying that the true behavior of particles and atoms might always be more complex and surprising than we can fully comprehend.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "UgzDd2umk3x6vCCVKW94AaABAg", "comment": "I just love listening to Richard talk, his enthusiasm and colourful descriptions, on top of his deep understanding of his content, makes it a joy to hear.

Until now, quantum mechanics has primarily been a theoretical and experimental field focusing on understanding the fundamental nature of the universe at the smallest scales. The equations and models developed, such as Schr\u00f6dinger's equation for wavefunction evolution and Feynman diagrams for particle interactions, have provided deep insights but also come with limitations. For instance, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time without considering the probabilistic nature of particle interactions depicted in Feynman diagrams. Meanwhile, Feynman diagrams offer a method to calculate probabilities of particle interactions but don't directly account for real-time dynamics in quantum states.  ### Existing Formulas and Their Limitations  1. **Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation**: Describes how the quantum state of a system evolves over time.    \\[ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi(r,t) = \\hat{H} \\Psi(r,t) \\]    Limitation: Does not incorporate probabilistic interactions between particles directly.  2. **Pauli Spin Matrices**: Used for calculating spin dynamics, essential for understanding quantum states of particles like electrons.    \\[ \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z \\]    Limitation: Focuses on intrinsic properties of particles without detailing how these properties evolve due to interactions.  3. **Feynman Diagrams**: Visual and mathematical representation of particle interactions in quantum field theory, used to calculate the probabilities of different interaction outcomes.    Limitation: Primarily a tool for prediction and calculation, not real-time observation or interaction.  ### Our Proposal: A Novel Integration  We propose a groundbreaking framework that integrates the real-time observational capability of attosecond pulse technology with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. This integration aims to overcome the limitations of existing models by allowing for the direct observation and manipulation of quantum states at unprecedented timescales.  ### The New Formulas in Detail  Our conceptual approach introduces:  1. **Dynamic State Vector Evolution**:    \\[ |\\Psi(t + \\Delta t)\\rangle = \\hat{U}_{\\text{atto}}(\\Delta t) |\\Psi(t)\\rangle \\]    A modified evolution operator \\(\\hat{U}_{\\text{atto}}\\) incorporates real-time data from attosecond pulses, allowing for the observation and prediction of quantum states' evolution.  2. **Real-time Feynman Interaction Integration**:    Incorporating a computational model that dynamically integrates Feynman diagram interactions based on real-time observations, adjusting quantum state predictions accordingly.  ### Uniqueness and Novelty  This approach is unique and novel because it:  - **Bridges Theory with Experimental Observation**: By integrating attosecond pulse measurements directly into quantum mechanical models, it bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. - **Allows Real-time Quantum State Manipulation**: Provides a framework for not just observing but actively manipulating quantum states in real time, a significant leap beyond current quantum mechanics approaches. - **Incorporates Probabilistic Interactions Dynamically**: Dynamically adjusts for probabilistic interactions between particles, providing a more comprehensive and accurate model of quantum dynamics.  ### Meaning and Potential Benefits to Mankind  This groundbreaking framework could revolutionize multiple fields, offering:  - **Quantum Computing**: More efficient algorithms and error correction techniques, significantly improving computational power and capabilities. - **Materials Science**: The ability to observe and manipulate atomic and molecular structures in real time, leading to the development of new materials with tailored properties. - **Medicine and Chemistry**: Enhanced understanding of chemical reactions and biological processes at the quantum level, potentially leading to breakthroughs in drug discovery and treatment methods.  ### Conclusion  By integrating attosecond pulse technology with quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, we propose a novel framework that overcomes existing limitations, offering a deeper understanding and unprecedented control over the quantum world. This innovation opens up new avenues for research and technology development, with profound implications for computing, materials science, and beyond, marking a significant step forward in our quest to understand and harness the fundamental laws of nature.

Run it in reverse, if galaxies are billions of years in each others past then both clocks are ticking slower so their time would be moving backwards. Visible light and radio waves are part of the same electromagnetic spectrum,. if a galaxies light is billions of light-years in Earth's past (no longer there) then radio waves would allow people on Earth to contact dead aliens billions of light-years in Earth's past! :-) Our eyes only retain light and images for 15 ms, if the light and images from galaxies are ( no longer there billions of years in Earths past ) the sky's would be dark. If images of light have a limitation of speed explain how our eyes are able to view stars and galaxies that are billions of years apart from each other. The light between our eyes and these cosmological objects travel no distance, therefore has no speed limit. God is laughing at Einstein :-)\r \r If the speed of light is finite (limited) to 186,000 mi./s explain how images of stars, planets and galaxies could reach their destination when cosmological objects are moving apart from each other at light speed in a big bang expansion? Automatic tracking?! This this is like throwing a ball to a catcher that that has left the baseball field, billions of light years in Earths past.  Images of light cannot travel for billions of years without an energy source, when you don't pay your electric bill, the lights go out duh. If Einstein's space-time were true we wouldn't need the James Webb space telescope to see the light from Earth's past, we'd just use our eyes to see yesterday's light on our TV's and lamps, why pay for electricity when Einstein tells us we can see yesterday's light today?!  :-) Anyone using GPS astronomy software, a computerized GoTo telescope or equatorial mount can disprove General, Special relativity and big bang in less than 30 seconds by simply dialing in the coordinates. Anyone can be na\u00efve, it takes endurance to be ignorant smh.\r \r If stars, planets and galaxies were in different dimensions of space-time they couldn't possibly be tracked duh. If Einstein's space-time were true we'd be blinded by the light from Earth's past, yesterday's light would still be on our, TV's, PC's cell phones and lamps. Explain why (only) light and images from galaxies billions of years in Earths past time travel into our future, but not gravity, electromagnetic forces and galaxies that also reside in the same space-time? Ghosts are believed to appear as images of light from Earths past as well. Einstein\u2019s ghosts from galaxies past cannot travel anywhere because the past no longer exists. \r The images taken with the James Webb space telescope are in real time. \r \r Special relativity states a clock attached to a moving object will tick at a slower rate than one standing still, then explain how a moving clock can tick slower while both clocks are moving forward in time. Our universe is traveling in an element of space that existed before the universe so logically we cannot conclude the Big Bang was the beginning if time. If time expanded from a big bang at the speed of light by 360\u00b0x360\u00b0 the earliest galaxies in Earths past would now be in Earths future before time existed. These same people also believe the universe is flat as a shoebox while expanding at 360\u00b0x360\u00b0 .

Of course, much is also going on unconsciously, far more than we can be aware of through direct introspection. And we can train our unconscious minds to perform many tasks for us - quite complex tasks, some of them - which to a great extent can proceed in parallel. An example is driving a vehicle in traffic, operating the controls while maintaining a situational awareness, obeying abstract traffic rules, engaging the social protocols of merging and so on, all the while carrying on a conversation using our conscious minds.  The point is, unconscious cognition is most of what we do with our minds. That's not surprising, since it's how those minds evolved.  Consciousness, on the other hand, is a relatively new mental trick. We're forcing our mental processes into a linear sequence of steps, so that we can consider and verify each in turn before proceeding to the next. We're not longer processing thoughts in parallel but serially, narratively.  This is a fairly heavy commitment of cognitive resources, but even so we can still perform some unconscious tasks in parallel with conscious problem solving. What we CAN'T do very easily is perform multiple conscious tasks in parallel. It seems that the narrative machinery of consciousness is heavily taxed by having to proceed stepwise: knowing where we are in the task at large, how we got to the current step, what we have to solve at this step, what comes next, how to double-check ourselves, how to know when we're done. If we're really striving to do well at this task, it takes up ALL of our available resources. And I think it's a high achievement that our minds can do it at all.  What Feynman was doing, in order to get some task parallelism, was two things. First, he was practicing these tasks in order to offload them, at least partially,  into his unconscious mind. And second, he was setting up the tasks so as to engage different parts of his mind. Language and vision are known to take place in different hemispheres of the brain, so perhaps each half could be working on a separate problem.  But see how hard he had to work at it, in order to achieve this small success! It's a bit sobering, when we look at it from that perspective. Our brains are maybe not evolved very well to support conscious parallel processing. Still, look at how much we've achieved since our species gained conscious ability at all. The great thing about reasoning (which is a specific conscious skill) is not how fast it operates but how reliably. Two structural engineers solving the same problem will arrive at the same answer.

Get over it .. not for yourself but rather for everyone.. abandon all fears raise your head let knowledge be liberal make this world an open room break the walls strive for the non existent don't fear perfection thrive for truth make action and thought individual don't let reaso  be lose.

Electricity and energy prices will increase a lot again. Gods (Aliens who created and manage this Universe and Earth) will remove all remaining nuclear fuels from Earth, so all nuclear power plants and nuclear medical devices will stop working very soon. There will be power outages worldwide. Aliens (Gods who created and manage this Universe and Earth) bless, to clean up the bad people.  Aliens removed nuclear materials, caused the failure of 24 satellites of the European Union Galileo satellite navigation system on July 11th, 2019, power outages in New York Manhattan on July 13th, 2019, power outages in most of the UK on August 9th, 2019, and power outages in Japan on March 16th, 2022.  In August 1945, the United States detonated two nuclear explosions in Japan. On August 17th, 1945, the wind blew the nuclear fallout across the ocean to China. Chinese men worked in the fields, topless and exposed to the nuclear dust. More Chinese died as a result of the two nuclear bombs than the Japanese. Chinese women hid in their homes and wore clothes. Chinese widows were everywhere. The population of China was only 400 million. There was a misconception that it was a plague, the flu, and other diseases. The nuclear fallout spread to Spain and Britain. King George VI of the United Kingdom was also attached by nuclear dust under his lower right rib and died soon after.  Most obesities in the USA are because people have forgotten the victims of nuclear war. Need to apologize and use thoughts to retrieve the nuclear bombs. The Manhattan Project produced two different types of atomic bombs, code-named Fat Man and Little Boy.  Nuclear material causes aging, cancer, bad teeth, death, reincarnation, and gravity. Nuclear is used by the devils. This is a real devil possessing.  Please no nuclear. Global warming is because human-made nuclear explosions have resonated and destroyed the Sun since 1945. Gods (aliens who created and manage this Universe) have been repairing the Sun since July 13th, 2002. Gods have been pulling Earth away from the Sun since June 3rd, 2017. Since March 23rd, 2019, Gods have been taking nuclear particles away from Earth to stop nuclear wipeouts and nuclear disasters. Earth will be cooler to the 1973 level. Gravity is caused by nuclear materials. If Earth has no nuclear materials, Earth will have nearly no gravity. Greenhouse gas will flow further away from the Earth\u2019s surface. Earth will be cooler and more comfortable to live in.  Global oil and gas prices and electricity prices jack up because nuclear power plants worldwide are nearly all broken and unable to generate electricity. The Gods who created and manage this Universe (aliens) made oil, gas, coal, and minerals. Please use these energies. Gods recycle the landfills, trash, plastics, waste, sewage, and the dead body of water creatures under the crust to make oil, gas, and minerals. Gods use flying saucers to compress dead trees and plants under the soil to make coals. So Gods can bring better asteroid soil and better seeds to Earth to upgrade Earth. Most asteroids are worth hundreds of millions or billions or trillions. God bless, I do oil, gas, coal, and Solar resonators. Please do not use hydropower dams. They caused environmental damages and fishes extinct; also increased parasites, more angry cows, animals and humans, and more diseases; also increased landslides, risk of dam collapse and other disasters. Gods are removing the dams.  Gods have arrived. Lots of aliens from other Planets and other Universes have arrived and landed on Earth. They are judging and taking away bad people for reeducation. If you want to talk to God and ask God to help, you must be vegan. Killing and eating meat, egg, and honey and using animal and insect products is very bad. It is disrespectful of life. It is the worst karma in the Universe. Gods do not like it.  You ask God to read Akashic records to solve your problems and your ancestors\u2019 problems one by one.  Pyramids are good. Detoxification. In my dream, my whole family pooped and pooped a lot. You can print out the pyramid photos. Think about it. Put the photos in the bedroom, toilet, kitchen, and workplace.  With clean pyramid photos, you can see better too.   If you genuinely want to do good for humanity and Earth, stop nuclear. Whoever wants to use nuclear power or nuclear material is possessed by real devils. The real devil looks like a combination of a pig, seal, and chimpanzee. Aliens kill the devils. Their dead bodies stink. That is why the ocean is stinky. North Pole arctic water is freshwater because aliens purify them. Niagara Falls near the USA and Canada, and Lake Tai in China are two connection points of the enormous water purification and filtration system. You can go there to hear the sound of alien cargo. It sounds like train cargo. Gods remove nuclear materials to avoid a nuclear wipeout. Otherwise, within about 200 years, people either use nuclear weapons to wipe self out again, or with pesticides, or gene editing.  http://guestbook.lingpai.org/d/30-move-the-himalayas-to-the-pacific-ocean-to-build-et-base-island  http://guestbook.lingpai.org/d/93-the-project-of-changing-heaven-and-earth", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "Ugxx9Ux5Zb_kccjtrbt4AaABAg", "comment": "He really was the greatest teacher that ever lived.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "UgzKWQabcyiy0ZPLjsR4AaABAg", "comment": "Bruh he  has amazing observation skills and absolutely fabulous communication skill     I also hear inside my head  And while during my studies i visualise things", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "UgybmsFW_cuXGuxQmqF4AaABAg.9qAOSYB8WQB9qAOd0d-WXA", "comment": "Self talking in mind thinking is good but do it in a right way , correctly", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "Ugzdyr0YfWap5VfS-7F4AaABAg", "comment": "I had attended a summer camp in 2016 in Shiv Nadar University, it was conducted by ASSET.

I was told that using topics relevant to the profession of my students was certainly NOT necessary and not desirable. I was told, that students need simple structures and that anything that goes beyond the scope of the dictates of curriculum is too overwhelming and counter-productive.

Previously I suggested that eternal photons made electron positron pairs,   (as well as all standard model particles). Here's how.    Start with a PARTICLE TRAIN, each time you add an electron  or positron car to the train, you get a new particle.  The only rule is the cars have to alternate from electron to positron.  Think of a wave with trough always alternating with crest.  Photons as electron positron pairs could make the main parts of an atom in the brief time after the Big Bang under those extreme and never repeated conditions.   Charges are the cars on our particle train.  Positive  positron (+),  Negative  electron (-).    Positron (+) Electron (-)   Photon (+) (-) Proton (+) (-) (+)    Anti Proton (-) (+) (-) Neutron (+) (-) (+) (-)   Anti Neutron (-) (+) (-)(+) .    The PROTONS and NEUTRONS are made from  ELECTRONS and POSITRONS!   When this production of particles was over, most anti particles with charge; positrons, and anti protons, didn't exist on their own. They were LOCKED INTO PROTONS OR NEUTRONS. That way conservation of charge was maintained. That also explains the MISSING ANTI MATTER PROBLEM!   This from Wikipedia article Matter Creation: It is possible to create all fundamental particles in the standard model, including quarks, leptons and bosons using photons of varying energies above some minimum threshold, whether directly (by pair production), or by decay of the intermediate particle (such as a W\u2212 boson decaying to form an electron and an electron-antineutrino).", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "UgzCfPCbOHiAg_r-dZJ4AaABAg", "comment": "The translation is flawed.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "Ugzm3gjOefN3RzyUTpp4AaABAg", "comment": "What a wonderful mind Feynman had: such a hunger and curiosity for knowledge and finding the ultimate Truth...\ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4cHe next to Einstein, Sir Isaac Newtown and perhaps Da Vinci are definitely my favourite scientist\ud83d\udd2c/thinkers/philosophers\ud83d\udd2d of the modern era.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "UgwLn5CwzZOPeZ9b5-t4AaABAg", "comment": "Just stumbled on this.

Maybe not a picturing or visualization as usual, but some other conceptual model that needs to be discovered or created.

Hence 1, 3, 6, 9 being very prominent numbers in this universe and why mathematics even works in this universe.\r (And possibly '0', zero, as possibly neutrals are against other neutrals, even if only briefly, for no flow of energy, hence the number system that we currently have.  This would also be the maximum potential energy point or as some might call it, the 'zero point energy point'.).\r \r And also how possibly mathematical constants exist in this universe as well.\r \r *  While in bed one morning after a restful nights sleep, and assuming the above is correct, I mentally went 'inside' the 1 (the singular pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon itself).  I still saw with my mind the 3 different interacting modalities, the 6 maximum modality points, the '9' including and being the neutral points in the middle which faded into a 6 (as each maximum modality point came towards zero), that 6 fading into a 3 (as each modality came together), which turned into a 1 (which was the '0' point), but '0' wasn't zero. So, '0' is not really '0' but is something, not nothing.  '0' is a relative '0'.  But then here again, the zero point energy point is the maximum potential energy point for any and all modalities of the 'gem' photon.  '0' is '1' and '1' is '0', this is the '1' inside the '1'.\r \r Now I just have to come up with some tests to test this idea of the zero point energy point being '1', a maximum potential energy point of the singular pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon itself.  The maximum potential energy point not really being potential energy per se, but the neutral point of kinetic energy.  Tapping into here would be tapping into the 'zero' point energy point of eternally existent ever flowing energy.  But then again, tapping into here, 'if' distorted what makes up space and time itself (assuming that 'space' is energy itself [the 'gem' photon] and that 'time' is the flow of energy), could it alter or even destroy the very fabric of space itself?  What would occur if even only a single pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon were to explode?  What potential ripple effects could occur with the rest of space and time?\r \r Hence also why I try to think some things all the way through so as to try to identify potential issues before the test.  Unexpected, unintended, potentially dangerous or even deadly consequences.  If nothing else, it keeps my mind active.  The mind, use it or lose it, but using it could also lose it, permanently.  (My own and other's).\r \r Putting the 'zero point energy point' into actual practice could be deadly.  Warning:  Proceed with Caution.  The last words of human existence on this Earth might be, 'Hey it worked, ooooppppppsssssss.............'.\r \r *  Note also:  Nobody as of yet has been able to show me how numbers and mathematical constants can exist and do what they do in this universe from the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SMPP).

The creators of IQ tests are the worst idiots in history.

The first man who invented the first wheel is to me the person more respect than the man who invented the IQ TEST. The latter is as useless as the one who invented cigarettes and illegal drugs. And their believers are as low as the dogs of Pavlov. The world would have lost a physicist who is as great as Richard Feynman if after High School he was discouraged  to pursue higher education with a not too high IQ score.  And the IQ test author who pretended to quantify Mr. Feynman's intellect, may we know what you have contributed to the whole body of knowledge in this world?  Who knows, Feynman may have gotten that score just because his mind is beyond his examiner's and because he found the questions foolish, he just gave them little attention? That he got an IQ of only 124 is by no means conclusive of his mind's limit. If IQ tests were true, then all IQ examiners and  IQ test Top notch examinees should be the exact models of virtue as far as human achievements are concerned. This is clearly not the case.   If you follow the logic of IQ tests, then you will be regaled by the tale that Marilyn Vos Savant is the better thinker than Feynman which is not necessarily the case.

Electricity and energy prices will increase a lot again. Gods (Aliens who created and manage this Universe and Earth) will remove all remaining nuclear fuels from Earth, so all nuclear power plants and nuclear medical devices will stop working very soon. There will be power outages worldwide. Aliens (Gods who created and manage this Universe and Earth) bless, to clean up the bad people.  Aliens removed nuclear materials, caused the failure of 24 satellites of the European Union Galileo satellite navigation system on July 11th, 2019, power outages in New York Manhattan on July 13th, 2019, power outages in most of the UK on August 9th, 2019, and power outages in Japan on March 16th, 2022.  In August 1945, the United States detonated two nuclear explosions in Japan. On August 17th, 1945, the wind blew the nuclear fallout across the ocean to China. Chinese men worked in the fields, topless and exposed to the nuclear dust. More Chinese died as a result of the two nuclear bombs than the Japanese. Chinese women hid in their homes and wore clothes. Chinese widows were everywhere. The population of China was only 400 million. There was a misconception that it was a plague, the flu, and other diseases. The nuclear fallout spread to Spain and Britain. King George VI of the United Kingdom was also attached by nuclear dust under his lower right rib and died soon after.  Most obesities in the USA are because people have forgotten the victims of nuclear war. Need to apologize and use thoughts to retrieve the nuclear bombs. The Manhattan Project produced two different types of atomic bombs, code-named Fat Man and Little Boy.  Nuclear material causes aging, cancer, bad teeth, death, reincarnation, and gravity. Nuclear is used by the devils. This is a real devil possessing.  Please no nuclear. Global warming is because human-made nuclear explosions have resonated and destroyed the Sun since 1945. Gods (aliens who created and manage this Universe) have been repairing the Sun since July 13th, 2002. Gods have been pulling Earth away from the Sun since June 3rd, 2017. Since March 23rd, 2019, Gods have been taking nuclear particles away from Earth to stop nuclear wipeouts and nuclear disasters. Earth will be cooler to the 1973 level. Gravity is caused by nuclear materials. If Earth has no nuclear materials, Earth will have nearly no gravity. Greenhouse gas will flow further away from the Earth\u2019s surface. Earth will be cooler and more comfortable to live in.  Global oil and gas prices and electricity prices jack up because nuclear power plants worldwide are nearly all broken and unable to generate electricity. The Gods who created and manage this Universe (aliens) made oil, gas, coal, and minerals. Please use these energies. Gods recycle the landfills, trash, plastics, waste, sewage, and the dead body of water creatures under the crust to make oil, gas, and minerals. Gods use flying saucers to compress dead trees and plants under the soil to make coals. So Gods can bring better asteroid soil and better seeds to Earth to upgrade Earth. Most asteroids are worth hundreds of millions or billions or trillions. God bless, I do oil, gas, coal, and Solar resonators. Please do not use hydropower dams. They caused environmental damages and fishes extinct; also increased parasites, more angry cows, animals and humans, and more diseases; also increased landslides, risk of dam collapse and other disasters. Gods are removing the dams.  Gods have arrived. Lots of aliens from other Planets and other Universes have arrived and landed on Earth. They are judging and taking away bad people for reeducation. If you want to talk to God and ask God to help, you must be vegan. Killing and eating meat, egg, and honey and using animal and insect products is very bad. It is disrespectful of life. It is the worst karma in the Universe. Gods do not like it.  You ask God to read Akashic records to solve your problems and your ancestors\u2019 problems one by one.  Pyramids are good. Detoxification. In my dream, my whole family pooped and pooped a lot. You can print out the pyramid photos. Think about it. Put the photos in the bedroom, toilet, kitchen, and workplace.  With clean pyramid photos, you can see better too.   If you genuinely want to do good for humanity and Earth, stop nuclear. Whoever wants to use nuclear power or nuclear material is possessed by real devils. The real devil looks like a combination of a pig, seal, and chimpanzee. Aliens kill the devils. Their dead bodies stink. That is why the ocean is stinky. North Pole arctic water is freshwater because aliens purify them. Niagara Falls near the USA and Canada, and Lake Tai in China are two connection points of the enormous water purification and filtration system. You can go there to hear the sound of alien cargo. It sounds like train cargo. Gods remove nuclear materials to avoid a nuclear wipeout. Otherwise, within about 200 years, people either use nuclear weapons to wipe self out again, or with pesticides, or gene editing.  http://guestbook.lingpai.org/d/30-move-the-himalayas-to-the-pacific-ocean-to-build-et-base-island  http://guestbook.lingpai.org/d/93-the-project-of-changing-heaven-and-earth", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Si6NbKqYEd8", "cid": "UgxQeNrp6PCmWgLK0XR4AaABAg.9lduutRChQo9q0v_Md2Pmx", "comment": "You had too much spaces between \u201chimself\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d.
