This problem was solved last century. If the room wasn't designed properly, does not have sound treatments, then they have hardware that automatically controls the audio signals, or a  limiter if you want to use a sledge hammer, or a compressor in a pinch, or the old best option still works: an EQ can be used to cut out the frequencies that are feeding back into the Professors microphone in that room. Getting it right matters. Just ask Boeing in 2024.  Feedback is distracting, does not facilitate learning, and is a problem. The AV depatment can fix this problem with any number of solutions.

Hormones and body conditions affect brain functioning.  Hormones and body conditions can have a significant impact on brain functioning, leading to abnormal behavior. These factors can be used in legal cases, with the Twinkie defense being an example. Understanding the relationship between thoughts, emotions, memories, and physiology is crucial in grasping complex social behavior.  2. Categorization simplifies understanding yet can oversimplify.  Categorization helps us understand complex things by simplifying them, but it can also lead to oversimplification and difficulty differentiating between similar things. Language plays a major role in how we perceive and categorize objects, as shown by studies on color and shape recognition. Different languages draw boundaries at different points, affecting our ability to remember words.  3. Interplay of biology and behavior is highly complex.  The video highlights the complex interplay between hormones, genes, fetal development, and evolutionary pressures in influencing behavior. A key takeaway is to avoid categorical thinking and analyze the interactions between neurons, circuitry, and sensory stimulation. This approach helps understand behavior in various contexts.  4. Behaviorism's limitations in explaining human behavior.  The failure of behaviorism to fully explain human behavior is highlighted, discussing the scandal that led John Watson out of academia. The importance of brain synapses for normal psychic life is emphasized, and extreme treatments like electric shock therapy and frontal lobotomies are explored, including their dark history.  5. Importance of multiple influences on human behavior.  It's important to critically think about human behavior, considering various influences such as genes, hormones, neurons, and environment. Three intellectual choices when approaching the biology of human social behavior are mentioned, along with Conrad Lorenz's discovery of imprinting in birds.  6. Menstrual synchronization in hamsters and humans.  Female hamsters can synchronize their ovulation cycles when housed together, and male hamsters can desynchronize and shorten the synchronization cycle of females. Similarly, women tend to synchronize their menstrual cycles with roommates during freshman year of college, likely due to olfactory cues. However, if a woman is in a close intimate relationship with a male, her cycle may desynchronize. The synchronization occurs between socially outgoing and dominating individuals.  7. Unique power of human physiology.  Humans possess a unique ability to use their physiology in remarkable ways, such as experiencing empathy and a wide range of emotions. This sets them apart from other animals and adds to the complexity of understanding human behavior.

Which results in forming boundaries that shape our narratives. Resulting in  how we perceive and what we perceive and evaluate. Categories makes it easy to remember and evaluate. But their are limitations to categorical thinking:   a) You can't differentiate between two facts that fall in same category. (Underestimate the differences)  b) And cant see similiarities even if they fall in different categories.(Overestimate the differences)  c) When you pay too much attention to boundaries you don't see the big picture.  5. Taking one step at a time backwardly explaining behaviour. There is no bucket(explanations/theory/category) only temporary platforms that helps in understanding all the influences came beforehand at that point of time.  6. One can have explanations and know theories. And still be wrong. Resist the temptation to be in a single bucket(category) and describing all the influences.   7.

Genetic mutation in one gene in the brain as a possible explanation for the man's behavior. Commonality between having periods, brain tumors, eating junk food, and taking anabolic steroids in relation to explaining the behavior of murderers. The influence of bodily processes on behavior. The complex interplay between nature and nurture in shaping behavior.  The professor presents a scenario of a man exhibiting strange behavior and disappearing after embezzling money from work. They suggest that a genetic mutation in one gene in the brain could be a possible explanation for the man's behavior. The professor also discusses the commonality between different bodily processes and how they can be used to explain the behavior of murderers in court cases. They highlight the importance of understanding the influence of bodily processes on behavior and the complex interplay between nature and nurture in shaping behavior.   The Biology of Behavior Thinking in categories and the potential problems associated with it. The goal of the class to understand how the body influences behavior, emotions, and memories. The importance of objectively describing behavior and working backwards to understand the underlying neural and hormonal mechanisms. Tracing behavior back through development, genetics, and evolution to gain a complete understanding of it.  The speaker begins by engaging the audience and introducing the concept of thinking in categories. They explain the potential problems with this kind of thinking and how it can lead to underestimating similarities and overemphasizing differences. The speaker then introduces the goal of the class to understand how the body influences behavior, emotions, and memories without relying on categorical thinking. They highlight the importance of objectively describing behavior and working backwards to understand the underlying neural and hormonal mechanisms. Finally, they explain that this analysis will continue all the way back through development, genetics, and evolution to gain a complete understanding of the behavior.

Policies that have been with us since the Sumerians some 4,000 years ago Monopoly is the parasite that forces everyone into parasitic relationships. It is traditional Warrior men that prevents a society from plummeting into dystopian tyrannical dictatorships and we can see how effective this social engineering efforts of worked so efficiently and feminizing the Inner Warrior of every male in Western Nations. Yet China has not allowed this social engineering to take place and neither has Russia. It would seem that they're masculine soldiers are more well-equipped to defend the monopolistic interests of their Elites versus our Elites who are now stuck with men who wear nylons and prints around their dresses all focused on their feelings while abandoning logic reasoning critical thinking and developing masculine skills but rather developing their feminine female feelings oriented unnatural traits. How does this end for Western Nations if the elites of the East decide to backstab the elites of the West? Because up until now all the elites of the world have been collaborating together for hundreds of years to reduce each other's human resource numbers when they're Monopoly systems fail and they're no longer able to support their populations because after all it's not the planet surface and resourcesarily that determines how many human resources can be sustained but rather the economic output of any particular community. Whether that is a community of geese squirrels Aboriginal people living in the jungle monkeys or dysfunctional sophisticated massive highly densified over capacitated cities. It is economics that determines whether or not you can exercise freedom. It is the output of your energy translated into the resources you create that allows you to dictate life on your terms and nothing else. No different than what a bird participates in its own economy by gathering raw resources turning it into a nest and allowing it the ability to propagate itself fulfill it's biological primary directive while using all of its natural adaptations to defend to the death it's nothing grounds and offspring. However humans have naturalized and normalized this idea that we have no inherent right to defend that which we believe is ours and more importantly our offspring. I don't know about all this Gene talk and directing our behaviors and attitudes but we know now that remnants of a RNA based viral material in our brains may very well be dictating our consciousness, our behaviors and attitudes, very subtle manipulation for the benefit of some virus in the future. It's not that simple and we have bacteria and fungus that also do a lot of mind control on humans and other organisms. That's a whole new Pandora's Box. And it might likely be that there is a viral element and why we lean towards Monopoly through the initiation of violence. It would seem logical that humans would prefer to cooperate rather than risk life and limb simply to abscond the resources of other people.

Aber an wahre Hilflichkeit, gibt's nur eine Loesung.   Das ist geschlechtlich; ein Rasse Sache.   Sie sind nicht von Englischer Rasse, aber sie sprechen Englisch.  Technikalisch, wir sind alle Anglisizierte Keltischen; geraeubt von geschlechtliches Anzeichen von Englischeren.  Jener Alter Aeon, es gab auch Leuten mit Deutsches Anzeichen, vielleicht anderen, in Land hier.   Allerlei theoretesche Meinungen waren gemacht, ans Verbessern- aber weil sie haben nicht mit gruendsaechliche Wahrheiten mitgehandelt, sie hatten ueberhaupt kein Wert.  Ans Verbessern, gibt's nur eine Loesung:  Sie muessen es halten, Nicht-geschlechtliche Wesendheit; sie muessen geschlechtlich werden- sie muessen am beste Englischer Sprache verlassen; am beste gezeichneter Sprache fuer Land hier ist Skottische Gaeligh, Deutsch und Irish sehr fast so gut.  Sie muessen geschlechtlich werden; ein aufgemachter Name ist Amerika, es gibt kein Geschlecht sogenannt.  Es existiert kein Amerikanischer Geschlecht.   Weil sie benuetzen Sprache was kommte aus einem anderes Geschlecht, sie habne eine Miasma; seine geschlechter Sprache ist Keltisch Albannach.  Das ist der Lands Ober Zeichung hier, jetzt.   Miasma macht sie sehr schwach, vielleicht krank.  Es gibt auch ein Fluch, an der Fanne sogemacht; sie koennen dieser Fluch nicht verlieren, ohne sie veraendern der Lands Name- an Nova Skotia oder Alba Nuadh ist am beste moeglich.  Acceptieren sie, sie sind getaeuscht und misgefuehrt- von einem falscher Prophet, persoenlich der Amerikanischer Praesident; sie sind auch geschlechtlich misgefuehrt- sie sind nicht Englisch... noch ist es moeglich, ein Englischer Mann noch Fraeulein, weil die Zeichung und Channel war voellig aus dem Welt genomment, vor sehr laenger Zeit ist das geschehen.  Sie sind dergleich mit Anglisizierte Keltischen.  Alle haben eine Zeichung, Fles oder Saxon Keltisch, in Land hier.  Um nicht Fluch noch Miasma haben, sie muessen diese Veraenderungen tun; alles Glauben an \"Amerikanischer Revolution\" verlassen; das ist ueberhaupt warum der Fanne ist immer verflucht, vieles Gewalt und Blutgiessen angewendet, ans Lands Besitzen, was brachte Perdition, fuer alle so verwickelt...", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "NNnIGh9g6fA", "cid": "Ugw4ljCjPAHy-GtfiqR4AaABAg.9hnQ-33oEbM9v9ZtbHKgDs", "comment": "Dumb and/or giddy I agree they seem high or something", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "NNnIGh9g6fA", "cid": "Ugw4ljCjPAHy-GtfiqR4AaABAg.9hnQ-33oEbM9xRngBlI4on", "comment": "This is the first class in the whole semester they\u2019re probably nervous", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "NNnIGh9g6fA", "cid": "UgyLrijBV0HuuA9eIkl4AaABAg", "comment": "Every human should listen to this entire series.
