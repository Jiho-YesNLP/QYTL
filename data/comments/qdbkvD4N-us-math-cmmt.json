Denoting the variables as f(z, t, y) you will then find, by matching terms as you did for the GMB, that f_z must be constant (hence, f_zz must be zero, and then f_z = 0 turns out to be feasible), then, you will find, using the dt term, f = exp(-\\mu t) (y + x_0) where y = \\int_0^t g(s) dB_s.

Remember your good old Black-Scholes equation? That's a PDE that governs the option price! You can definitely use finite difference method on the Black-Scholes PDE to price options. Although it's a bit silly to do so because we can often derive the closed-form pricing formula for derivatives (even some exotic ones) under the Black-Scholes model. But for some really weird path-dependent ones, this is for sure one way to go.  However, the real power of this technique lies in one observation: Even for models that are more complex than Black-Scholes, we can often write down a PDE that governs the option prices under those models. More remarkably, those PDEs are often of the same form as the Black-Scholes PDE. For example, there is a similar PDE under the Heston model, which is one of the many stochastic volatility models out there, and the channel quantpie has a video about the derivation of that PDE.  What all of this means is that you can still use finite difference method under these advanced models to price exotic derivatives, which is pretty cool imo.", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qdbkvD4N-us", "cid": "UgyHrsFRTdJ8FwS80rF4AaABAg", "comment": "Use it everyday in trading don't no how it works", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qdbkvD4N-us", "cid": "UgwcI0WVra4nWau_xR94AaABAg", "comment": "The guess part can use taylor series to explain it, but the thing of the no terms would be super confusing if he explains like this.
