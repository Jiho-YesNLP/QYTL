The short answer to your question is that the log function is basically a function that allows you to determine what the exponent term is in a certain equation where the exponent is the unknown. For example 100 = 10^x, you can use the log function to determine what x is quite easily.. Of course I gave you an easy example that you can probably do in your head. But if the equation read 12,300 = 4^x, now you'd be stumped. But if you used the log function, it would give you a quick way to solve for that.
