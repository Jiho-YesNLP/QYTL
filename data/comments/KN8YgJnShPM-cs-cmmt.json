The basic \"on/off\" states are what is usually referred to as \"binary numbers\" and are written as 0s and 1s: 10011100 11110010. As such, binary is just a number format, like decimal (base-10) or hexadecimal (base-16); binary being base-2. You can translate any number between those formats, it's just a way of writing numbers down, and computers use the binary format because that's easy to store in two states (on/off). For storing a decimal number that way, you'd need a technical way to store 10 different states of a thing.  They talked about the subsequent steps afterwards: When the computer is expecting some form of command, such a string of numbers can be interpreted as Opcodes, i.e. things like \"read\" and \"add\", etc.  Depending on the program that is running, data can be interpreted in different ways after that: If it's an image viewer, the 10011100 11110010 can be translated into colour information for a pixel. If it's a text file, it may be letters. If it's a MS Word file, maybe it's text, and a formatting code for \"bold\". And if it's another program, the data may be interpreted as another command that is executed by that program.
