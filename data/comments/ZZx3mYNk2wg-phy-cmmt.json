Secondly, you then moved onto orbits which can not be scientifically tested and there are no tests to prove anything can \"orbit\" using any unseen forces. Magnets can not  be configured to orbit. No proof of orbiting is available or a centrifugal force. Thirdly, centripetal force is a false conception designed to confuse regurgitating ball Earth proponents because without it heliocenticity falls apart on its face. Google it, they sight tires and ropes as a force, hilarious balltarded dumb  garbage is the lie of centripetal force.

Its coordinates are x=R*cos(theta) and y=R*sin(theta), where theta is the angle from the +x direction.  We'd like to get the angle theta in terms of speed v and time t.  It travels an arc length equal to v*t, and this arc length can convert to an angle in radians, by dividing by radius.  Thus: theta = v*t/R  Adjust our x and y values accordingly: x = R*cos(v*t/R) y = R*sin(v*t/R)  Take the derivative to find the corresponding velocity components, vx and vy: vx = dx/dt vy = dy/dt vx = -R*sin(v*t/R) * v/R vy = R*cos(v*t/R) * v/R vx = -v*sin(v*t/R) vy = v*cos(v*t/R)  Take the derivative again to get acceleration: ax = dax/dt ay = day/dt ax = -v*cos(v*t/R) * v/R ay = -v*sin(v*t/R) * v/R  Simplify: ax = -v^2/R * cos(v*t/R) ay = -v^2/R * sin(v*t/R)  Add up in Pythagorean theorem to get the magnitude of a: |a| = sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2) |a| = v^2/R*sqrt((-cos(v*t/R))^2 + (-sin(v*t/R))^2)  The sqrt term equals 1, regardless of what v*t/R equals.  Thus we have: |a| = v^2/R", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZZx3mYNk2wg", "cid": "UgzL1Jce2xVHBISHf814AaABAg.97N1r9Q-xdTA4zSO-FebHd", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@carultch\u00a0brother it's been THREE YEARS I don't think he needs it anymore.
