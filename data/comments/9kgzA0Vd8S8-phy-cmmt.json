Just getting your power from an electrical line is pretty inefficient.  I think heat loses still acount for a 30% inefficiency + inefficienies in energy creation +  will have to account for loses in the car itself.  I doubt its much better than simply getting an actual car.  So the emission savings are not nearly what people think they are because most power in US is made from gas or coal.  Im not anti electric cars but I think people should not be ignorant and think my car doesnt use gas Im saving the enviroment yaaaayyyyy.   Better would be us getting electric cars starting research in small mass produced reactors and then actually making a huge emission savings", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "9kgzA0Vd8S8", "cid": "UgxhQ9ns7EiZWRwK97h4AaABAg", "comment": "First , let me say the \u201cCrash Course\u201d series is an informative, fun and fast paced resource that PBS should be proud to air. I have one question. It\u2019s stated in the \u201c How Power\u2026\u201d episode that transformers only work with alternating current. In my opinion, this isn\u2019t true. Automobiles, motorcycles, watercraft and a few other examples use step up transformers in their d/c supplied ignition systems. Instead of saying transformers \u2018only on work with a/c power supplies\u2019 perhaps change the statement to transformers only work with a cycling or digital power supply. In these ignition systems, 12vdc is apply to the primary side of the ignition coil. And weather a PCM commands the circuit open or a set of breaker points disconnects the coil from ground, the same thing is happening. The magnetic field in the primary (12vdc) coil collapses, inducing a \u201cstepped up \u201c voltage (40,000vdc) in the secondary winding, and this fires the spark plug.

Then, the changing magnetic field causes a voltage in the secondary coil.  In order for a transformer to work, the magnetic field has to be changing.  (See the previous video in this series on induction.)  The voltage in the secondary is related to the voltage in the primary by the ratio of the number of turns in each.   Example:  If I feed 120 volt AC into a transformer whose primary coil has 10 turns, and whose secondary coil has 20 turns, the voltage on the secondary will be 240 volts AC.  If we hook the secondary to a power consuming device, such as a light bulb, then current will flow.  The current in the secondary will be 1/2 of the current in the primary.

Power, though, is voltage times current, so you can increase the power transmitted on a line, without increasing the resistive loss, by increasing voltage.  Power is what customers want and pay for, so increasing the voltage on a transmission line is a way to transmit more of what the customers want, without increasing losses in the line.  Note that there are limits to raising the voltage on a transmission line.  An obvious one is that at high enough voltage, an arc will form between the conductors, not a good thing.
