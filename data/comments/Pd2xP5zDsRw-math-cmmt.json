So far in this calculus course, we examine an integral and know the antiderivative in terms of functions we've seen before, known also as \"elementary functions\". There is no elementary function that exists as the antiderivative of f(x) = exp(-x^2). Another way to put this along the lines of the lecture: What (elementary) function can we write whose derivative is exp(-x^2)? We can't. Instead, we operate with d/dx on the integral of exp(-t^2) with respect to t between the limits of 0 and x and that \"washes away\" the constant represented by the lower integration limit.
