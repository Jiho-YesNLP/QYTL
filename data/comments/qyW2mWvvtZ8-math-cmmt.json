The mixed fraction 1 1/3 basically means 1+1/3, it\u2019s just written in a more compact way. When you add fractions you need to make sure the dominator, bottom number, for both fractions are the same. Often times fractions can be simplified into integers (whole numbers) or fractions with a smaller denominator through division. In this case 3/3=1, another example 64/6=64/(2*3)=(64*1/2)/(1/2*2*3)=(64/2)/3=32/3. Notice that in the second example I multiplied the top and bottom by 1/2, to get rid of the 2 on the bottom, which is the same as multiplying by 1, since (1/2)/(1/2)=1. So we see 64/6=32/3. However if we we want to add this with another fraction say 5/6 we would need to multiply the top and bottom of 32/3 by 2 to get the same denominator as 5/6. That\u2019s of course what we started with, 64/6. Adding these together we get 64/6+5/6=(64+5)/6=69/6=69/(2*3)=(69*1/3)/(2*3*1/3)=23/2. We can write this as an improper fraction by breaking this up into two fractions. We know 23/2=22/2+1/2=11+1/2. Therefore 23/2 is equal to the mixed fraction 11 1/2.
