As a programmer with 50 years of experience, I must say that we have lost touch with algorithms in the sense I discuss in my articles on Medium: \"Bagels and Muffins of Programming or How Easy It Is to Convert a Bagel into a Black Hole\"  Thinking algorithmically and living in an algorithm-centric world of software engineering, creating muffin-like programs, is now the domain of a few solitary individuals. Today's programming world increasingly focuses on a code-centric approach, where algorithms are not seen as separate entities. This shift has led to significant changes in how we develop and maintain software.  There was a time when algorithms were at the heart of any program, providing a clear and understandable structure for development. They helped us build logical and efficient solutions. However, with the rise of high-level programming languages and frameworks, the emphasis shifted to quickly writing code and implementing new features, often at the expense of structured algorithmic thinking.  Nowadays, we often encounter bagel-like programs where the code exists separately from the algorithm, creating internal inconsistencies and maintenance difficulties. In such conditions, achieving stability and reliability in software becomes challenging.  Returning to an algorithm-centric approach and creating muffin-like programs, where the algorithm and code are integrated, can significantly improve the quality of software. This will not only simplify testing and maintenance but also allow for more flexible and resilient systems.  I hope more developers will begin to recognize the importance of algorithms and move towards a more structured and meaningful approach to programming. Only in this way can we create software that is reliable, understandable, and easy to maintain.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "bum_19loj9A", "cid": "Ugy0rDmXdf2-Q4fsiZ54AaABAg", "comment": "This video is wonderful", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "bum_19loj9A", "cid": "UgwW_VGQx-wic4kGP914AaABAg", "comment": "are you amazing?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "bum_19loj9A", "cid": "UgygpJruS7Yp-XE0k1h4AaABAg", "comment": "The best definition of an algorithm that I've come across is as follows :  An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions on how to complete a task.

But, if I import one long clip (scenario 2), I can cut it and edit it with almost no lag or slowing down.   I just watched your video and think the difference between arrays and linked lists almost perfectly fits why this slowdown occurs. The program has an autosave function that, by design, you cannot turn off, so every change to any part of the entire video gets saved after making it. Therefore, in scenario 2, any edit I make saves quickly because it just saves the changes in the single box in the \"easy to find, partitioned place\", and does not have to change or look at any other part of the array.  Whereas,  in scenario 1, the save feature has to run through every box/clip in the video in order to find any changed clip and save the changes made.    Does this seem, generally, like an appropriate way to think of and apply array and linked list data structures?
