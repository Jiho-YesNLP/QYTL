The Akra-Bazzi Formula is used to find out the  asymptotic solution. And it requires certain  conditions to hold, including abs(epsilon(x)) = O(x/log^2 x).  The epsilon terms in the Akra-Bazzi Formula are good to handle ceiling and floor functions. As long as we can prove that epsilon(x) grows by an upper bound of (x/log^2 x) and satisfy other conditions, we can safely use the formula.  Now the question becomes showing how the epsilon terms grow.  Going back to 56:00, previously the n in S(n)is only allowed to be power of 2, but now this restriction is released. Specifically, n can now be any natural numbers and think about it:  are the following pairs the same? ceiling(2.1/2) vs ceiling(2.9/2)? ceiling(100.3/2) vs ceiling(100.9/2)? floor(2.1/2) vs floor(2.9/2)? Yes! So n is allowed to be vary within a range of 0.9999... WITHOUT affecting the asymptotic relation..therefore it (the difference) is written as less than 1 (i think it should be less than instead of less than or equal to..). And as it is always less than 1 for any n, the  upper bound condition  of (x/log^2 x) is of coz satisfied. Now, k=2, a1 = a2 = 1, b1=b2=1/2, epsilon term is fine, g(x) term is fine.

To do this, you must first somehow clear the n disks above it to the remaining peg, the third peg; let's denote the number of steps to do this as Tn, we don't care what it is, we just use a symbol to represent this number of steps. Now you can move the big disk to the middle peg. So the accumulated number of steps is now Tn + 1. Now what is left is to move all the disks that were stacked in the third peg to the middle peg. This takes exactly the same number of steps as it took to move them from the first peg to the third peg, which we denoted as Tn, so the total number of steps is Tn + 1 + Tn, hence 2Tn + 1. So, we have moved n disks, and 1 more disk, the big one, this is, n+1 disks in total. So, Tn+1 = 2Tn + 1. This is exactly the total number of steps that is required, it not an upper or lower bound, we haven't said anything yet about what Tn is, there hasn't been any need for that yet. In fact, the next thing the professor did was to guess what it could be. My intuition as to why he guessed 2^n - 1 is as follows: every disk that you add (this is, every time you increase n by one) multiplies the number of steps by 2. So, if you have n disks, you multiplied n times by 2, so you get 2^n steps. So where did the + 1 come from? Well, if n is 1, that is, you only have one disk, it takes 1 step to move it to the middle. 2^1 = 2, so you have to subtract 1: Tn=2^n - 1.
