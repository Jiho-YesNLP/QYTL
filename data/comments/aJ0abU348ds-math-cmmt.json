You now do the same to the second side of the equation, 4 times (x + 1). 4 times x is 4x, 4 times 1 is 4. This leaves us with 2x + 12 = 4x + 4. You're can now to merge the X terms. 4x - 2x is 2x, leaving us with 12 = 2x + 4. Subtract 4 from both sides to leave us with 8 = 2x.

The number 3 is the coefficient on x, in both examples, so in order to isolate x and make x the subject, we need to divide the equation by 3.  If the example at 1:46, were instead given as 7*x + 3 = x - 6, then you wouldn't divide by 3.  Here's how you'd solve it: 7*x + 3 = x - 6  Subtract 3 from both sides, and simplify: 7*x = x - 6 - 3 7*x = x - 9  Subtract x from both sides and simplify: 7*x - x = -9 6*x = -9  Divide by 6: x = -9/6  Simplify and get our solution: x = -3/2", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "Ugwy9wXLk8c0oPSPc7Z4AaABAg.9c_7OWFq0GK9fJ_ZSFAzPE", "comment": "Multiply 14 by three to get 42 then add 7 to get 49 then divide by 7 to get 7", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "Ugwy9wXLk8c0oPSPc7Z4AaABAg.9c_7OWFq0GK9fJac57EIDY", "comment": "\u00a0@reaupagatpatan7612\u00a0 Hey thanks, i figured it out lol", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "Ugwy9wXLk8c0oPSPc7Z4AaABAg.9c_7OWFq0GK9fJhaqC7h4C", "comment": "\u00a0@KebabEater\u00a0 I subscribed you", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "Ugwy9wXLk8c0oPSPc7Z4AaABAg.9c_7OWFq0GK9fJibj4ILTB", "comment": "\u00a0@reaupagatpatan7612\u00a0 Thank you but there's no need i don't make any videos.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "Ugwy9wXLk8c0oPSPc7Z4AaABAg.9c_7OWFq0GK9iZpI-Sm4O9", "comment": "\u00a0@reaupagatpatan7612\u00a0 thank", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "UgxzF5KaX2JhdYjMqQJ4AaABAg.9c9SYq-jfhd9yAsBir8Uxy", "comment": "Fr like usually math teachers take like months and weeks to fully explain algebra when this guy made it to like 1 or 2 days", "votes": "10", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aJ0abU348ds", "cid": "Ugy-L-X2X4fUTGsK57h4AaABAg.9bjqFWbYXmt9j-Df07_DyN", "comment": "I'll take a shot; first distribute 2(x+2), you'll get 2x+4.
