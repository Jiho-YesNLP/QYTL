Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ! Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. ACCORDINGLY, the Moon AND THE PLANETS move AWAY very, very, very slightly in comparison to WHAT IS THE SUN !! SO, carefully consider what is THE EYE !! Finally, think about what is the speed of light (c). E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma (ON BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !  Magnificent. It ALL does CLEARLY make perfect sense ON BALANCE !!! This does explain the fourth dimension, including the term c4 therewith !!! \"Mass\"/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.) Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !

The sky is BLUE, AND what is THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !! (Notice what is THE EYE !!) ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE, AS gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy !!! Great.  Carefully consider what is the Sun. (Very importantly, outer \"space\" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) Consider what is BALANCED observer dependent/related experience ! Carefully consider the man (INCLUDING what is THE EYE) who actually IS in outer \"space\". NOW, think about TIME; AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. INSTANTANEITY is therefore FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience. So, here we have established what can basically and sensibly be understood as constituting a one dimensional relation. A white dwarf star is about the size of the Earth, AND it is ALSO (ON BALANCE) the PROJECTED form or fate (IN TIME) of the Sun !!! Great !!! Stellar clustering ALSO proves (ON BALANCE) that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Against what is outer \"space\", why would the Sun maintain what is its \"preferential\" existence ? The answer is THE EYE/the observer. INDEED, notice that THE EYE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ! Now, ON BALANCE, consider what is the speed of light (c). A galaxy is basically FLAT. SO, think about a TWO dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) as well. HALF of the galaxies are \"dead\" or inert, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma !! Carefully consider what is THE EYE !!

BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand !!!  GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Consider WHAT IS THE MAN who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Think about TIME !!! NOW, the stars AND PLANETS do REMAIN AS what are POINTS in the night sky. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. This explains the cosmological redshift AND the \"black holes\". Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The fact that the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution is not a meaningless coincidence, AS the fact that both the Sun AND the Moon are the SAME SIZE in the sky is not some sort of a meaningless coincidence. Notice the match with the size of what is THE EYE. Magnificent !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE, AS gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.

I'll give you the derivation of moment of inertia for a uniform cylinder about its long cylindrical axis.  Given a uniform cylinder of length L, density rho, and overall radius R, its volume is pi*R^2*L, and its total mass M is pi*rho*R^2*L.   We'll get back to this later.  Divide the cylinder into an infinite number of thin cylindrical shells, each of thickness dr, at position r from the axis of rotation.  Call the cylinder length L.   The mass of each cylindrical shell is therefore dm = 2*pi*r*rho*L*dr.   The circumference is 2*pi*r, the length is L, the thickness is dr, which gives volume 2*pi*r*L*dr.  Multiply by density rho to get differential mass.  Now apply r^2, since moment of inertia is integral r^2 dm.   This makes our integrand become: 2*pi*rho*r^3*L*dr  Pull 2*pi*rho*L out in front of the integral, since all of this is a constant: 2*pi*rho*L * integral r^3*dr   Carry out integral of r^3 dr from r=0 to r=R.  Simple application of the power rule.  Increment the exponent by 1, and take its reciprocal to form the leading coeficient. [r^4/4] eval from 0 to R =  R^4/4  Reconstruct: I = 2*pi*rho*L*R^4/4  Simplify: I = pi*rho*L*R^4/2  Factor out R^2/2: I = (pi*rho*L*R^2) * R^2/2  Recognize that the expression in parenthesis is the total mass M.
