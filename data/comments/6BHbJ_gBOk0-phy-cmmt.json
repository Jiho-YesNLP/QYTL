For water the value is 4.184 J/K\u00b7g, copper on the other hand has a specific heat capacity of 0.385 J/K\u00b7g. Thus water can actually absorb nearly 10.9 times the energy per unit mass than copper for the same change in temperature, the effect is of course somewhat smaller per unit volume since copper is 8.96 times the density of water but still it's 1.21 times the heat energy per unit volume.  Course how fast different materials actually heat up in practice depends on a whole host of other factors too for direct heat transfers mostly that would be the thermal conductivity though for fluids even the shape of the container or basin can be a factor due to the effects of fluid dynamics and convection.

With liquid oxygen, it's the opposite, your hand is the flame.

In addition to getting longer, the bar may indeed get \"thicker\" as well and depending on what you want the shape to do or what you permit the shape to do, say for engineering purposes, this change in thickness may be too big and cause trouble.  Think of a shim in between two other shims, the middle shim is getting more compressed by the outer shims like a sandwich as it gets heated and gets \"thicker\" - the outer shims push back!  Will it break and cause a bridge collapse?  Thats what you will know how to answer if you take engineering and get paid for it to boot :)  As a more complete answer, the precise change of dimensions (call it dx,dy,dz) of any arbitrary shape at any point on the shape due to a temperature change is explained by more complete equations that not only consider the coefficient of linear thermal expansion in three dimensions (x,y,z) but also consider Poissons Ratio, Youngs Modulus and Shear Modulus for that material - I cant remember if theres any other properties you'd need, its been a while.  Could there be a way to combine all these properties to get some \"volume\" coefficient of thermal expansion or has someone done experiments to find a volume thermal expansion for different solids?
