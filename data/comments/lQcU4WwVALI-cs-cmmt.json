In that case, the formula would be: H1T1 + H2T2 + T3  Edit: i also think the second formula, for way 2, should be: H1T1 + (1-H1)H2T2 + T3 Because if processor cant find info in M1, it tries M2 but only needs T2 amount of time, not T1+T2.

I don't think it can happen. H3 isn't explicitly written because it's assumed to be 100%. H1 and H2 are just the chances of finding the information you want in different memory levels, but if they're neither in M1 or M2 then they're definitely in M3, the secondary memory.  Now I'm definitely second guessing my answer because null reference exceptions are very common errors that can creep up in many programming languages. Specifically when code is executed at runtime that attempts to reference a variable that contains no value.
