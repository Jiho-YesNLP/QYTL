You don't take the K matrix from the fixed-fixed case and change its first entry to a 1.  To form T, you add a new row and column to the top left of the K matrix, both of which start with (1, -1) and end with zeros.  Consequently, the right hand side also needs an additional entry at the top.  In the uniform load case, the correct number was 1/2, but for the discrete delta, the load at u0 is 0, so this new entry should be a zero.", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5Pw5k0z1L4Q", "cid": "UgiBHuvUmFyhsngCoAEC", "comment": "There is a critical fact about working with the discrete delta function that he never mentions in this lecture, and it is only included as an afterthought in section 1.4 of the book, but if you don't recognize it, you will NEVER get your discrete solutions to match the real ones.  In the continuous problem, the integral of the load over the line is 1.  We would like the same to be true in the discrete problem, but if you use a column of the identity matrix as your right hand side, the integral is 1*h=h.  Thus, in order for the answer to scale properly, it has to be divided by h, or equivalently, you can think of dividing the load vector by h.

The right segment of the solution curve is a straight line with slope -1 with x-intercept x=1.  If you extend this line all the way back to the y-axis, it is also the graph of another function: for any point x on the bar, what is its elevation above the ground?  (Answer: 1-x).  The solution to the free-fixed problem says that for any point at or below where the mass is hung, its displacement will be equal to its starting elevation, meaning that it is squashed down to the ground (NOT the picture drawn by Prof. Strang, which only shows modest compression). Of course, this is because the differential equation does not include any force, proportional to displacement, acting against this, such as Hooke's Law, if the compressing bar were to be modeled as a spring.  As a result, it's hard to see this as anything other than an exercise in manipulating equations that don't correspond to any interesting real situation.

Here, I'd try to explain the free case he has written(Use 'Tex for all things' chrome extension to display what I write as actual Math). We are looking for a discrete solution $u = (u_0,u_1, \\dots, u_{n+1})$ of the Differential equation $-u'''= f$.  The boundary values $u_0$ and $u_{n+1}$ are fixed by boundary conditions. our matrix $K$ will help us determine the interior values $(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n)$.   At the interior point $j = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, we need $(u_{j-1} - 2u_{j} + u_{j+1})/h^2 =  f(x_j)$. These conditions give the matrix. The top row will be determined by the case $j=1$. That is, by the equation -   $(u_0 - 2u_1 + u_2)/h^2 =  f(x_1)$.   In the fixed case, $u_0 = 0$, so the equation becomes $(-2u_1 + u_2)/h^2 =  f(x_1)$.  So the first row is $[-2,1,0,\\dots, 0]$. In the free case, as done in the video lecture, we had $u_1 = u_0$, so the equation $(u_0 - 2u_1 + u_2)/h^2 =  f(x_1)$  becomes $(u_1 - 2u_1 + u_2)/h^2 =  f(x_1)$, i.e., $(-u_1 + u_2)/h^2 =  f(x_1)$. Thus, the first row is $[-1,1,0,0, \\dots,0]$  I guess that's it, lemme know if something's incorrect or vague.
