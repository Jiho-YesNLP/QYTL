In the end the validity of the function mapping rests on the reasoning provided, which itself already does the counting.  I believe the idea of using a function to map one set to another is to abstract specific details away from the problem and so offer greater clarity with the resulting simplified set (the codomain). This was powerfully demonstrated in mapping all possible subsets of a set of size n to possible bit-sequences of length n in the previous lecture. However in those examples in this lecture, the codomain was not specified precisely. Moreover, the direction of the function mapping was not consistent, as one might observe from the 2 pairs example.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "UgjimSjzZ1hvVHgCoAEC", "comment": "Great lecture, thanks!", "votes": "7", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "Ugw1O2za78LY85bt6FV4AaABAg.9R77v4V6e-F9cmNXG1GgTg", "comment": "I bet you are fun at parties :)", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "Ugw0F3xEUwW86zdSjmd4AaABAg.91T1G1exgI_9HjxHYcqc0A", "comment": "\u00a0@yicheng1991\u00a0 Professor Leighton said in one of the lectures that there would not be enough time to cover these subjects in class, but they are in the textbook for anyone that is interested.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "UgzlP_2cI2zjX60n-7F4AaABAg.8w9lLtiA62T9uQVj6XEeZZ", "comment": "Even If he is not reading this, .. :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "UgzlP_2cI2zjX60n-7F4AaABAg.8w9lLtiA62T9y-4byEMauX", "comment": "Actually if \"your are reading this\" is false then the implication still holds.\u00a0@shwetanktewari7762\u00a0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "Ugy4YwaNnH6QbvtasK94AaABAg.8u6_wihtfff8w9hgEdhHpC", "comment": "We shouldn't do criticize the free stuff", "votes": "8", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "Ugy4YwaNnH6QbvtasK94AaABAg.8u6_wihtfff97oVZt_zSr4", "comment": "idk must be you", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "09yIb3VHhMI", "cid": "Ugy4YwaNnH6QbvtasK94AaABAg.8u6_wihtfff98ITFulhJyj", "comment": "The same for me, but teaching is also an iterative process.
