(ie: we all say you are wrong and if you disagree you are delusional) well my last match was recorded and in it the ball \"curved\" either by accident or intentionally to my teams benefit, first the ball rotated from right to left while moving to the right and forward about 5-10yds, about 5ft in the air.  the second I rebounded the ball moving at about 10-15mph and struck it to give it a spin from right to left as I launched it about 40-60yrds towards the opposing goal, and as I intended, as the ball decended not in a straight line from where I struck it launching the ball forward but about 5-10 (15-20 would be quite a wide angle) degrees to the left of where it was originally launched to its trajectory. keep in note that draft plays 0 role in this virtual physical simulation however trajectory, impact, speed, position, accuracy, precision, as causes are, and this effects, ball height, ball trajectory, ball momentum, ball position, ball spin, and ball start and end locations.   some players believe that the ball can not be made to spin, either accidentally or otherwise.  I have multiple goals that say otherwise. but just to make sure im not crazy Im watching this video on rotation. because im pretty fucking sure the ball in rocket league spins and due to that spin the balls trajectory is not always a direct line with equal heights before and after its parabola.    the ball can infact start at one height and begin its decent at a much lower altitude due to the curvature of its flight path, due to the rotation effect described in this video also being accounted for in rocket league. if the ball is spinning and shot into the air it may not land directly across from where it was struck. hence, due to the rotation effect, the ball is caused to curve, and this can be used to manipulate its trajectory off an otherwise straightforward flightpath. don't flatearthhero this now. because he was made to look dumb for his ignorance quite easily. can I have 100k if I curve the ball in rocket league because it would really pay off some debts I have and help with my ambitions. of course I can, he will never pay.", "votes": "9", "replies": "4", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WQ9AH2S8B6Y", "cid": "Ugx0j4DC6kuoql3BHsZ4AaABAg", "comment": "your teaching has real clarity", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WQ9AH2S8B6Y", "cid": "UgyQnDhb445sYhG602Z4AaABAg", "comment": "It still bewilders me how clear your teaching style is for me.", "votes": "365", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WQ9AH2S8B6Y", "cid": "UgzyrL2mMbJ91Yep4hh4AaABAg", "comment": "Hello, is there by any chance that you have a lecture on periodic motion ( simple harmonic motion with all of the formulas included)?
