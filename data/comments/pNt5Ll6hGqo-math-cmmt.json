Since, there is a wider range, than there is input combinations,  It's possible for each input to have it's own output without repeating. In fact, just by using an simple excel spreadsheet, I found several combinations that works without repeating.   One such example was 10, 12,13,14,23,38,53,85,93,99. You could try to look for any two sets of numbers that have the same sum, but you will not find such a thing.
