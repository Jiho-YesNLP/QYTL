I would say it's for like 13, 14 y.o. (I'm asking because I'm foreign and I'm learning chemistry not only in my mother language but in english as well, because there are much, much more study materials on internet in english, and I'm tutoring chemistry, therefore I'm interested in the learning process of chemistry in other countries.)

Name the elements in latin (and then half the way down change to english with latin suffixes for no good reason), use greek prefixes to indicate number, then use arabic numerals as subscripts and superscripts. This is science, not the Da Vinci code. Pretty sure if the astronomers can demote Pluto then chemists can come up with a less scattered nomenclature.", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kc0WFJtOvM8", "cid": "UgwObphzuof8Q2pXPGV4AaABAg", "comment": "do you sell those shirt?", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kc0WFJtOvM8", "cid": "UgxVE_n7XyF8ha9RGcZ4AaABAg", "comment": "thank you so much!!!!

So two of them would have a total charge of -2 which is why Cu had a +2 charge in CuCl2.  In CuSO4 we have a polyatomic ion, sulfate, which has a -2 charge.  Now we only have 1 sulfate ion (SO4^2-), so Cu has a +2 charge to balance.
