I have recently developed a new affection for maths and sciences. Thanks are due to you YouTubers or covid and distance learning. This is the first video I'm watching of yours.   Anyway, I am in question about the balloon problem. How I picture it.   If it were a ball it would have a more rigid structure.  It could, absent of any foreign influence, remain a ball. Thus allowing the air inside to be neutral to the air outside. Isn't this the viable situation needed, to be able to apply your formula?     The balloon, on the other hand, is completely limp and non-rigid when neutral until more and more air gets forced into it and is pressurized enough to form the ball shape which we can use your formula. But now the balloon has a positive air pressure. Wouldn't that create a need to know the psi of the balloon to get an accurate mass measurement?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZcJGFZt-NO4", "cid": "Ugw8La4QS9V5MVCoGTN4AaABAg", "comment": "Can you solve more questions on Density of mixtures?", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZcJGFZt-NO4", "cid": "UgxQp14Rn3lhTvCxuo94AaABAg", "comment": "I will never forget how much you helped me during my pre med studies...

Air and water have a natural buoyancy.....  You cannot measure gravi because it doesn't existThe only way you can even think of measuring gravity is going outerspace and getting something big or small to measure the type of force which is placed on a object  Since we cannot do this and not even tried we cannot replicate gravity and since we cannot replicate gravity we can not say for sure if it exist in the 1st place  We know for sure even in space things can weigh-in have some mass to it but at that point we would need a force pushing down to measure it.....  It is one said when you are in the water are you wet when you're in it or wet when you come out  Same goes for gravi when you are in it is it I'll force or when you out of it is it forced on you  Everything gets pushed down equally but bigger things are heavier and smaller things are lighter the pending on the mass or the flatness   A helium balloon rises and are Feather Falls where does gravi fit into this the balloon is wider in ways more then the feather but the air inside of it defeats gravity ????
