But the thing is that the last octet value in the subnet mask is 202, which is not a valid octet value. To get a valid octet value, you need to check between which two valid octet values 202 lies, which is between 192 and 224. Now if you have a subnet mask 255.255.255.224, you would get at most 32 valid addresses (30 hosts + 2 reserved addresses each for network address and broadcast address), which cannot accommodate 52 hosts at all. So you need to assign the subnet mask as 255.255.255.192, then you can get 64 valid addresses possible (62 hosts + 2 reserved addresses each for network address and broadcast address). Then you can easily accommodate 52 hosts within these 64 valid addresses.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "w5bMxHxELaI", "cid": "UgxoY0SBbmI85ZYbw0V4AaABAg.9dmulOyVaF29o_TQPBpZlv", "comment": "\u00a0@ArghyadeepPal\u00a0 Thank you. It seems that if the host requirements are such that if the number of hosts is a power of 2, then the subnet classes will nicely divide the subnet ranges.
