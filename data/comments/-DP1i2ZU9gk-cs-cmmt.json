Each reference points to the memory location where the actual object data is stored. These references are arranged in contiguous memory blocks, enabling efficient data access.  Here\u2019s how element access works using an index i:   Address(i) = base_address + (i * element_size)   - base_address: This is the memory location of the first reference in the list. - i: This is the index of the element you want to access.  - element_size: This is the uniform size of each reference in the list.  This formula calculates the memory address where the reference to the actual object is stored. By maintaining a constant size for each reference, Python lists can directly compute the memory location of any element\u2019s reference using its index. This avoids the need to traverse other elements, ensuring efficient and direct access.  This \u201coffset strategy\u201d is crucial. It ensures that the processor can instantly calculate where each element\u2019s reference is located in memory, regardless of the size of the actual data pointed to by the reference. This method effectively decouples the size of the actual object data from the efficiency of accessing an element by its index, allowing Python lists to manage data of varying sizes efficiently.  In terms of actual data structures related to computer science, it is NOT a \u201clinked list\u201d in the literal sense as this is what the slide is eluding to, particularly where it illustrates the tail of a preceding \u2018cell\u2019 is point to the head of a subsequent \u2018cell\u2019.  I get this just to illustrate python lists conceptually but at best it\u2019s either a misunderstanding about the actual underlying data structure used to implement a python list (dynamic array) and at worst dumbing this down to be an imprecise and complicated analogy.  The car analogy was perfect.

But aside that it's the same thing. Another tip is that self. You use self ALWAYS (as long it's not static method) in class methods as a first parameter, even if method do not return anything, IT MUST HAVE that 1st parameter called self (stick to self). Another example, lady showed you bad example in 25:50, there is an easy way to do it by just declaring \"static method\" inside class so then you could use 2 objects like c.x and zero.x. And also I'd like to add this important answet to student who asked \"how do we know if it's a float/string or int\", we could determine specific data type in that constructor _init_ (or call it whatever you want) by just adding simple notation like def _init_ (self, x: str, y: int): ...  so now if you have mypy, it will always watch if X is string and Y int, if not then error. You dont need to add some extra code inside method as lady said, waste of lines. and Lastly important info for you, join official python discord for help/resources here: https://discord.gg/python     and here you have some resources you can learn from / improve: https://pythondiscord.com/pages/resources/", "votes": "6", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-DP1i2ZU9gk", "cid": "UgwtqpA8b4bc5Y2gFF54AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you internet! \u2764\ufe0f", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-DP1i2ZU9gk", "cid": "UgxJ29qUd2gxG3Ns1J14AaABAg", "comment": "you dont have to inherit from class object in python 3", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-DP1i2ZU9gk", "cid": "UgyS8IfA_j5dSYWgocl4AaABAg", "comment": "I heard once to think of OOP classes as blueprints.

Software engineering, for me as for many others that get into it, has been quite a surprise. First of all, most people that get into it think it's like programing but there's a difference: software engineering is about providing quality solutions to a given problem using quality software designed using engineering principals, therefore a software engineer, eventho he/she knows how to program (and trust me, you WILL program) is better suit at designing the system itself, that's why you're taught things as database modeling and all as soon as second year.  First and second year, as in most engineering stuff, is kinda Wide, meaning it's a general purpose year where you share all of the subjects with your mates from other engineering paths that might be similar to yours. You'll be taught a lot of mathematical concepts and the basics of programing+the not so basics. You'll also be taught (probably) the fundamentals of computers as in logic gates, secuencial circuits, you'll have to build yours using lab material and all.

Those underscores differentiate built-in \"accessories- I might say\" from those user-defined. those are like built-in functions. For example, when python interpreter sees a \"+\" in a script associated with this object instances (like in \"c + origin\"), it's going to implicitly call \"_add__\" function(as written on the definition of that instance's object) and act accordingly what's written on that subroutine. You could implement \"adding two coordinates/fractions\" in your way-like defining a function as \" def add(self,other)--the exact subroutine follows--\", but then you won't be able to add two instances(coordinates or fractions or whatever) using shorthand \"+\" notation(like frac1+frac2), you'd have to explicitly tell that frac1.add(frac2), otherwise, you'd get an error. So,  __add__, __float_ etc have the traits they have because python implies that they have, not because of \"underscores\", the underscores just differentiate them from others, marking them special; they do not not make something special.
