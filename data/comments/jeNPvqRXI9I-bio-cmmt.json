Biology and the Genetics Therein: 1) Linkage (Gametogenesis has the Cellular Division known to Make a Diploid Cell-Haploid Cells) Where the Recombination Possibility of Linkage can Occur; 2) Crossing Over or the Meiotic Event might have a Crossing Over ; 3) Gene Mapping Is an Effort to Characterize the Genotype (Genome) along the lines of Quantity, Length From the Centromere, (But essentially would be to map and correlate site, structure (Genotype Quantification) with Function; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) a typically Autosomal Dominant (AD) Inheritance Pattern However unlikely there can be an X-Linked Pattern Making the likely hood more in favor of One Particular Sex Phenotype over the Other Sex based on the Affected Parent. The Meiosis Phase 2 Result is missing in the Illustration but hopefully not crucial in the Essence of this Lecture.   PhD Adam Martin es geht sehr Gut aber Gesund(tight) an ihnen Auch (Witzig).
