Since no z-term is given, it doesn't take place in 3-dimensional space, but only in a single plane.  C may look like it is a variable, but it is a constant in this particular context.  Usually, the early lettters in the alphabet are used as constants, and the letters at the end of the alphabet are used as variables (either spatial dimension variables specifically, or variables in general that don't necessarily stand for anything).  BlackPenRedPen has a video on the Mathematician's alphabet, going over what the letters most commonly stand for in mathematics.  You can rearrange this format, and find the y=m*x+b form of this line.  Note that my little b is not necessarily equal to your big B.
