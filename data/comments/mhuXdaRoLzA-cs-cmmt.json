CSMA/CD says that it can detect a collision between two nodes if the transmission time is long enough. Such that a node can warn the connected other node that a collision has occured while that node is sending. Problem is that a node further away could send something, and corrupting a message that is already sent. I don't see how there is a solution for this", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "UgwbpoGnKxBq4oRIKcB4AaABAg", "comment": "In what type of environment would this exposed terminal problem even exist? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something but need help figuring out what.   If A, B, C, and D are all on the same channel, I would expect one of those (such as B) to be an access point while A and C are clients, so A only talks to B, and C only talks to B. So the only reason C would talk to D is if D is another access point which means if designed well would be on another channel and C/D wouldn\u2019t even hear transmissions from B or A even if they were close enough  So would this problem only arise where all four nodes are in Ad-hoc mode with no Access Point, or if the system operator is forced to have adjacent Access Points on the same channel due to lack of available channels?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "Ugy7-5C7grApT-NMuTZ4AaABAg", "comment": "mass vro", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "UgzIDEJgGuhZAzOkMZF4AaABAg", "comment": "Great \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4f", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "Ugx5rdEufw9NOVTtyEp4AaABAg", "comment": "Then which algorithm.deals effectively sir?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "UgweY3BmFGMN2XYJBaB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you very much, great explanation:)", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "UgwZ36KcD9SSAWnB4Eh4AaABAg", "comment": "Tqsm!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "Ugx0gVf8qSA0Nj1aAut4AaABAg", "comment": "Goog sir", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mhuXdaRoLzA", "cid": "UgwG-UeND6x1bg8nLNB4AaABAg", "comment": "amazing sir!
