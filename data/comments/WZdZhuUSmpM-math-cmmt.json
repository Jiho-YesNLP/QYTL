Now measure the moisture content of the tree (or if you cannot measure it, then assume about 50% water content if the tree is alive). Multiply this volume by the specific mass of water = you get half of the weight of the tree. Then you multiply the other half (of roughly the other 40-45% if you could measure the moisture content) of the tree volume with the specific weight of Carbon. That will be the other half weight of the tree. Add the two together, and you get the full weight of the tree.

Now that you have the volume of the tree trunk, you multiply it with the specific weight of water and carbon in the ratio of the moisture content, subtract that from the full mass of the tree and you get the mass of the branches/canopy.
