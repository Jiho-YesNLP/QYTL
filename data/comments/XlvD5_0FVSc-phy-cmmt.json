At time t=1 and t=2 the object will be at two different locations and the difference is the vector dr. The same is also true for their velocity vectors just as the position vector. Since the speed, i.e. the length, the  magnitude of the velocities v1 and V2 is same and the difference between the two vectors is dv. The angle is also theta. As the angles are the same theta and both triangles have two sides of equal length, (The first triangle has the side length r, and the second triangle v), the triangles are similar and one can write v/dv=r/dr so dv=v/r*dr. And recall the acceleration can also be written as dv/dt as the change in velocity divided by the change in time. If you put v/r*dr in the place of dv in the second equation you get (v/r)*(dr/dt). Recall how we defined r as a position vector. So dr/dt is the change in position divided by change in time which is nothing other than velocity.
