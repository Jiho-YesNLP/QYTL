I'm rewatching these videos in preparation for an exciting teaching opportunity and I want to make sure to polish my knowledge. In any case, I wanted to take this chance and say thank you for your amazing videos! I also noticed that you brought up Br and Cl as examples for the weighted average calculations, which is really cool since this concept is repeated again in orgo when we talk about mass spec. Out of all the textbooks/resources I've used, I've never came across a resource that specifically uses these two elements to teach atomic weight. These small details really help because they ultimately contribute to a bigger picture, and these connections help more than you may think.
