Great explanation!  I have got a few questions: 1. If we store integers in a consecutive bytes in memory, and we do the same for arrays of integers, then how does memory understand that it is an array and not just separate integers? 2. - I have the same question for how memory is split between applications. Let\u2019s say I have Pycharm running, and then I start Chrome and Slack, they have got their space in memory. But what happens when I use all the space for PyCharm and it reached the start of Chrome's memory.. If I need more space for PyCharm, how and where it will be allocated? I can see in the Activity Monitor app on mac, that memory for Chrome is split into different items. Does it mean that if we run out of memory for a specific application, it will try to allocate new space somewhere else in the memory?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgxxnFVNITqpZ5o7YsR4AaABAg", "comment": "you're a amazing guy! i wish i could meet you one day!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgwpWRdg9LYBm2zB1t14AaABAg", "comment": "Can you make a video aboout getters/setters, returns means in java plis?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyoYTNdLDp7iLcL3-N4AaABAg", "comment": "thank you so much \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyZ93hkMnTFjgXTM_Z4AaABAg", "comment": "Key Points: - It's very unusual to have mixed variable types in an array - You can't just add more partitions at the end of an array After already allocating memory for a list, you don't know what'll be allocated after that and to store an array you need consecutive bytes.

I would like to ask you the most important question ever asked:    Who is  Jesus? Not who is He to you. Rather, who is He really?  Jesus is the Son of God, who came to the world as a man. He lived a perfect and sinless life . Even though He was perfect and sinless, on the cross of Calvary God wrathfully punished Him for the sins of the world. 3 days later He rose from death. Now He is seated at the right hand of God, ruling as King over Heaven and Earth. On the judgment day He will judge you, me and every human being that has ever lived. Those who believed in Him will enter eternal joy with Him, but those who did not believe in Jesus will be sent to eternal condemnation.   So turn from your sins and believe in the Jesus, that you can be forgiven for all your sins, because of His death and resurrection.  Acts 15:11 \u201dOn the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.\" Ephesians 1:7 \u201dIn Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace\" Ephesians 2:8 \u201dFor it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,\u201d  John 11:25-26: \"Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?' 1 Corinthians 6:14: \"And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.\" Romans 6:9: \"We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.\"", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgzucZmRUxkja3uRzrV4AaABAg", "comment": "if u see this comment - good luck!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgxHQOLZUW1IO-RWZct4AaABAg", "comment": "i m really glad i found you in my learning process", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgwIW6uF1coZlF6Ij6t4AaABAg", "comment": "you have to call introductions playlist not data structure lol", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgzKbawO_6nS5vFSR1p4AaABAg", "comment": "in python you can increase the length of an array though", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyOw8nQy5z8-O1aV_B4AaABAg", "comment": ":eyes-pink-heart-shape:", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "Ugzocrn5gwI8jj1-BTZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you very much \u2764\ud83d\ude4f", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "Ugz2vXyUgCvFEF_3_gN4AaABAg", "comment": "This is such a great video, you do an amazing job of breaking down everything and your examples are easy to follow along with!

The explanation of why arrays cannot be easily extended was way too long. You digressed to explain the difference between RAM and Disk storage, and then to explain about storage for different types (which by the way is hardware platform and/or language specific), and then finally you got back to arrays and consecutive bytes.   Here is a quick one: You cannot resize arrays easily because you always need consecutive bytes and you never know what is stored past the end of your current array.

After the array is made and it's already in the memory, it's unclear to the computer if there will be empty bytes after the array's position(like another int or String after the array) and because of that and that the bytes of the array need to be continuous, you can't just allocate more space in memory to add more data in an array.

The index does pointer arithmetic(essentially adds to the base memory address) so if you wanted to go to the first element in the array it would be at the base address + 0 since it is already at the first location. However, if you wanted to access the second element in the array it would be located at the base memory address + 1 (in hexadecimal in the background) since the array allocates memory right next to each other.

Because obviously you can only put another 4-byte piece of data in that slot and the more you delete older data, the more gaps you'll have, increasing potentially wasted memory.

Basically the issue you describe is memory fragmentation. Chunks of free memory surrounded by chunks of used memory.   I believe the C programming language uses a system of binned free lists to solve this problem. So in your example if you deleted a 4-byte array, that memory would be freed up and the address to the start location of that memory would be stored in a list of other addresses that also have 4-bytes of space free. Similarly, if you deleted a bigger array -- let's say of size 256 bytes -- the address of that memory would be stored in a list of of other memory locations with at least 256 bytes free. Now when you're trying to allocate a new object, the OS can behind the scenes select an appropriate location from one of your freed memory lists and thus help the memory not have as much wasted space.   It is worth noting that the size of lists will usually be rounded to a common magnitude. So if you were trying to delete an array of size 273 bytes, that would probably fall into the same bin of free memory locations as the 256 byte array. Also if free memory locations are directly next to each other, they can be combined and placed into a bigger list of free memory.  To read more about this, this is a good link: http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html  Also worth noting that in languages like Python handle a lot of this automatically. If you are interested in learning more about how memory allocation and deallocation is handled automatically look into reference counting and garbage collection.

At the same time though, I think it needs to be applied in the right context for it to be truly useful. For instance, predicting your reply to someone's message might not be that convenient since it'll never be that accurate anyway. On the other hand, the recommendation engines on platforms like YouTube, Netflix and Amazon are really useful and actually improve the user experience.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8dvNHuhsL6n", "comment": "CS Dojo Sir Please Continue the episodes of Python", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8dvNSukbnCY", "comment": "Woow", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8dvSNDThZi2", "comment": "Jaimin Sagar    Its the best idea >> To start Python", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8dvSXq-FBZr", "comment": "Sir Please Continue the Python Episodes  >>>", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8dvqWV-i4R4", "comment": "Awesome....", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8dyRfUwqRag", "comment": "CS Dojo  please complete  the python   tutorial soon...  i am following  your tutorial ... currently i am learning  it in my university  bt i don't  understand  my teacher...  i understand  your teaching  so please  complete  it first...  within  1 month  request  pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8e8ArKV1DUx", "comment": "U r osm", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8eBbS3t-6yI", "comment": "You forgot to add this video to your playlist.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm8sbPE6wb-rI", "comment": "I", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm90VqXYrbrxu", "comment": "Where university student thes add structure please ?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm90YaVcvzGaD", "comment": "How we can create second large array and how can we delete first array?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm9AZbWhxsmlX", "comment": "I will write down the contents of this video on something and shove it inside my storage", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pmN9ExDf3yQ", "cid": "UgyopXmoUf2RKCMVCLV4AaABAg.8dvMsYX56Cm9BvqsMBtchB", "comment": "Hi YK!

I would like to ask you the most important question ever asked:    Who is  Jesus? Not who is He to you. Rather, who is He really?  Jesus is the Son of God, who came to the world as a man. He lived a perfect and sinless life . Even though He was perfect and sinless, on the cross of Calvary God wrathfully punished Him for the sins of the world. 3 days later He rose from death. Now He is seated at the right hand of God, ruling as King over Heaven and Earth. On the judgment day He will judge you, me and every human being that has ever lived. Those who believed in Him will enter eternal joy with Him, but those who did not believe in Jesus will be sent to eternal condemnation.   So turn from your sins and believe in the Jesus, that you can be forgiven for all your sins, because of His death and resurrection.  Acts 15:11 \u201dOn the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.\" Ephesians 1:7 \u201dIn Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace\" Ephesians 2:8 \u201dFor it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,\u201d  John 11:25-26: \"Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?' 1 Corinthians 6:14: \"And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.\" Romans 6:9: \"We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.\"", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
