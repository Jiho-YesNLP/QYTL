The key here is that a range of values are possible from 0...n-1.  This means that zero is the minimum value and that n-1 is the maximum value.  And any integers in between are possible also.  So for n=3, the possible values of l are 0, 1, and 2.  Functionally this means that s, p, and d orbitals exist in the 3rd shell (but not f orbitals).  The electron you're referencing was in a 3p orbital, not a 3d orbital.  That is why l=1 rather than l=2, and had the electron been in the 3s orbital then l would have equaled 1.  So just keep in mind that l doesn't only equal n-1, but integers from zero to n-1 are possible and which one indicates the subshell (s, p, d, or f).
