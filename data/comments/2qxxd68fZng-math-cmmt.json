Call the arbitrary constant of integration C(y, z)  Integrate the y-component of the gradient.  Cancel terms that are already common in the previous integral.  Add terms that didn't exist in the previous integral, in place of C(y, z).  Call the arbitrary constant of integration, D(x, z).   Repeat for the z-component, and call the arbitrary constant of integration E(x, y).  Add up the three results, cancelling terms in common as you do.  Terms that are not in common, are terms that are part of the partial constant of integration functions, C(y,z), D(x,z), and E(x,y).   When you get to the end of it, call the arbitrary constant of integration K, that is now no longer a function of x, y, or z.   K can be any single number, that doesn't depend on any of our function inputs.  If the field is conservative, there will be plenty of terms that are common among each integral result.  If the field is non-conservative, you will end up with contradictory terms.  As an example, suppose our scalar function is: f(x, y, z) = x^2 + x*y*z + z*y^2 + z  Find its gradient, and call it F: F = grad f(x, y, z) F = <2*x + y*z, x*z + 2*y*z, x*y + y^2 + 1>  Integrate F's x-component: int y*z = x^2 + x*y*z + C(z, y)  Integrate F's y-component int x*z + 2*y*z = x*y*z + z*y^2 + D(x, z)  Notice that x*y*z appears in both of the above functions, which means we can cancel it in one of them, and add the two. f = x^2 + x*y*z + z*y^2 + D(z)  Now integrate F's z-component int x*y + y^2 + 1 = x*y*z + z*y^2 + z + E(x, y)  Combine the terms from all of the above, : f = x^2 + x*y*z + z*y^2 + z + K  And you see we now have our original function, with the only difference being the arbitrary constant of integration K.   There are an infinite number of potential functions for any given vector field, that all have an identical shape.     This is why we have to define a datum of potential energy in physics, where potential energy is by definition zero, for it to be meaningful.  Pay close attention to the wording of the problem.  If the problem simply says, \"find a function f(x,y,z), such that grad f(x,y,z) = vector field\", then it is OK to omit the arbitrary +K on the end.   You can keep it there as a matter of principle, but you are technically correct if you omit it, or make up your own number to take its place.   Because you found one function of the infinitely many possible answers.  By contrast, if it says \"find the potential function\", then you need to include the +K on the end.  The key difference be the article \"a\" vs \"the\", in the problem statement wording.   Different books or classes may have different conventions for naming this constant.  I learned to use K.  Most of the time when you use the potential function, you'll end up cancelling this K anyway.

Since we live in a 3-d universe, there are plenty of applications of these concepts to physical principles that govern our lives.
