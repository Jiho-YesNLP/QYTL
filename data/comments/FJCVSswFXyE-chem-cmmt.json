EINSTEIN use it's brain 0.003% in all life time. But now we all know how to achieve a New born baby kid 100 % active brain. Intelligence come from birth 1day to 6 month baby kid age time science subjects sounds listening 10 hours per day by New born baby's child from near environment before 2 year age baby kids. Brain neurone cells myelin sheaths making only in birth 1 day to 6 month age 85% + then 15% make 6 month to 2 year = 100%\ud83e\udde0 myelin sheaths make.After 2 year age New myelin sheaths,brain cells activation not possible.Human Intelligence level is actually active, working brain cells number in human brain, about 2 trillion  brain neurone cell myelin sheaths. New born  baby kid only 1 need in day  time is science subjects sounds, music, baby kids not need day time sleep. Baby kid catch every sound in only this critical age and start activation of brain cells,myelin sheaths only in baby kids before 2 year age time. This is New brain research on human kid brain. So you share with newspaper,science community, teachers,friends,kids.Yes extreme sleep is big mistake for New born baby kid before 2 year age  time. before 2 year age baby kids only 1 need in day time is science subject Sounds listening . All human 100% & 2 trillion brain commanding neurone cells active, working ,it means  super great genius scientist,honesty, happy,peace. No war,no greedy. Why a couple 4 kid different in intelligence level\u2753Why we all human defferent in intelligence level\u2753= I solved this mistry in this massage., read this message again and again.This is a pure science research on human new born kid brain cells activation, working. Why all students not interested in  fundamental subject,  necessary for life, biology, human body functioning, cells,organs , physics, chemistry, Math \u2753in human brain commanding neurone cell 2 trillion but in we all , all brain neurone cells not active,not working,, because we not listen sounds before 2 year age baby kid age time. Every stupid human done only sleep before 2 year age baby kids age time. With this new brain research now we change everything globally. In near future every human New born baby kids think and become genius scientist with simple scientific process 100% active brain cells & working brain commanding neurone cells.\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udd0a\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd31\ud83e\udd31\ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f\ud83d\udce1\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\ud83d\udcbb\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf0e live example. \ud83d\udc49This 3 year little genius girl expert of biology science name=Brielle and this 11 year genius boy  in math,physics. name Sarim Khan.
