I stopped after the definition of momentum. Especially there is a confusion between the value of momentum (the norm of the vector) which is always positive and the projection of momentum on a given oriented axis, which can be positive or negative as any algebraic value depending on the chosen orientation of the axis (which is arbitrary). Every problem in physics starts with the specification of the referential and the coordinate system. One should clearly draw the axis with its associated unit vector. Then one should explicitly expand each vector in the chosen basis. This is essential to make it really comprehensible for the students.
