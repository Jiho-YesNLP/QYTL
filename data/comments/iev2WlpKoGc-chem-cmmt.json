Its usage here is wholly inconsistent with how chemistry students have already been trained for years to see Cl- as a chlorine that's gained an electron (filling the octet so Cl - is unable to oxidize anything in its Cl- state, yet it retains the initial -1 oxidant value of a neutral Cl). Chemists should have used a new word or applied a foreign word in place of reduce. If there is a solid practical application supporting the usage of \"Reduce\" then some history or practical observations should have been used first laying the foundation for introducing the new usage-meaning with an eye for ambiguity of usage to students.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "iev2WlpKoGc", "cid": "UggdSOYWfdFRsXgCoAEC", "comment": "She is a great Chemistry teacher, but even a high school physics student would correct her in that the flow of electrons in the wire does not cause the Voltage.
