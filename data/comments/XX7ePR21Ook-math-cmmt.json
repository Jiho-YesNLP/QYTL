It is good to go into mathematics knowing that it can not be read like a novel. Thus it seems to me that it is equally important for a math student to draw their knowledge from books as for other subjects such as philosophy. If one does this and is intelligent, I think it should be possible to grasp mathematics that uses concepts one is not even familiar with and tackle these growing number of subfields in a creative way as opposed to the boring and repetitive ''banging it into your head'' maths that you see in high school.
