I guess the best way to explain why we don\u2019t include the imaginary unit i in the definition of the imaginary part of a complex number is simply because it\u2019s easier to work with. It basically comes down to understanding why we even care to take note of a complex number\u2019s real and imaginary parts. One major reason is for determining equality between complex numbers since two complex numbers are equal if and only if they have the same real parts and the same imaginary parts. When you compare complex numbers in this way, what you are ultimately doing is comparing the real numbers found within the complex number. Technically in mathematics, we can come up with our own definitions for objects that we may encounter; however, what ultimately matters when we define new objects is making sure our definitions are consistent with our other definitions in mathematics, and that they are as useful as possible. Including i in the imaginary part of a complex number does not break any mathematical truth or physical law or anything but it serves no purpose and just makes calculations involving the real and imaginary parts redundant. Although it\u2019s true that the imaginary unit is necessary for one to identify which part of a complex number is imaginary or real, when I communicate the value of the imaginary part, it is only necessary and way more efficient to communicate with the real coefficient. It\u2019s like if someone asks you what color your shirt is and you respond \u201cIt\u2019s a red shirt.\u201d By using the word shirt again, it is not incorrect, but it is redundant since it is implied by the question that your answer will refer to your shirt and nothing else, so a response like \u201cIt is red,\u201d communicates a more concise answer. A similar conundrum that I see people get confused over is how one defines the square root function. Since every real number has two square roots, one may think that the radical symbol implicitly includes both roots, but including both roots implicitly makes arithmetic with square roots much more confusing and makes the square root harder to define as a function. Instead, many mathematicians use the radical without any sign to mean the principal square root or positive square root. For example, sqrt(9) could equal 3 or -3 implicitly, but in order to make a calculation like 5+sqrt(3), simple, we take sqrt(9)=3, -sqrt(9)=-3, and + or -sqrt(9)= + or -3. This standard definition is not the only possible definition and seemingly contradicts our knowledge that every number inherently has two roots, but this definition allows us to still have both roots at our disposal (so we don\u2019t contradict the known truth that every positive real number has two square roots) but with the requirement of an explicit sign change outside of the radical in order to simplify calculations and definitions. This is very similar to the case of defining the imaginary part of a complex number as only the real coefficient of the imaginary unit in the complex number. For example, if we want to calculate the modulus or absolute value of a complex number, z= x + iy, we use the complex plane and form a right triangle and from Pythagorean\u2019s theorem get that |z|=sqrt(x^2+y^2). The modulus is still the distance of the number from zero so it must be a real number and it must be positive. From the standard definition of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, we see that we can replace these inside of the equation, so   |z|= sqrt(Re(z)^2+Im(z)^2) where Re(z)= a and Im(z)=b. There is a clean translation between the definition of the complex number and its modulus if we stick the definition that both the real and imaginary parts are real numbers and this is showcased in many other areas involving complex numbers whether they are simple arithmetic or complex analysis. In summary, the ultimate point of defining the imaginary part as the real number coefficient of the imaginary unit i is to both simplify calculations involving complex numbers and to allow one to describe complex numbers in terms of 2 real numbers (the real part and imaginary part). By calling one part, the imaginary part, we implicitly understand that the original complex number uses this number as the coefficient for the imaginary unit i like every other complex number but it is the real number coefficient that gives the information that we need in the most concise manner possible as the imaginary unit i gives redundant information.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Yddjxj49C_M", "cid": "UgySJfDNgEsOZU_2t5t4AaABAg.8a1zOymemA29sDG7WtKOrW", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@zachedwards5911\u00a0thanku u for ur time.
