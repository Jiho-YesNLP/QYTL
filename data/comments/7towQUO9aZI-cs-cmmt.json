The method you used makes it confusing and turned it into a fake overflow scenario, scenario one by no means appear positive, it's all negative wdym? Did u mean the 0 at 2^3 spot? Then circle properly. I'd suggest you guys to just use common sense and check if answer fits the range to determine overflow, his scenarios will make u fail ur tests in confusion", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "Ugz8NxE7CB0gWouIJtl4AaABAg", "comment": "Overflow \ud83c\udf1a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "UgwLCYWlsF25iwIny0F4AaABAg", "comment": "Observe?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "UgyTMQROLbyNP5eOy594AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you so much sir .This video so much helpful \ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "UgzfN7g9CaTnSN-1GI54AaABAg", "comment": "What about unsigned Substraction????", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "UgxDCnZolbG-L3dgTfd4AaABAg", "comment": "Heeeeeeeelloooooo everyone~", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "UgzIlecWmfsfJTWewYh4AaABAg", "comment": "thanks", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7towQUO9aZI", "cid": "UgxF-HjuXP3hO3Qy_X94AaABAg", "comment": "I think you have made a mistake in S1.
