Yes, I\u2019m still using linear algebra in my own private studies. I\u2019ve since gone on to self-study Sturm-Liouville theorem, the theory of integral transforms, and complex analysis,  which are really just infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Just a few minutes ago, I was solving the Poisson equation in a compact space in R2 (I just took a break, came online, and found your comment \ud83d\ude05).  Physicists always use the so-called fundamental solution (which is really just a radial basis function) to solve Poisson\u2019s equation, motivated by the fact that the laplacian has rotational symmetry in the usual sense. However, I\u2019m doing research to show that there is a more general solution involving non-radial basis functions (which makes sense as something you\u2019d look for if you\u2019ve taken a linear algebra course as fine as Professor Strang\u2019s). I find this line of inquisition interesting because the Maxwell\u2019s Equations in classical physics are really just a form of higher order Poisson equations, and their underlying potential fields are expressed as radially symmetric convolutions. But the two issues are that 1) potentials only work over all space, not in compact geometries (Helmholtz decomposition theorem) and 2) You can\u2019t capture all the expected dynamics if you\u2019re only composing your functions with radial bases. So, basically, the retarded potential solutions of E&M are just a projection of a function onto a radial subspace. Linear algebra is a good way to see this :)  So I want to figure out the most general structure of solutions to the Maxwell\u2019s equations, and then write a Machine Learning algorithm that can minimize parameters on the equation to predict the mathematically ideal electronic circuit topology given a set of constraints. As you can tell, I\u2019m a little \u201call over the place\u201d, but I still insist that this was the first class I took that gave me the confidence to do math and stick to it.  As for your final point, I\u2019ve found that the threat of bad grades generally hurts my understanding, because then I\u2019m learning to pass rather than to deeply understand. My motivation is that I\u2019m working towards a novel technology and it needs a lot of mathematics. I care deeply about said technology (the float circuit \u2014 hence the pseudonym \ud83d\ude05), so I\u2019m internally motivated. I dream lucidly about math. I can\u2019t turn it off. I have a deep appreciation for why I\u2019m trying so hard. Best wishes with everything, Lucas!  Edit \u2014  one day I\u2019ll start making YT videos documenting my way of understanding things, to help people that want to \u201cgo deeper\u201d on concepts. I just don\u2019t feel ready (knowledgeable enough) today, but that\u2019s the plan. Hopefully by this coming January.

When we multiply by a matrix we take combinations of the columns, so the range of the mapping is the column space.  If the column space doesn't span Rm, then we can see there is no way to get answers that have any components orthogonal to the column space. We call this 'orthogonal space' the left nullspace.  Similarly, when we multiply by a matrix A we take the inner product of a vector x and the rows of A.  Recall that the dot product of v.w can be thought of as capturing information of how parallel v is to w and their magnitudes (||v||||w||cos(v-w)).  Therefore in multiplying Ax = b, only the magnitude of x that is parallel to the rows of A is relevant to determining b.  In other words, components of x are either in the rowspace, or in the nullspace.  The nullspace doesn't contribute to b.  Input :  Rn  = Domain =  (Row Space + Null Space) Output  :  Rm  =  (Range / Column Space) + Left Null Space  Taking the transpose flips the input and output.  This is why for orthogonal matrices, which have orthogonal unit vectors, the inverse is the transpose.  They aren't scaling or skewing the coordinate vectors, so we can just transpose to flip the input and output and the mapping between vectors in the row and column spaces remains intact.", "votes": "15", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Go2aLo7ZOlU", "cid": "UggBsM94aAAzongCoAEC.86nuaoGudby89CYEqJrTQL", "comment": "+720SouthCalifornia Thank you for this comment!
