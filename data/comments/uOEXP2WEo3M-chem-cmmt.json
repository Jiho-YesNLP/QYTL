In this case where one copper atom has to lose only one electron to reach stable configuration, It appears like two copper atoms combined, can easily achieve +2 oxidation state than a single Zinc atom (which has to lose 2 electrons from the same atom). Also, compared to copper zinc has an excess proton, so the (second) ionization potential should be more to from Zn2+.   I could be wrong.
