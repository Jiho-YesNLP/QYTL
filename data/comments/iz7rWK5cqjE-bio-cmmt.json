The IME1 transcription factor acts in late G1 or at the G1/S transition to activate the transcription of genes in the early meiotic genetic program and to initiate meiotic S-phase (Mitchell 1994; Vershon and Pierce 2000; Kassir et al. 2003). The regulation of IME1 is accomplished by nutritional cues and other inputs. For example, only diploid cells enter the meiotic cell cycle, and it is two key sex determination regulators (known in yeasts as mating type regulators) that register the diploid state: a1/\u03b12 represses an ime1 repressor and thereby activates the meiotic program. Manipulation of nutritional cues reveals that the mitosis/meiosis decision must be maintained. Thus, starvation of diploid cells induces entry into the meiotic cell cycle, but a return to rich medium can reverse the decision and return the cell to the mitotic cell cycle; indeed \u201ccommitment\u201d to progression through meiotic prophase I can be reversed until the first meiotic division (Simchen 2009).", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "iz7rWK5cqjE", "cid": "UgxyXShAfskewX7GnWp4AaABAg.9MsXBMJQHD29gS45TB7uC4", "comment": "S. pombe The mitosis/meiosis decision in the fission yeast, S. pombe, also relies on nutrition and sex determination, but in this case, the terminal regulators of meiotic entry are not transcription factors. Instead, nutritional cues and mating-pheromone signaling trigger an elaborate cascade that ultimately controls activity of the Mei2 RNA-binding protein. Mei2 works together with the noncoding meiRNA to initiate meiotic S-phase and also to promote subsequent events in early meiotic prophase I (Watanabe and Yamamoto 1994). Whereas meiotic mRNAs are eliminated during the mitotic cell cycle, Mei2 and meiRNA antagonize that elimination and induce meiotic entry (Harigaya et al. 2006). See reviews for additional information about this intriguing mechanism of mitosis/meiosis control (Yamamoto 1996; Harigaya and Yamamoto 2007).", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "iz7rWK5cqjE", "cid": "UgxyXShAfskewX7GnWp4AaABAg.9MsXBMJQHD2A6WV5CQuuOf", "comment": "I can briefly explain it like this: You have 46 chromosomes and the person you will have a child with is like that. If it had not halved, your child would have 92 chromosomes and their child would have 184 chromosomes, so it would increase exponentially and differentiation within the species would even occur. It can often cause reproductive difficulties, genetic defects, or conditions such as polyploidy. Although polyploidy is generally beneficial in plants, it can be harmful to animals and humans.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
