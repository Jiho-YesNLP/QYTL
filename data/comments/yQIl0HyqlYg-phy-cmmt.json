Weight and mass definitely have this problem. The term weight existed before the idea of mass existed. Likely, ship deadweight is actually deadmass. At least, based on how you are explaining moment. A ton is 1,000 kg so the ship is displacing 10,000,000 kg. As you said, this is mass apparenly.  The unit for moment should be Newton meters. I still don't know why moment is calculated with kg/tonnes and not Newtons. This suggests that it actually a deadmass and not a deadweight. I don't think it has to do with a constant gravitational field. I think you can get away with using mass for weight because of water's buoyancy. But I can't explain the math that supports that argument.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "yQIl0HyqlYg", "cid": "UgzVDrnukPwGFKLpgeB4AaABAg.8ZxmgBwayBh8s_xHhEsrrQ", "comment": "idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
