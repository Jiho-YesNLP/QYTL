Because it is.  50 % is the half (the half of 12 is 6, so 50 % of 12 is 6, just take the number and cut it in half!). You should never have any problems finding out what 50 % is.  10 % is literally a tenth, or easier: it is the decimal point one step to the left (10 % of 50.0 is 5.00, so it's 5!) What's 10 % of 36? It 3.6! That's even easier than 50 %! You should also never have any problems with 10 %!  But now what is 1 % of 36? It's 0.36 (shift the decimal point TWO steps to the left). Also, easy.  So 50 %, 10% and 1 % are a piece of cake. From now on I want you to never have any problems calculating that in your head anymore! And if you think about it, stuff like 5 % (a tenth of the half) or 25 % (the half of the half) are typically just as simple. Imagine 25 % of 700: Well, you halve it (350) and halve it again (175), and voil\u00e1, there you are, 25 % of 700 is 175. What's 5 % of 700 though? Again, you halve it to reach 350, and then you shift the decimal point one step to get to 35. 5 % of 700 is 35. (You can do it the other way as well if that's easier for you, first shifting the decimal point to reach 10 %, then halving it to reach 5 %. Find your way!)  If you understand those simple tasks, you may want to try to understand more complex numbers, because unfortunately most percentages are not that easy.  So that's an easy all-day way for other calculations: 80 % of 20. Okay, make it 10 %, and you know how, just shift the decimal point, 10 % of 20.0 is 2.00. So 10 % is 2. You want 80 %, so just multiply with 8 (because 10 % times 8 is 80 %), 2 times 8 is 16. 80 % of 20 is 16.  60% of 30, again make it 10 % (which would be 3). Now multiply that by 6 (3 times 6 is 18). So 60 % of 30 is 18.  Now you should not just be able to calculate 1 %, 5 %, 10 %, 25 % and 50 %, but also 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and so on! And you guessed it, you can do the same with 2 %, 3 % and the likes: What's 7 % of 90? Make it 1 % (shift the decimal place TWO places) to reach 0.9, then multiply by 7 to reach... well, how do you do that? 9 times 7 is 63, so 0.9 times 7 is 6.3: 7 % of 90 is 6.3, and you can calculate that in your head, I know it.  FOR PROS  When having odd numbers, just approximate them. 27 % of 166? 27 is around 25, which is an easy number to calculate with. It is a quarter. Just quarter 166, or easier cut it in half twice. 166 is also too difficult? Make it 160! 160 quartered is 40 (160 cut in half, 80, again cut in half, 40). So 25 % of 160 is 40, and 27% of 166 should be aroooound 40 as well.  Is that accurate? Well, close enough, 27 % of 166 is actually 44.82. 40 is a good approximation, and if it's in everday use it's close enough, if it's about finances you should obviously be more accurate. But if it's about money you'll use a calculator anyway.  Nother example, 12 % of 628. Okay, 12 % is close to 10%. 628 is close to 630. 10 % of 630 is 63. 12% of 628 should be somewhat close to 63. (It actually is 75.36). It's not extremely close but you are in the right scale. With approximations you're getting a grasp on percentages. You won't always be very close, but you can be relatively close WITHOUT USING A CALCULATOR.  A small advice: It is better to approximate the number instead of the percentage. If accuracy is important, keep it 12 % instead of 10 %, even if 12 % is odd and impractical, because the difference of two small percentage points can be quite high. You know how to calculate 10 % (just a tenth, duh), and you know how to calculate 2 % (it's 1 % times two), so why don't just add them together? It's understandable if you can't do that easily without using pen and paper, but maybe you can. 10 % of 630 is 63, 1 % of 630 is 6.3 (let's round that to 6 because we do it in our heads), 6 times 2 is 12 so 2 % is 12. That means 12 % is 63 plus 12, and that 75... 12 % of 630 is around 75 (actually it's 75.6) and that's strikingly accurate, as we know that 12 % of 628 is 75.36.  So you do have some liberty approximating the base number (you changed 628 to 630), but should try to avoid approximating the percentages (even a slight adjustment from 12 % to 10 % changes the result dramatically).  By the way, what if you approximated the 628 to 600? 10 % of 600 is 60, 1 % is 6, 6 times 2 is 12, 60 plus 12 is 72. So 12 % of 600 is 72. That is astonishingly close to 75.36.  FOR CHEATERS  And if you DO have a calculator at hand (and you should use it if it's about money or other very very important things):  [original number] divided by [100] multiplied by [percentage number]. Easy as that. 12 % of 168 dollars? 168 divided by 100 (now you know what 1 % of 168 is) multiplied by 12 (because you want 1 % exactly 12 times). It's 20 dollars and something.  I know most people tell you to multiply first, but I can understand percentages way better when dividing first. I always UNDERSTAND the result and the steps to it. From my experiance most people do it that way.  Imagine: 3 % of 200: Most people tell you to multiply first, but what is 200 times 3 divided by 100, I don't have a fucking clue. 200 times 3 is 600, I don't even know where I am right now when calculating this. 600 is 300 %, but I can't even imagine 300 %, I don't know what that means. I literally have to learn this formula by heart to use it.  But if I divide first, I get 200 divided by 100 times 3. 200 divided by 100 is 1 %, I know percectly well where I am, I understand every step of the calculation. No matter which number I start with, if I divide it by 100, I'm at 1 %. I know what 1 % is. I know how to work with 1 %. I will ALWAYS be at 1 % if I divide first. But I don't know how to work with 300 %! And next time I want to know 15 % and I end up at 1500 %, then I calculate 33 % and I'm at 3300 %, I always end up at different numbers after the first step, and that's definitely not helping! So better divide it by 100 every single time, so every single time I reach 1 %, and I know perfectly well what to do now. Simply multiplying with 3, and I have 3 %. 1 % 3 times is 3 %, obvious. Easy.  And that's the key, understanding the calculation. That's why I ALWAYS divide first, because I UNDERSTAND that I'm at 1 % right now, I understand what that MEANS, I understand why I multiply it with 3 to reach 3 %. I personally think that students would understand percentages way way better if teachers would teach them to divide first. If you want to know maths, do what the teacher says and learn a formula by heart. If you want to UNDERSTAND maths, do it the way a human actually understand every step, so you don't even need a formula. I don't use a formula when calculating percentages with a calculator. It's common sense how to get to 1 % (dividing by 100), and it's common sense how to get to the percentage you aim for (multiplying that 1 %). Don't do it the other way around!  I mean, think about it, you want to know what 42 % is. Everybody does. You are at 100 %. So how do you go from 100 to 42? You divide your 100 by 100 to get to 1, you multiply 1 with 42 to get to 42. That's the natural way, that's the way our brain understands it. WHY would you multiply first? Don't remember the formula.

You can find 20% of any numbers by just multiplying them by 0.2  You can also find 30% of any numbers by just multiplying them by 0.3  See the pattern here?  If I ask you to find 10% of 100 it mean you need to multiply 100 by 0.1 in order to get the 10% of it.  Also, look at this below: 10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10 = 100  100 is divided by ten parts and each of those parts are 10 which mean 10% of 100 is 10.  If I ask you to find 70% of 20 it mean you need to multiply 20 by 0.7.. and you will get the answer that have the same value as 70% of 20.  Now back to the question.. what is 70% of 20?  Please solve this problem before looking at the answer below:  . .  . .  The answer is 14  Why?  If you divide 20 by 10 parts then you learn that the value of each of those parts are 2. And since I asked you to find 70% of 20, all you gotta do is make seven of 2 and add them all.. what I mean is like this:  2+2+2+2+2+2+2  You can see that there are seven of two being added together.  If you add all the seven of them you will get 14.. And if you check the calculator.. you can see that 14 is the same as 70% of 20.  Remember this... To find the value of each parts of anything you must divide them by 10 parts. Once you learn the value of each of those parts, just add that value multiple time like a repeated addition.. how many time you add the value depends on the percentage the teacher ask you to find.

Simplifying fractions involves dividing both the numerator and denominator by their shared GCD to obtain the simplest form.\r \r In the examples you mentioned, the instructor divided by 20 when expressing 80% as a fraction and by 50 when expressing 50% as a fraction. Although it may seem arbitrary, it was actually an intentional step to find the GCD of the numerator and denominator.\r \r By reducing the fraction, the instructor was essentially finding the largest positive integer that divides both the numerator and denominator without leaving a remainder. This process, referred to as finding the GCD, helps obtain the simplest form of the fraction.\r \r While the instructor didn't explicitly mention the term 'Greatest Common Divisor' (GCD), their intention was to simplify the fractions by dividing by their shared GCD. It would have been helpful if they had explicitly explained this concept, as it can be a key aspect of understanding fraction simplification.\r \r I hope this clarifies the reasoning behind dividing by those specific numbers and sheds some light on the connection between simplifying fractions and finding the GCD.

Then it's an easy matter of dividing 12 by 2 to get 6. (or, I suppose the proper operation would be 1/2 times 12/1 equals 6).  A similar process can be used for the other three operations. It may be easier if you convert each percentage to x/100, where \"x\" is the percentage being used, and then using the reductions mentioned in the video where applicable to get a simpler and easier to understand fraction. FOr instance, with the bottom left operation, \"80% of 20\", you could convert 80% to 80/100. Then, like Dave does at 1:48 or so in the video, divide the fraction by 20 to get 4/5. You then multiply that by 20 which would get you 80/5, which reduces to 16. (if you're wondering how that works, Dave should go over this in a much later video, but the gist is that any whole number-1 or 4 or 20 or 35167- are implied to be over 1; 1/1, 4/1, 20/1, and so on. The top numbers in the operation 4/5 times 20, 4 and 20, are multiplied and the bottom numbers, 5 and 1, are multiplied as well, thus 80/5.)  A potentially easier way (albeit imo slightly longer as far as the mental steps to take) lies with the top right operation. 10% (or 1/10th) of 50 is 5; it's essentially asking what 50/10 is. what you could do is figure out what 10% of any of those numbers are, and then multiply that number by whatever amount it takes to get to the percentage asked for. In the case of 80% of 20, you would ask what 10% of 20 is (20 /10), which is 2. You would then multiply that by 8-because 10 times 8 is 80 and the question is asking for 80%- to get your answer, which is 16. Same with the bottom right. 10% of 30 is 3 (or 30/10) , so we multiply 3 by 6 (6 times 10 is 60) which gets us 18. I hope that helps.
