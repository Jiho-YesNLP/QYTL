The mutated enzyme loses its function, leading to the accumulation of toxic phenylalanine and causing neurological damage. 26:24 \ud83e\uddea Hormonal Mutation: Testicular Feminization Syndrome - Example: Testicular Feminization Syndrome (TFS). - TFS involves an androgen receptor mutation, leading to insensitivity to testosterone. Despite high testosterone levels, individuals with TFS develop a female phenotype. This highlights the role of receptor mutations in gender expression. 30:08 \ud83e\uddec Mutation in Testosterone Biosynthesis - Disease example: Mutation in testosterone biosynthetic enzymes. - Mutations in enzymes involved in testosterone production can result in individuals born phenotypically female with extremely low testosterone levels. Puberty triggers a surge in testosterone, causing a transition from female to male. 34:50 \ud83e\udde0 Neurochemical Signaling and Anxiety - Genetic variation in benzodiazepine receptors. - Variability in benzodiazepine receptor genes contributes to individual differences in anxiety levels. Examining these variations provides insights into the genetic basis of anxiety-related traits across different species. 40:01 \ud83e\uddec Evolutionary Implications of Genetic Changes - Fox P2 gene as an example. - Analysis of the Fox P2 gene demonstrates how single base pair changes, driven by positive selection, can lead to significant evolutionary differences, especially in traits related to communication and language. 47:37 \ud83e\uddec Genetic Relatedness and Evolutionary History - Clarification on genetic relatedness. - Sharing 50% of DNA with siblings and 98% with chimpanzees is not contradictory. The percentage reflects different aspects of genetic relatedness\u2014siblinghood involves shared alleles, while the similarity to chimps highlights evolutionary history. 48:35 \ud83e\uddec Genes and Genetic Similarities - Genes specify traits like antlers, dorsal fins, petals, pistils, and more. - Different species may share genes coding for similar traits, leading to genetic similarities. - The human-chimp genome comparison highlights a 98% similarity in genes coding for similar traits. 50:01 \ud83e\uddec Types of Genes and Variants - Genes can come in different flavors or variants. - Discussion on the diversity of genes and the variations in traits they code for. - Highlighting the importance of understanding different versions of particular genes. 51:28 \ud83e\uddec Evolution, Genetics, and Political Themes - Point mutations and gradual changes lead to genetic advantages in terms of evolution. - Emphasis on the role of competition in the evolution of behavior and species. - Connection between gradualism in evolution and its intertwined political and philosophical implications. 52:26 \ud83d\udcc9 Gradualism vs. Punctuated Equilibrium - Introduction to the punctuated equilibrium model by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldridge. - Gradualism challenged; long periods of stasis punctuated by rapid evolutionary changes. - Exploration of the political themes associated with the two models and their contrasting worldviews. 55:07 \ud83d\udc1a Punctuated Equilibrium and Paleontology - Gould's punctuated equilibrium influenced by paleontology and fossil records. - Gaps in the fossil record lead to the idea of long periods of stasis and sudden evolutionary changes. - The role of paleontologists in tracing evolutionary lineages using fossil records. 56:58 \ud83d\udd17 Molecular Genetics and Gene Structure - Introduction to the modular construction of genes with exons and introns. - Discovery of splicing enzymes and their role in generating different proteins from the same gene. - Implications for tissue-specific gene expression and the combinatorial possibilities of protein variations. 01:07:41 \ud83d\udd0d Combinatorial Possibilities of Gene Expression - Baltimore's insight into the combinatorial possibilities of gene expression. - Discussion on the modular basis of gene construction leading to diverse protein outcomes. - The shift from one gene, one protein, to one gene generating multiple proteins. 01:11:54 \ud83e\uddec Non-Coding DNA and Junk DNA - Discovery of non-coding DNA and the realization that 95% of DNA is non-coding. - Challenges to the notion of \"junk DNA\" and the quest to understand the function of non-coding DNA. - Recognition of the potential significance of non-coding DNA in genetic processes. 01:13:19 \ud83e\uddec DNA Regulation Overview - DNA sequences are not the starting point of the central dogma of life; instead, they serve as the readout under the control of various factors. - 95% of DNA is dedicated to regulating genes, introducing the concept of regulatory sequences upstream from genes. - Promoter and repressor sequences are stretches of DNA coding for switches, influencing the activation or deactivation of gene transcription. 01:15:34 \ud83d\udd04 Transcription Factors and Gene Expression - Transcription factors are molecules, usually proteins, that bind to specific DNA sequences (promoters) and activate or inhibit gene transcription. - Different genes can share the same promoter, leading to the activation of entire networks of proteins with functional similarities. - One gene can have multiple promoters, responding to different signals, allowing for versatile gene activation in various contexts. 01:19:19 \ud83c\udf10 Environmental Regulation of Gene Expression - Gene expression is regulated by environmental factors, either within the cell or from external sources like hormones or chemical messengers. - Environmental signals, such as low energy levels, can activate transcription factors, influencing the transcription of genes related to energy regulation. - Hormones, like testosterone, can travel through the bloodstream and affect gene expression in distant cells, showcasing the impact of external environments. 01:24:33 \ud83d\udd04 Contextual Significance in Gene Expression - The most interesting aspects of DNA lie in the regulation of when genes are turned on or off, not just the properties of the proteins they encode. - Emphasis on the modular ability of one gene to generate diverse proteins based on different contexts, introducing \"if-then\" clauses in gene expression. - Contextual regulation, rather than the protein's intrinsic qualities, adds complexity and richness to understanding genetic information. 01:27:23 \ud83e\uddec Chromatin and Epigenetic Regulation - Chromatin, the structural stabilizer of DNA, plays a crucial role in regulating access to DNA sequences by transcription factors. - Chromatin remodeling, influenced by environmental factors, determines whether transcription factors can access DNA, adding another layer of regulation. - Epigenetics, focusing on heritable changes in gene function not caused by alterations in DNA sequence, introduces the concept that development is all about epigenetics, not just genetics.

Genes code for proteins essential for cellular function.  Genes contain the code for proteins, which are crucial for the structure and function of cells. The sequence of DNA determines the shape and function of proteins, which can have significant effects on bodily processes. Enzymes, a type of protein, are responsible for accelerating reactions and are crucial for many biological processes. The flow of information in life is from DNA to RNA to protein, but this notion is challenged by viruses and retroviruses that can convert RNA information back into DNA.  2. Various genetic mutations can have significant consequences.  Genetic mutations can occur due to various reasons and can have varying consequences, ranging from neutral to disastrous. Point mutations, insertion mutations, and deletion mutations are the three types of mutations. Point mutations occur when one nucleotide is accidentally changed into another, and can result in a neutral mutation or a different amino acid being coded for, depending on which letter is flipped and its location within the triplet. Insertions and deletions tend to have bigger consequences than point mutations. PKU is a common genetic disorder caused by a single-spot point mutation that knocks out an enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine into a safer form, leading to the buildup of phenylalanine and destruction of the nervous system.  3. Genetic mutations impact gender, anxiety, and cultural adaptation.  Genetic mutations impact gender and anxiety, such as conditions like testicular feminization syndrome and benzodiazepine use to treat anxiety. Tiny changes in single base pairs can lead to dramatic diseases and individual variability, and molecular biology intersects with cultural adaptation.  4. Punctuated equilibrium vs gradualism in evolutionary biology.  There is a debate in evolutionary biology between gradualists and punctuated equilibrium supporters, mainly focusing on the speed of evolution and the lack of molecular mechanisms supporting punctuated equilibrium theory. The majority of fossil pedigrees show patterns of punctuated equilibrium (rapid evolutionary change followed by long stasis). However, modern molecular biology provides evidence for such mechanisms, resolving the controversy surrounding punctuated equilibrium.  5. Genetic differences and similarities between humans and chimpanzees.  Humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genes, but have differences in genes coding for specific physical features. Small genetic changes can have a significant impact on evolution over time, tracing evolutionary history, and studying genes such as Fox P2, which is linked to language and communication disorders. The Fox P2 gene has undergone positive selection over the last quarter-million years, resulting in significant changes in its amino acid sequence.  6. Modular gene construction, gene expression, and introns/exons.  Genes consist of separate coding domains called exons, with in-between sections called introns. Splicing enzymes remove introns from RNA and connect exons to form a continuous stretch of DNA, enabling gene expression. This modular structure allows for the creation of different proteins through splicing, generating various protein combinations. Long stretches of non-coding DNA between genes, initially called 'junk DNA', have been found to play important regulatory roles in gene expression. Promoter and repressor sequences code for switches rather than coding for proteins. They bind molecules that interact with the DNA, turning gene transcription on or off, and, consequently, protein generation. Shared promoters and outside regulators activate entire genetic networks, producing multiple proteins with functional similarities.  7. Gene expression regulation and influence of environment.  The environment, both inside and outside the cell, can regulate genetic effects and influence gene expression. Hormones, chemical messengers, and external stimuli can activate transcription factors and regulate protein production. Furthermore, chromatin modeling, methylation, and epigenetics affect gene accessibility and transcription factors. Genes are regulated at multiple levels, and mutations in splicing enzymes, transcription factors, and promoters can significantly impact evolution.

The virus combines with the dna of the cell to replicate it's own dna and feeds off the cell. (Sorry for the poor terminology, I am no virology expert). The \"classic\" vaccine uses the virus directly but makes it weaker. This way the body can fight the disease in a mild form. But in rare cases, with a compromised immune system, the disease can develop. The mRna solves this problem by using only a copy of the mrna of the  virus and no dna. So it is safer. In the past 10 years this technology is being used a lot. This is to say, we should not be surprised that the vaccine interacts with our dna, that's what every vaccine does because it replicates what the virus does. There is a lot of controversy, I understand, but I believe it is more tied to the restrictions we have had imposed on us, and the feeling that we are not being told the complete story (which is often the case, not only when it is about the cov).

Thank you Stanford for making these accessible to the public.  I have always been interested in why people do what they do... I remember when I was about 10, I asked someone why 2 people can have the same experience and respond in such different ways. I was referring to siblings with alcoholic parents- why might one become an alcoholic while the other might stay away from alcohol. Both might say its because their parents were alcoholics that they either followed that path or avoiding it. This kind of thing always intrigued me. Later in college and through research(I never went to high school),  I gained more understanding of biology. Biology fascinates me as well. This lecture series brings the two together seamlessly and holds my attention extremely well.  I have been pondering returning to college to study something in the realm of biology for quite some time.  After getting a concussion early this year, I've become almost obsessed with understanding how this intricate machine we call the human really works. I'm especially interested in how body & mind interplay. How internal is affected by external. How physical is affected by mental, and how mental is affected by biological. This series is filling in some gaps in my understanding & I can't express enough how much I value that. So, thank you again for making this available.

One such discovery is that polymerase is a product of it's own translation, which proves Special Creation. Another is the discovery that the cell's structural design is not generated by genetic information, but is instead passed on by reproduction form the reproductive cells of the parents (Cortical Inheritance/Cytotaxis) which traces back to the original created organism. Evolutionism is a philosophy which is contradicted by science. Over 100 yrs ago, Evolution Theory was plausible for naturalists because of their rejection of God. Biological science was rudimentary and archaic, and provided no information about the operations of the cell. Modern biology has very greatly changed what is known of genetics and biology. It has been discovered that life is based upon information which is digitally encoded and stored in a more compressed form than man's best computer compression schemes. DNA is a material medium encoded with information which is organized to conform to linguistics, possesses algorithmic information processing operations (Dichotomy in the definition of prescriptive information suggests both prescribed data and prescribed algorithms: biosemiotics applications in genomic systems, David J D\u2019Onofrio, David L Abel and Donald E Johnson, Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, 2012), and the human language properties of phonetics, semantics, punctuation, syntax, grammar, and aprobetics, all of which have been discovered to be more complex that the properties of human spoken languages (Complex grammar of the genomic language, published in the journal Nature, November 9, 2015, Karolinska Institutet). The information input and output processing of DNA includes the analytical operations of proofreading, information comparison, cut, insert, copy-and-past, backup, and restore, all of which operate by algorithmic operations. There is no potential for the material actions of chemistry to produce information, algorithms, and linguistics. They are non-physical fundamental entities that can only be produced by intelligence. This fact is proof that all life was designed by a mind of supreme intelligence. Because of this and many other biological discoveries, it has been overwhelmingly demonstrated that evolution is impossible and creation is a scientific fact. DNA is a 4-dimensional (3 dimensions+time) operating system which is far more complex than man's computer software technology, posessing many thousands of information hierarchies and pathways in the cell. When the DNA molecule is supercoiled as chromatin, some of it's information is available to the cell which is not available when the molecule is uncoiled, and when it is not supercoiled, some of it's information is available to the cell which is not available when it is supercoiled. DNA is a dual-directional information package, providing different information depending upon which strand and direction the transcription machinery of the cell is traveling. Man does not know how to to write computer software that can be read both forward and backwards to provide separate information processes and functionality. It is beyond our ability. DNA's individual information sequences are overlapping and nested sharing nucleotides between sequences, and information in different locations of the molecule are interdependent with each other, even when separated by hundreds or thousands of base pairs in distance from each other - a feature which exemplifies why chemical processes cannot design DNA. DNA possesses codes built upon codes which regulate the use of each other, even when they are distant from each other in the molecule. Genetic algorithms and information possess forward-thinking properties, which nature is incapable of producing because molecules are not sentient. During an organism's development, the genetic information instructs the cell on how to turn on and off, like chemical switches, many sequences of information of the DNA in a supremely complex and yet to be understood orchestral arrangement of various groupings and orders so as to build the structures of the organism over time. These patterns of genes being switched on and off is so complex that man will likely never be able to decipher it. If you want to believe in evolution because you refuse to acknowledge the existence of our creator, nobody can stop you. But doing so is to be a denialists of the discoveries of modern science because the truth is uncomfortable, and to continue to believe things which the outdated concept of Charles Darwin over 150 yrs ago could not have predicted. Believing in evolution today is as antiquated as it was to believe that flies arose from meat, or that frogs arose from mud a century prior to Darwin.  Eugenie Scott, a militant anti-creationist and promoter of evolutionism has stated, \"If your local campus Christian fellowship asks you to \"defend evolution,\" please decline. Public debates rarely change many minds; creationists stage them mainly in the hope of drawing large sympathetic audiences. Have you ever watched the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Federals? The Federals get off some good shots, but who remembers them? The purpose of the game is to see the Globetrotters beat the other team. And you probably will get beaten.\" Atheists in fact hate the Scientific Method and refuse to employ it. The most agregious example is the scientific knowledge of the effects of random genetic mutation. Random genetic mutation experimentation has been conducted for over 80 years. Over one million studies have been concluded, and they have provided consistent results demonstrating that random mutations are destructive and have negative effects upon organisms, both biochemically and anatomically, and do not add anything useful to the physiology of any organism, not even incrementally. What do we therefore conclude? We must conclude that mutation cannot be a mechanism for accruing change that results in macroevolution. But what does the atheist conclude despite such a massive body of evidence? They continue to claim that random mutation IS a mechanism for accruing change that results in mind-bending complexity, microscopic interdependent machinery, and macroevolution. They do this not because of science, but because their worldview requires it to be, since if evolution were true, random mutation would have to be the base mechanism for evolution since genetic information prescribes the features of organisms. In this way, they refuse to come to the correct conclusion because of their paradigm, tossing out the Scientific Method and the conclusion it would require them to accept.", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "Ugw_OR5OHqnaf35q32R4AaABAg", "comment": "His behavior is very anxious .", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "Ugwq-ekPit2Y-JPVdjF4AaABAg", "comment": "Can someone please share the entire playlist", "votes": "1", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "UgzEYy_AuN7L1TfxmgR4AaABAg", "comment": "I need me a \"show me the genes\" T shirt", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "UgwQTVfINX6N6mZzMCl4AaABAg", "comment": "Damn, these lectures have made me rediscover how much I love learning.

It's not testosterone deficiency that is causing this condition. It's deficiency (lack of) dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that is causing these people (guevedoces) to be born as girls, who then turn into boys. DHT can be regarded as a far more potent androgen (\"male\" hormone) than testosterone. It's so potent, it's what causes the development of the penis, while the child is still in the womb. No DHT; no penis until puberty.  These guevedoces have a lot of testosterone, in fact. Although insignificant, they actually have slightly more testosterone than the average boy, because they lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to DHT.

Consider this thought: Neurological rewirings are the essential beginning points of cancer strings, being response activities of transposable neural progenitor cells commanding micromutations that work toward short term \"blue prints\" for single punctuated equilibrium moments in evolution, if successful.  It is funny what makes sense in evolution if you consider health science and medical disasters as  potential gene, mitochondria, and protein development points in the process of gradual to rapid changes. Does that sound much like what a \"half an eyeball\" would look like, that evolution is a miserable experience, not a magical fairytale? Add in the thought process that that evolutionary process begins in nutrition, environmental/chemical introductions to biology, and microbiological evolutions occurring a little more rapidly, and it may be a situation where new genetics are always the killing off of the old genetics where the hosts who struggle through the evolutionary processes have it worse in sickness and health complications than those who are born with the completed genes after the number of generations who live with the shortened lifespans.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "UgzqHuVmHDVxNtXmkEp4AaABAg", "comment": "Ross is a paleontologist too.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "UgzI55CMjt7yOg1A_MF4AaABAg", "comment": "It's incredible how he's so informed on so many different fields of study thus allowing him to explain human behavior from the micro to the macro with ease", "votes": "55", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_dRXA1_e30o", "cid": "UgybEIUkwHmiHmua5dN4AaABAg", "comment": "It's fascinating how DNA is in many ways similar to an artificially created computer program.

More and more cosmic radiation is going to be impacting the Earth this century. (Hence, more QED and QCD interactions occurring). (And this is due to in part: 1. The Earth's magnetic field weakening, thus allowing more cosmic radiation energy to reach the surface of this Earth.  Currently projected to be at it's lowest around 2035, just 17 years from now. 2. The Sun going into grand solar minimum, projected to be at it's lowest around 2075 - 2080.  Losing some of the Sun's protective shield will allow more cosmic radiation energy to reach this Earth. 3. Our solar system is supposedly moving into an area of the galaxy without a 'dust cloud' protection, thus allowing more cosmic radiation energy to reach this solar system.)  b.  While this cosmic radiation energy increase might seriously contribute to the 6th mass extinction event that has already started on this Earth, it might also contribute to the next jump in evolution of species.  c. Basically, as dark colors absorb energy while light colors reflect energy, AND as a women supposedly has all the eggs in them that they will ever have from birth, AND how electromagnetic radiation energy is stronger at the equator where a large percentage of new species are discovered, THEN while evolution could potentially occur basically anywhere, it has a higher probability of occurring to a dark skinned colored woman that has lived possibly their whole child bearing years along the equator.

As fetuses, male testes release testosterone which activates the Wolffian ducts (mesonephric ducts) to form male internal genitalia. Additionally, this testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (more active form) to form male external genatalia.
