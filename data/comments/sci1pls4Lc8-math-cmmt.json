I prefer to use W instead of U, when both integration by parts and U-substitution are part of the same problem.  It is not the same thing as algebraic substitution, but the term substitution means the same thing in both of these terms.  Ultimately what it means, is if you can recognize an integrand that is likely the result of a differentiation through the chain rule, then you can switch the variable of integration, to a variable that represents the inside of a function.   Suppose your integrand is a product of g'(x), and the composition of functions f(g(x)).   The g'(x) term might not strictly be the derivative of g(x), but rather you might have to multiply by a constant to get g'(x).   In that case, you multiply by 1 in a fancy way, as a constant divided by itself.  Part of that ratio becomes the constant you need in order to complete g'(x) to be, and the other part of that ratio, becomes a leading constant of the entire integral, that you pull out in front.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sci1pls4Lc8", "cid": "UgwUBuWSb0VN-8Sbxt94AaABAg.9Nn9vtX2Y_q9YULcnmw1xw", "comment": "\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 Didn't even give you a thank you.
