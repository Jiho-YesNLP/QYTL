The question having Aluminum,Iron and Water... There's a mistake behind his approach. The Element with the highest temp will lose heat to the others with low temp. Simply put... Aluminum at 120\u00b0c will lose heat to Iron metal at 90\u00b0c and water at 15\u00b0c cos the Conservation law of heat says that heat will flow from the higher region to the lower.  Asides that....
