Know that  before you start trying to solve x, you have to get the absolute value by itself. Example: |2x +8| -2 = 14 becomes |2x +8| = 16. Now from here you have to split it into two equations, |2x +8| = 16 and |2x +8| = -16. From here you can just simply solve it like before.

Substituting -(2x + 8) for |2x + 8|, we have -(2x + 8) - 2 = 14.  To solve this equation, we simplify it step by step:  * Distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses: -2x - 8 - 2 = 14. * Combine like terms: -2x - 10 = 14. * Add 10 to both sides to isolate the variable term: -2x = 24. * Finally, divide both sides by -2 to solve for x: x = -12.", "votes": "6", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Wirk4o3FHPA", "cid": "UgzeKwHYl3cQ17E_vz94AaABAg", "comment": "Hey Prof. Thank you for the work you do, very much appreciated.
