Now I can't seem to find the answer, though that's probably due to my lackluster Google-fu skillz. Anywho, as I understand it the easiest to combat the magnetic fields generated by wires with roughly equal currents traveling in opposite directions is to have them wound together. The currents create opposing magnetic fields at nearly the same location, which results in  essentially no magnetic field being generated. What I'm unsure of is where the energy those magnetic fields goes. Are the wires respective magnetic fields still created its just that due to their proximity the field lines are highly concentrated between the two? Does that just lead to an elecromotive force in conductors in opposition to their currents and increase their resistance? Moreover does that lead to  additional heating of the wire/ noise in any signal? Do they simply cancel one another out completely so the energy never dissipates from the current? Is it lost in some other way ie. ultralow frequency radio waves? Or am I actually as dumb as I'm feelin and have missed something blatantly obvious?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8T_dP7Oq620", "cid": "UgzHBGwLq6r005BvYRB4AaABAg", "comment": "this man does everything lol", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8T_dP7Oq620", "cid": "Ugzc6G84KvcmDdAx7jh4AaABAg", "comment": "You said 'right hand rule.

Now what you gonna do? It is arrow will be pointing to the left while your B wire's arrow will be pointing to the right? CONFUSING AS HELL.  The thing is, in every other areas,  forces are always viewed as push force, not pull. A force is always exerted on things has the mental picture of pushing.  The magnetic force is the only place that the arrows direction is not a push force but a pull force. When you see an arrow pointing at something, it is not pushing on it, it means pulling on it.

You could do the opposite of his equation and it would look like this: F = i1 * L * B <--- 'B' being the magnetic field from wire 2 at wire 1's distance away.
