Is your child having difficulty in math and physics, or worse flunked a subject? Then, that's your fault as a parent.   There's no valid reason anymore for students to flunk math, chemistry and physics!!! As parents, your obligation is to share these links to them.   Do you have children or relatives or friends in grade 7, 8\u00a0 9, 10, 11, 12 or 1st year & 2nd year college, all the way to 5th year? No reason they will flunk anymore.   I was an engineering professor before, and I tell you these videos are the best preparation any high school or college student could have.   (If you're a teacher, share this with students and your class will improve immediately!!)   You don't need a teacher or a tutor anymore. These videos will guide your student into becoming a Summa Cum Laude.   Why? Because if you can understand math and physics, you can understand any topic such as political science or business management easily. Therefore, Summa Cum Laude.   Let them watch these videos in advance, and repeat over and over again.    Here are links to videos that will make them number 1 in the classroom for chemistry, math,\u00a0 & physics   Note: These are YouTube Playlists, meaning, each link has many videos in each; some with 300 videos per link.

(TIME is thoroughly consistent with what is gravity ON/IN BALANCE.) WHAT IS E=MC2 is dimensionally consistent. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma.  Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). CLEAR water comes from what is THE EYE. INDEED, consider what is (essentially and necessarily) BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE !!! Lava IS orange, AND it is even blood red. The hottest flame is blue. The hottest lava is yellow. LOOK upwards, ON BALANCE, at what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky !! The orange (AND setting) Sun IS the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE !! NOW, consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE. (BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.) WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma, AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution.  WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. c squared CLEARLY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. WHAT IS GRAVITY is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked (ON BALANCE) !!! E=MC2 is consistent with/AS WHAT IS GRAVITY, AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution. Magnificent. Notice that the curvature or shape of said Moon matches that of what is THE EARTH/ground (that is, given what is a CLEAR horizon, of course.) The diameter of WHAT IS THE MOON IS about ONE QUARTER that of WHAT IS THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. Excellent !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE. Consistent WITH WHAT IS TIME, WHAT IS E=MC2 IS GRAVITY ON BALANCE. Finally, the average ocean tide is about 6 feet; AND said Sun manifests or forms at what is EYE LEVEL/BODY HEIGHT. The tidal range on the open ocean is about 3 feet. Notice, what is THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE ON BALANCE. Outstanding. Again, ON BALANCE, consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE. The BULK DENSITY of WHAT IS THE MOON is comparable to that of (volcanic) basaltic lavas on THE EARTH/ground. The surface of WHAT IS THE MOON is chiefly composed of pumice. Excellent. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE), AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma.

So you could use Khan Academy's or Chadsprep's free Chemistry courses on their site or YT channel, alternatively you can use UC Irvine's and MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on Chemistry which goes even to Graduate level stuff, they all offer hundreds of videos in the Chemistry topic and are so far the best resource I've found for videos. You can use The Organic Chemistry Tutor's playlists to explain some harder stuff in a quick way, like difficult reactions or topics where you already know the theory behind it and you just want to make calculations. Then you can learn about Organic Chemistry and the reactions that can happen, learn about a little bit of quantum chemistry etc. You can use your knowledge in Organic Chemistry to either go for studies in the Biochemical field or Physical Chemistry, perhaps if you want to know how different materials can be used and what their properties are, or continue your studies in Inorganic Chemistry.   Personally I don't have any experience with Physical Chemistry, but yeah. If you want a free, open-source textbook then you can use Libretexts for any field, even Engineering. Somewhere along the way you can take MIT 3.091SC Solid State Chemistry to learn things like how transistors and conductance/electric current work, as well as crystallography. If you want to make experiments, you'll want to get a lab manual for experiments and then start off buying compounds and utensils for them, just make sure to follow the safety guides and know exactly what compounds you're working with.
