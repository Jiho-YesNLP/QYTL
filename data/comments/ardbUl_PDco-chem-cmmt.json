Couldn't you have used concentration(H+) = [moles(H+) = moles (HN03)] divided by volume of H20 and plugged that answer into the -log (concentration of H+) equation? It gives the exact same answer and didn't require conversion of volume of H20 into Kg.", "votes": "1", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ardbUl_PDco", "cid": "UgjlXms_hGnJy3gCoAEC", "comment": "Hi. \u00a0Thanks for your videos. \u00a0I have a question about Molarity. \u00a0You calculated it as mol/kg, but I thought that was molality. \u00a0Which one are we supposed to use?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ardbUl_PDco", "cid": "Ugh5AvR0PTJ-cHgCoAEC.8Ai0uuUklUX8CRIDG2GUQM", "comment": "+LONDHE93 Yeah he did a mistake.
