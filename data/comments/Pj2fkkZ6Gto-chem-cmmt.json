What you are learning are the basics which is taught in any general chemistry or honors chemistry course in high school. This is physical chemistry or specifically the quantum chemistry introduction. The work the students have to do involves solving the Schrodinger equation and computing expectation values/uncertainties of measurements. The requirements to take this class vary from university to university but the requirements are generally calculus II or calculus III. However, to really interpret and understand results it is generally recommended to have linear algebra and ordinary differential equations taken. Even that may not be enough math to really get into the complexities that come from these equations.   http://pollux.chem.umn.edu/4502/3502_HWkey4.pdf  This is likely closer to the type of problems they would be asked to solve on homework sets and exams.
