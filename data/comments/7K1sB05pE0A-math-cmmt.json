But you if you want a intuitive/deep understanding you can watch the lecture (you will also have to study from the given book too bcz lectures are not enough for complete understanding).You will eventually study this in first year of your Btech.So, my advice would be to first finish up JEE content of calculus and then jump to this for better understanding.

For example consider f(x)=x\u00b2 to find gradient simply do f(5)-f(4) or anything like that as long it is f(x)-f(x-1).. In this example we will get 25-16=9 So the gradient of the tangent line that intersects x=4 and x=5 is 9.. If you use differentiation f'(x)=2x+c Let say you neglect c for a second.. And plug into the formula At f'(5)=2(5) Which is equivalent to 10 But this is incorrect..the correct value is 9 so now we know c=-dx So if you want to find gradient between two units of x you get c=-2 which means f'(x)=2x-2 So I don't think finding the gradient between two units of x is relevant and so why not just use f(x)-f(x-1) to find the gradient when x only incremented by one unit not more and not less", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7K1sB05pE0A", "cid": "UgzfqhHHmE_iWh_pww54AaABAg", "comment": "meanwhile in Brazil, public and private universities retain knowledge as if it belonged to them.... you are wrong, knowledge belongs to society.... this is the big difference between slavery and freedom.... long live the united states of America.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7K1sB05pE0A", "cid": "UgzY6vBNdnGauA_a7qx4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks Prof. David Jerison and off course MIT and American society for this amazing science dissemination!!!

The x-intercept (i.e., y=0) and y-intercept (i.e., x = 0) are relevant to the tangent line . The function itself doesn't have an x or y intercept (because as x \u2192 0, y \u2192 \u221e and vice-versa).  The tangent line, however, is a straight line. Like all straight lines it has a formula of the form   y = mx + c  Where  c is the y-intercept,  m is the gradient, and  -c/m is the x-intercept.  The formula for a straight line describes a locus of points that satisfy the formula. That's a way of saying that it gives pairs of (x,y) values that 'fit' when you put them in the formula.  Think of 'y' as the 'output' and 'x' as the 'input'.  Straight lines always give a unique value for output y for any given input x - they are '1-to-1'.   They are also invertible , so they can tell you what the input was if you have a known output .   This gives lines some nice characteristics: you can get the formula for the line if you can find \u2460 any two points that lie on the line; OR \u2461 one point on the line plus the slope of the line.  In this example, we have one point (X0,Y0) and the slope (1/X0)^2 which gives us enough information to 'characterise' the line.  The terms \"Y intercept where X =0\" and \"X intercept where Y = 0\" were drilled into our heads in grade 9; the formula for, and graphical representation of, a straight line is literally the first example used when kiddies transition from \"plain old algebra' to 'introductory linear algebra'. From there it was on to conic sections (parabola, hyperbola, ellipse, circle).  That used to happen in grade 9 in Australia: it was part of the curriculum the year before kids got 'streamed' into specialist mathematics (e.g., trig, calculus etc). I guess in the US it probably happens some time in grade 11 or so.  (inb4 some douchenozzle makes reference to non-Cartesian representations, or to complex numbers.

When written like this, we see that there is only one variable: x. A multi variable function would be f(x, y) = z (read f of x and y is equal to z). In this case, variables x and y are used in the function.   Since we are trying to find the tangent line, we need the slope of the tangent line. Slope uses (delta y)/(delta x), or the change in y over a change in x. This necessarily implies that we have an x0 (x point we are trying to find the tangent line at) y0 (y point we are trying to find the tangent line at) x1 (a value very very close to x0) and y1 (the value of the function at x1). The x and y variables are just to help make everything named. So, there is ONE variable, x, which we can have two distinct versions of. One is fixed and the other comes arbitrarily close to it.

That will cover a wide range of topics, from what might be called 'advanced algebra' (but not abstract algebra) to trigonometry, plus conic sections, and an introduction of the limit concept and perhaps methods for calculating limits of different kinds of functions. That last bit is usually covered at the beginning of college calculus after a quick review of some important notions about algebra and functions; however, it appears that at MIT, they assume you have that background and start talking about limits as if students already are familiar with them (I'm basing that on what I see in this first video).   American precalculus texts also contain lots of topics you do NOT need for calculus (e.g., probability, linear programming, etc.) so it would not be necessary to go through every chapter and section. I think when I took precalculus in the early '80s, I used Swokowski, but the book I taught from was by Larson & Hostetler, and they also wrote the calculus text I learned from originally. However, there are so many books to choose from for both precalculus and basic calculus that I won't attempt to mention more: anything you can get your hands on will likely work reasonably well. If this were an honors calculus/ introduction to analysis course, you'd need a more rigorous textbook, and again, there are many, many to choose from at varying degrees of austerity and rigor.   If your algebra and trigonometry background is solid and you're finding the concepts in this first lecture confusing, my bet would be that it's the limit concept that is the sticking point. And that's not surprising. Even a non-rigorous understanding of what's going on here takes multiple encounters. I know math professors at the University of Michigan who say that they felt that they didn't really understand calculus until they taught it as graduate students or post-doctoral instructors. There are subtleties at work even in this introductory lecture that might take a few years to \"get,\" though it is not necessary to \"get\" them deeply in order to be able to DO calculus. As he says in the lecture, calculus is easy, but it gets conflated with things that aren't so easy and the combination of the easy with the hard makes the average person feel only that calculus is very difficult. In the beginning, make sure that your algebra and trigonometry knowledge is sound, review your understanding of basic pre-algebra things like manipulating and calculating with fractions, and then go over material on limits. Then review the geometric argument he makes in the beginning, make sure that's clear to you, and come back to the analytic argument (where he starts putting things in terms of general points, values of a given function at a given point, and the changes in the inputs (x values) and outputs (f(x)'s).   Eventually, you should start to get used to these \"difference equations\" as general ways to find derivatives for various kinds of functions, but then you will learn a bunch of very simple procedures such that it won't be necessary to go through all of that in order to find derivatives of polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and so on. So it really does get easier (at least for a while).   But the limiting concept will keep coming up, so be willing to return to it again and again.

Load and run once a week for an hour for around a year, and you'll have a working knowledge of it for the long term.   In addition, making the program will help solidify the knowledge all by itself, as in the program's creation you are learning by teaching. This is what I use my retro computers for quite often. It's a fun way to interact with my computer collection in an extremely useful way.
