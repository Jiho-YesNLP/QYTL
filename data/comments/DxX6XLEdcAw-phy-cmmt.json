Now, I am assuming, of course, that it doesn't, but I'm not sure why.  If I put a butterfly valve on a pipe, I can regulate the volume flow in the pipe.  As I slowly close the the butterfly valve, the volume flow rate decreases on the downstream side of the valve.  It seems that slowly closing a butterfly valve is basically equivalent to decreasing the diameter of the pipe, so I would expect a higher speed but an equivalent volume flow rate.
