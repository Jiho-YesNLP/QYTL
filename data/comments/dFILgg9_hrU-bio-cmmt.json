The camera never moves to where our Incredibly Learned Professor shows his drawings or slides. We have to imagine the foxes. The camera is resolutely and automatically focused on his beard, and will never move from that point. It seems firmly set to move only on the horizontal plane, with tight limits on the right side, which again does not reach any view too far right. Second point. There's an enormous amount of stuff in this lecture. Don't imagine that watching this video alone will give you an immediate understanding of the various points. No way, you get a flavor, a summary, a capsule, enough to titillate your interest and keep you awake, a terse survey of the salient points and facts.  We don't have access to the papers and reading material distributed to the class students, and no reading list either is added to the video as a post-scriptum.

If it for example comes to animals with a big population spread across a big are, then it is of course naturally that evolution goes slow. But if you have a small isolated group of animals, then i have no problem to see how evolution can go in steps, where some changes happen relatively fast.  But i am aware that with no education in this, it is easy to kind of make it more simple then it is, so i don`t know anything and can only guess. Still again and again historically we have seen scientist argue with each other over things, and very often it turns out that a combination of what both say is often more correct then what any of them alone say.  This is a joke, but i must ask anyway. Is it mandatory among the different branch of science to first of all learn that your science is the only serious science?

So I don't think this is about beliefs, but rather, it's about looking critically at an issue in a number of ways. This is one of the ways he teaches his students to keep an open mind and not just accept something as gospel. If you have a theory that you think fits better, by all means, test it experimentally, publish the result and show all the other theories wrong. That's how we tend to do most science. I'm curious what kind of questions you'd be asking him that would leave him \"stumped\". If they would be questions about biology and behaviour, it would surprise me if they did in fact leave him stumped, seeing as he is someone that has studied biology all his life and behavioural biology especially is his domain of expertise.

If you're wondering whether scientific theories are just based on the personal beliefs of some scientist or another, then you don't know what a scientific theory actually is, nor do you know the method by which a theory is arrived at(the scientific one).

The gravity test would need to be done to prove or disprove that portion of the TOE, and the gravity test will speak for itself.  It will either be true or it will not be true.  Here is a copy and paste from my files:  Revised TOE: 3/25/2017a. My Current TOE:  THE SETUP: 1. Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism. 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.). 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them. 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them. 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.  FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO: 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field. 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field. 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality. 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons. 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary. 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks. 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.  THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA: 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc. 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe. 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe. 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate. 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure. 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).  THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY: 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up. 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency. 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.  NOTES: 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other. 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other. 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well. 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true. 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?  DISCLAIMER: 27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.  ________________________________________________________________  Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.  a. Imagine a 12 hour clock. b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions. c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions. (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.) d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields. e. Do this with the em fields on and off. (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.) f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects. (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)  (An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)  'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done. 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what 'gravity' was not, which is still something in the scientific world.

It goes beyond any quantum field theory formulas that I am currently aware of.  The outline though is basically as follows:  The formula has at least 3 levels to it: 1. The Internal Photon Level:  The 3 interacting forces, (which might even be just a singular force with 3 different modalities), all interacting at basically 90 degrees to each other and all simultaneously pulsating and swirling.  A complex part of the formula but I believe to be totally doable.  2. The External Photon Level:  For each pulsating, swirling photon, all the pulsating, swirling photons interacting with it.  An exponential part of the formula that I am not even sure modern day super computers could adequately handle.  3. The Inter-dimensional Photon Level:  For each modality within each photon would have an energy frequency associated with it.  The energy frequencies could be seen as being in their own space time dimension.  (For me, 'space' is energy itself of which is the 'gem' photon and 'time' is the flow of energy; 'temperature' is the interaction of energy), so one would be dealing with way more than just 3 spatial dimensions and way more than just 1 time dimension (as there would many different energy frequencies with many different flows of energy).  Whenever like resonate energy frequencies resonated with each other, they would affect each other, kind of like 'spooky action at a distance'.  Anytime energy frequencies overlapped, there would be a temporary spike of some sort in each space time dimension.  In addition, if in reality the 'gem' photon is just a singular force with 3 different modalities, it's possible that energy could 'slip' between modalities which would also affect the results.  A very complex part of the formula on top of all the complexity that came before it.  4. Any time any energy moved in the system, the entire formula would have to be recalculated due to potential ripple effects.  Like I said above, I don't even believe the mathematics exists yet for what I am trying to do, but at a minimum, the formula would contain the above levels the way I currently see it to be.  ____________________________________________________________________________  'IF' my latest TOE idea is really true, (and I fully acknowledge the 'if' at this time), that the pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon is the energy unit of this universe that makes up everything in existence in this universe, and what is called 'gravity' is a part of what is currently recognized as the 'em' photon, then the oscillation of these 3 interacting modalities of the energy unit would be as follows:  Gravity: Maximum in one direction, Neutral, Maximum in the other direction; Electrical: Maximum in one direction, Neutral, Maximum in the other direction; Magnetic: Maximum in one direction, Neutral, Maximum in the other direction.  Then: 1 singular energy unit, with 3 different modalities, with 6 maximum most reactive positions, with 9 total basic reactive positions (neutrals included).  Hence 1, 3, 6, 9 being very prominent numbers in this universe and why mathematics even works in this universe.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dFILgg9_hrU", "cid": "UgzwjXaq162sPMxY90h4AaABAg.8mKrchA8FUk9DxeXCAYVQX", "comment": "Yes.

Or cuckolding strategy to bring more copies of your genes into the next generation? The more I study, the more I realize that there's no such thing as love, soul, good and evil. The problem is that people are afraid to let go of their superstitions as they feel it lowers them on the social dominance hierarchy. In other words they 'believe' what everybody else is saying to be part of a particular dominance hierarchy. When the science is reviewed these egocentric illusions dissipate into behavioral biology. I also believe that psychology is outdated. We're not talking about something 'immaterial'. The psyche is the interaction between the nervous system and environmental impulses. Is there really such a thing as progress? Or is that just another bias? What else is their beyond the proliferation of life? Immortality? Is life really a game to win? What exactly are you cheating when you fornicate polygamously? Empty hollow promises of dedication to affection for one specific individual member of a species? What is this 'you' that's so special to be bound to eternally? I believe we make more of existence then it truly is. That we delude ourselves as a result of our evolved intelligence. In a, it doesn't matter how you fill in the gaps as long as you fill in the gaps, kind of way. It's the same locomotor action patterns of behaviors only projected on a bigger scale of abstraction.

'I', is a social construct. A way of measurement. It means nothing more then that. In other words, the ego delusion is a way for the ego to deny it's inevitable oblivion.

In a geologically small amount of time even single point mutations have completely taken over species via natural selection.

If you look beyond the fantasy of religion there is deep meaning. Another thing that people like Isaac Newton found interesting about religion is how math is seemingly encoded. I dont know how much it shows in his most famous work but newton spent way more time trying to decipher the bible through math than worry about planets orbiting. Btw, it would make sense for the bible to have math encoded. Before writing and literacy the only way information could be passed is orally, through drawings, and through structures that were built with information about their culture encoded in the form of statues, and possibly information encoded in the dimensions of the thing. Early mathematical thinking didnt have the hindu-arabic numeral system so even great greek mathematicians would be puzzled if you showed him simple arithmetic without any explanation. What if knowledge of mathematics or other stuff is encoded in the ancient stories that are todays religions predescessors? What if too many monkey humans are too dumb to even read it, where does it mention that an anglosaxon with dove wings is what an angel is? Most so called christians are not familiar with the bible, preachers exist to decipher it for the average monkey but while many preachers are good people who understand and have good intent, corruption leaks into everything humans touch.   The tl;dr is this - religions arent inherently stupid, people are inherently stupid.

There is now no known human characteristic which is not shared to some small extent by other species. Our particular problem is that we have invaded most of the earth's ecosystems, and have developed medical technologies that have up to the present allowed us to overbloom. More human effort has gone into protecting our Malthusian overreproduction at the expense of all other life, than is wise. Even the television is filled with ads to save all babies, save all immigration, build and develop.  Contrary to Stanford's thrust, there is good news in the seemingly increasing rate of evolution of numerous viruses, bacteria, and other parasites which could help limit our species before we take down vertebrate life altogether. Since no other multicellular creature can stand before our onslaught, it is up to the fast-reproducing organisms to catch up evolutionarily to our excess. We have NEVER departed from what critics have called the ideology of the cancer cell; never departed from the practices of bacteria or other organisms released into new environments: they overbloom until they poison themselves or wipe out food sources.  ALL species surpass their food sources at times, but only humans and Orcas have changed their food sourcee, eating down the food chain, to my knowledge.

He was CDC, either Kamran Khan or A S Khan) and discussing only the modern human vectoring due to air travel - NOT suggesting populatino control or reduction.  A basic tenet of human vectoring has long been known to be well-connected populations of 250,000 or so. By this I mean intimately, as in urban areas, or quickly, as in mobile dispersion of vectors - like the few SARS-infected that hit Toronto from China back when. Any discussion thus has to use ecological modeling.  I may have said somewhere that 3rd cousins tend to favor the most retention of adaptive traits with a low enough incidence of maladaptive alleles.  I'd bet that the cousin marriage antedates Islam, as many other cultural traits now condemned as Islamic are South/Southwest Asian and more ancient. Islam just incorporates and institutionalizes these. Notice that Catholic dogma has long prohibited marriage of relatives closer than 4th cousins. \u00a0 Europe has long been invaded by waves of immigrants - genetics show that agrarian neolithic expansion - 9000-3700 BP, leaving only isolated islands of original hunter-gatherers. The Neandertal females who mixed with Western Eurasia long preceded this, and the steppe peoples who moved west, whether through the Mideaast also saw the Northern Europeans moving down the Volga. All this mix of periodic mixing and relative sedentism through specious tribal nationalism until the 20th c. did keep that population strong in allelic variation.  My history overview is kind of moot, though, as human populations have not shown highly significant differences in resistance to novel diseases.  Because I'm interested in psychological characteristics like memory, (implicit and explicit - loads of new neurological work is just coming out even this month!) I have watched how the world's media affects people (you have seen my own misanthropy concerning human persistence in growth economies and ths institutional (govt AND religion) support of excess growth) and their perceptions . I have generalized my comments using such knowns as self-interest bias, availability, representativeness, stereotyping and other psychological heuristics; human declarative memory seems less developed in very recent times when we look at internet comment.  Islam and other religious dogma seems purposed to reinforce heuristics and biases. Perhaps the reason why no one is learning from experience, the great documentation of history, OR certain highly useful tribal taboos, has to do with the extreme mixing that is occurring.  \u00a0I suspect that the present half-century of violent clashing rhetoric is rearranging humans, and that the reformation of isolated communities within large societies will affect epidemiology - the variable resistance and emergence of novel disease experiment is in its early stages.  Public rhetoric still involves the massive inaccuracies of belief: that religion, national constitutions, skin color, or other fluxes have intrinsic meaning. The real meaning appears to be the formation\u00a0 of past enclaves, and of new mixtures, as nonconscious experiment.  I do some work for other species and am concerned with relatively unexploited ecosystems, as the present experiment we're looking at is threatening an entirely different aspect of the biosphere than most contending and mixing humans are noticing. Discussion of necessary ecosystem diversity is ignored in practice, even as it is paid lip service by new economists, politicians,and even new religious voices like pope Francis.  So, it's possible that crowd diseases of monocrops will accelerate, as well as human crowd disease. Should virology and epidemiological science keep up, I suspect that faster, more easily proliferating vectors will increase as well. Viruses have not so far been so pushed toward atmospheric transmission.  Most people do not know how many types of bacteria live in the atmosphere, nor what happens to bacteria when viruses attack them. They are also selected, and if we take the analogy of cholera, Vibrio species were not deadly to humans until human numbers affected them in estuaries enough to create blooms which were then attacked by viruses (crowd diseases for bacteria!).

Check Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work - it's a basis for all the heuristics and biases defined by psychologists.  Notice that common sense here can differ from critical thinking. Heuristics have value in that they keep you out of trouble. that's why deer and bears move away from me when they see me, even though they are both fast and agile, and both, especially the bear, could really work me over. It's safer for them, although a mama bear might recognize that squashing the possible threat to her children is more  worthy.  So, we're built to both use generalizations and to learn from experience. Critical thinking does have to do with representativeness. If chewing on this plant nearly killed me, that plant that looks very like it is not for lunch.  So. Taboo is a french spelling of Polynesian word. In Hawaii, you will find Kapu signs in yards - the same word heard slightly differently by English missionaries. It means \"keep out.\" things are sacred sometimes because strangers just take meaningful or needed things. Here's a useful taboo: The Dine' or Navajo will not retain a lodge in which someone has died. They burn them. If you've heard of Hantavirus, you know that it is passed through rodent poop. So, the deadly disease, with long historical presence in the Southwest, stops with the dying of the individual, rather than continues to affect people who might remain in the stick house.  This tradition of preventing mysterious death by abandoning the lodge and ending the infection was so useful that Euroamerican medicine did not find Hantavirus there, but in Hanta, Korea in the 1950s.  I won't really get into a discussion about cousin or sibling marriage, as it is clear that MANY organisms have an evolved lack of sexual attraction to those with whom they spent early life.  There are loads of taboos that result in avoidance of death and discord.  What literate cultures think of as history, is social apologia, and you really have to sift through all possible alternative viewpoints.  I think tangentially because EVERY situation has more parameters than we know. That's why I mentioned ecological thinking. Statistics are not valid unless all variables are taken into account.  Cells and genetics have become way more complicated as we gained more understanding in the last 18 years. Evolution is more complicated  and interwoven than anyone can think, but it is fun to add whatever new variables you learn, to confuse the simple-minded thinking all around you. Consider the Hebrew Job, and how \"Satan\" the Adversary, taunted Yahveh who was just one of the available powers (Elohim), who bragged about his follower, Job. Satan said, \"You're a fool to believe your own bragging. I doubt he is as loyal as you say. Test him.\" Right there is the difference between heuristics and reality. Job turned out to be pretty tightly bonded. I have NEVER observed such a human bond, but can tell you that once a wolf chooses to bond, that bond is of useflu and ultimate association.  I might have mentioned Robin Dunbar re: human social limits. Anthropologists who have failed to understand psychology, evolution and genetics, complexity of phenotypes, still reject evidence due to their narrow, biased approach . I was just reminded yesterday of my human physiology instructor who came down all over me for even bringing up telomeres back in the early 2000s.

We did go off on a tnagential look at thinking, and it's pretty clear that the effort to think ecologically is pretty difficult - just look at the content of most internet comment.  But most of the commentary here is by students trying to find their way through the concentrated lectures of Sapolsky. I came here because his work with baboons opened my mind to human social interactions.  Logical structures as proposed by philosophy is a whole 'nother way of conversation. Normal conversation is individual trains of thought, informed by what experiences and education any individual has.   Maybe autobiography can help understanding: \u00a0 I'm recently back (2 yrs) from near a decade living with a captive-born wolf. We lived life daily in the wild on terms natural to his kind; I did have to protect him from some consequences of his nature in a world \"owned\" by humans. Wolf communications are context-oriented, mostly nonsymbolic, and mostly nonverbal. Wolves, by the way, take in signals of all kinds, including inadvertent physical and chemical signals, that latter group less able to be picked up by us primates. Yet they associate and make sense of nonconscious signaling. So, my interpretation of what constitutes coherent language can differ from those who believe that a word has meaning without context. There's the logic!  VErbal language has been said to be only about 15% of communication content among humans - this by linguists.  We are sort of hijacking the comment column here, when we question one another. The subject is relevant, though to Sapolsky's work and his lecture, if we keep it all in mind.  Nah, I'm not at all on the autistic spectrum - more like extremely emotionally sensitive. (it's fun this spring to trace rhinencephalons and how humans think they're more different than they really are from other species!)  If you knew me, you might interpret some of my cynicism differently. I spent a couple years deeply involved in psych as a major, then as a minor; just about every term, including autism, is familiar. The public perception of individual variance is more diagnostic than it should be - there is a first tenet of psychology called the Fundamental Attribution Error; check that, to help understand that situation\u00a0 - context - is where we should give attention.  That way, all conversation makes more sense; we don't try to overevaluate. Reproductive-age females of our species do that for evolutionary reason, but casual conversation is casual.  \u00a0Although I'm not remotely autistic, I do like best when people look at things in depth. Sapolsky became involved in neurology, a discipline important to catch up on. Stanford is certainly the place to do that.  Just attended a lecture on molecular cell processes. It was so focused that I recognized how some biologists don't keep up on brain structural function - just like anthropologists fail when they fail to step into comparative ethology.  Just to repeat: life pursuing the wild has been the most interesting conversation I've known. I just visit human society to report and hopefully, correct when vitally necessary.
