I have read countless textbooks' sections on diagonalization and watched several other videos.

ALSO...nowhere else has anyone mentioned to ALWAYS choose x2=1.  That tiny detail helped make everything else click and I agree with you that the process of diagonalization is in fact easy, albeit time-consuming.  I cannot thank you enough for this!

The matrix A is a matrix that transforms space, everything gets shifted except for the eigenvectors, they just get longer. So what we can do is first map the eigenvectors to our unit vectors (X^-1), then scale those vectors (D), then map them back to the eigenvectors (X). Since these are all linear transformations, this is not only true for the eigenvectors, but also for all other vectors in the 2D plane.
