These lessons are definitely a huge help, but I'd like to gain an understanding of this that goes beyond just memorizing formulas.  For example, after watching this, I know how to multiply matrices; but I don't know what multiplying matrices achieves in practice or why I'd want to multiply matrices. I also don't know what makes us decide to represent a matrix as a column as opposed to a line (or vice versa). I often start asking myself these sorts of questions very early on during math lessons, and I have trouble paying attention as a result. It's hard to focus on the \"how\" when you'd really like to know the \"why\" first.

But it doesn't explain why matrix multiplication is what it is.   In my opinion, the way to motivate matrix multiplication is to start teaching linear algebra the exact opposite way from how this playlist does it. You start with vectors in space, then talk about linear transformations of space, then develop matrices as efficient ways of encoding the information of a linear transformation, and then define matrix multiplication as corresponding to the composition of linear transformations.

If I start with a matrix representing 3 linear equations with the variables x, y, and z, I have one column with all x\u2019s, another with all y\u2019s, and another with all z\u2019s. If I have another matrix with 3 linear equations that use the variables u and v, one column has all u\u2019s and the other has all v\u2019s. If I multiply the two systems of equations using matrix multiplication, the first entry has me adding an x*u to a y*u to a z*u, and I assume that I can just add the constant coefficients together.

Isn't it always the case since the condition for a matrix multiplication to be done is the same as for it being distributive? I mean if A and B wouldn't have n columns and C and D n rows you couldn't do the matrix multiplication anyway, right? Or was the point just to say that A and B and C and D must have the same dimensions? But that would be the same conditions as for matrix addition...
