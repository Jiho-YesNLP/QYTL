Just a remark on 3:00. The centripetal acceleration is not inversely correlated with the radius right? A=v^2/R , but v is also function of R. When we replace v by omega*R then we get a=omega sq*R\u2026The centripetal acceleration is proportional to the radius. Also, if we take for example a CD disk, the closer you get to the center the acceleration is going down since your tangential speeds is going down..and ultimately the centripetal acceleration is 0 in the center of the disk. If it would be inversely correlated the centripetal acceleration would go to infinite and the further you are from the center eventually the acceleration would go to zero which is not true. Omega is constant and your tangential speed goes up dramatically and also is your centrupetal acceleration.

Yes you understand how to manipulate the equations in a way that you have seen manipulated, but when a different perspective is given, you dont yet have the understanding needed to manipulate and solve. I can memorize. But the deeper understanding is where I struggle which is why memorizing type classes are easy, but deeper understanding classes like math, trig, physics, chem, so on, are always very difficult for me. But maybe im wrong about you, but with me, this is surely my problem.", "votes": "78", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB8f06awv0a-t", "comment": "Meat Missile g", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB90dTs3GApPS", "comment": "\u00a0@mollerbt\u00a0 ggs", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB90fU4lem463", "comment": "\u00a0@bigwinner9683\u00a0 ggs?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB90fnGMJjtf5", "comment": "\u00a0@mollerbt\u00a0 ggs!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB90gVgE75CvE", "comment": "\u00a0@celeryystick\u00a0 what's that mean?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB90gokuI38Jh", "comment": "\u00a0@mollerbt\u00a0 looks like you'll never know man", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZbLirQuT9uU", "cid": "UgyevnGEuKdPZj6PDeJ4AaABAg.8_d5GcDiNiB97C-Z_VJfU7", "comment": "Might be that you don\u2019t practice.

I tend to focus on the concepts in physics. Also making up scenarios for comparing problems help a bunch. Like if they ask you what would happed if x was increased or decreased. Set up a simulation. As long as you know the basics, you can apply them to anything. Also learn how to read physics problems. There\u2019s small nuances like instantaneous, constant, speeding up and slowing down.
