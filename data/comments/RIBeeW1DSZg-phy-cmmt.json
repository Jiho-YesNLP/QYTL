But in the example you solved you said for the box to slide  F= fs . Which i am a little bit confused about that because for the box to slide (move) the applied force must be greater than the static frictional force. So i suggest the minimum horizontal force needed to cause the box to slide is the applied force (Fa-fs) = net force .
