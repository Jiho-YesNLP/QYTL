It also demonstrates how to calculate average speed, average velocity, and instantaneous velocity.   Key moments: 00:02 Kinematics describes object motion without force references. Scalar quantities have magnitude only, while vector quantities have magnitude and direction.           -Difference between scalar and vector quantities. Scalar has magnitude only, vector has magnitude and direction.           -Displacement vs. distance. Displacement includes direction, distance is scalar and always positive.           -Temperature as a scalar quantity. It lacks direction and is described only by magnitude. 06:07 Understanding the concepts of distance, displacement, speed, and velocity is crucial in physics. Distance is scalar, always positive, while displacement is a vector with magnitude and direction.           -Difference between distance and displacement. Distance is scalar, while displacement is a vector with magnitude and direction.            -Differentiating speed and velocity. Speed is scalar, while velocity is a vector with magnitude and direction.  12:21 Average speed and average velocity may differ when there are changes in direction during motion. Instantaneous velocity represents the velocity at an instant, while average velocity indicates the average over an interval.           -Difference between average speed and average velocity. Average speed and velocity comparison with changes in direction.            -Understanding instantaneous velocity vs. average velocity. Calculation methods for instantaneous velocity and average velocity.            -Formulas for constant speed and acceleration. Relationship between displacement, velocity, and acceleration in motion calculations.  18:15 Understanding the equations for displacement, velocity, and acceleration is crucial for solving physics problems. Different equations can be derived and applied for motion along the x and y axes.           -Deriving and rearranging equations for displacement, velocity, and acceleration. It's important to have a list of equations for physics problems.            -Applying equations for motion along the x and y axes. Formulas can vary for different directions in physics problem-solving.            -Considerations when dealing with constant speed and acceleration. Use of symbols like v and v bar can vary based on the type of motion being analyzed in physics problems.  24:18 To convert meters per second to miles per hour, you need to convert meters to kilometers, then kilometers to miles, seconds to minutes, and minutes to hours. The final calculation results in 89.5 mph.           -Unit conversion steps involve converting meters to kilometers, kilometers to miles, seconds to minutes, and minutes to hours to calculate speed in mph.           -Detailed explanation on canceling units during conversions and the importance of ensuring units match in calculations.           -Solving for average velocity using the formula for displacement over time, with an example of a bus moving east and then west from a city.

Scalars are just the items themselves (magnitude) with no direction or anything (speed, distance) and Vectors are the items with the direction (velocity, displacement).  Velocity is the speed with the direction and is calculated with Displacement/Time while Speed is just the rate at which something moves (no attention to direction, hence why it is not a vector) and is calculated with Distance/Time. Scalars like speed and distance have no direction, so they are always positive, and vectors like velocity and displacement do have directions, so they can be positive and negative. You calculate distance by adding up the amounts traveled as their absolute value, regardless of direction. You calculate displacement by comparing the final position with the initial position (no attention to distance but instead to final distance from initial distance) (ex. Sal moves 10 in east, 11 west: The displacement would be -1 because the initial position is assumed to be 0 and after Sal went 10 places east, he returned 11 west, and so ended up 1 place more west than where he started, which was 0, hence since it was going to the left side, the displacement is -1. Instantaneous (speed) vs average (speed) is that instantaneous is calculated as an absolute value and tells you the speed at an instant in time, while the average speed tells the average over an interval. Avg. velocity is displacement (final position minus initial position)/time, while Inst. velocity is the change in displacement (final position minus initial position)/over the change in time. Displacement along the x-axis and y-axis are essentially the same, the only difference is that it is the final position minus initial position in the x and y axis accordingly. Average velocity is (displacement) change in position (X final- X initial; displacement;)/time, while average acceleration is the change in velocity (v final- v initial)/time.", "votes": "94", "replies": "4", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "UgwS0RvUBM_x1NbHjeB4AaABAg", "comment": "it's funny/ridiculous that you use metric system for the formulas but then you go on and use imperial system on your examples and exercises", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugyw7IiIdczKVohgF5N4AaABAg", "comment": "Why does the average velocity have two formulas first you added then divided, and then you subtracted final minus initial ??", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugz-qrKck9kJ9CCr0Ld4AaABAg", "comment": "Me cant understand acceleration and its types.

Let's say bob kicks a ball 10m/s on a 100m cliff 45 degrees. How far does it go?   So the velocity in the y would be sin(45)*10m/s and the velocity in the x would be cos(45)*10m/s  y = 8.509m/s x = 5.253m/s  Now that we have the velocity in the y (8.509m/s) We will make a height vs time function.  The double antiderivative of -9.8m/s is -4.9x^2 so  -4.9x^2 + 8.5x + 100 = 0 now we use the quadratic formula(-b\u00b1\u221a(b\u00b2-4ac))/(2a)  and get a result of: 5.4s  It will take 5.6 seconds to reach the bottom. Now we need to multiply this with the velocity in the x (5.253m/s) and we get our distance  D = 28.665M (5.6 * cos(45)*10m/s)", "votes": "2", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy58aGmL7dep_SDAGN4AaABAg", "comment": "this is literally right on time for my finals! literally 13 hours away omg you're a blessing <3", "votes": "55", "replies": "8", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "UgzshXITUbIaMQ3f-z14AaABAg", "comment": "Bro can u do the rain man and river crossing problems in vectors", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugwd_1e3-KoVPk75OCl4AaABAg", "comment": "So they say Julio doesnt reply to comments\ud83e\udd14lets see", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "UgzZALJJbPMZ4J3z3TF4AaABAg.9P61cGTMEEF9PI8WmyizB5", "comment": "Average velocity", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "UgzZALJJbPMZ4J3z3TF4AaABAg.9P61cGTMEEF9PIuhDAcuE0", "comment": "Ok thank you so much", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "UgxMFRVrqD8D3GkU8d94AaABAg.9OmwikznI2a9P60vhZPHgO", "comment": "I\u2019m pretty sure it is v=(Xf-xo)/time because velocity is displacement not distance", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "UgxMFRVrqD8D3GkU8d94AaABAg.9OmwikznI2a9e8UDmMAmys", "comment": "I guess the formulas under the \"constant acceleration\" are associated with that situation. so the average velocity under constant acceleration would be V=1/2(Vo+Vf) or V=Vo+Vf/2", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy5epPcNKO0ffSXnnN4AaABAg.9OYpsDNUmjV9QK_nSTG0ci", "comment": "mine 24 \rMinutes lmao", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy5epPcNKO0ffSXnnN4AaABAg.9OYpsDNUmjV9TieNQkSqsC", "comment": "I'm itching to know what you got but...no1 ever responds to that\ud83d\ude02", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy5epPcNKO0ffSXnnN4AaABAg.9OYpsDNUmjV9Tieaa7IPCa", "comment": "\u00a0@kingdribs9286\u00a0 aced it", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy5epPcNKO0ffSXnnN4AaABAg.9OYpsDNUmjV9TifUne_T0I", "comment": "\u00a0@jaafarmayyah1623\u00a0 Congrats\ud83d\ude42 can't believe you actually responded\ud83d\ude02pretty quickly too", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy5epPcNKO0ffSXnnN4AaABAg.9OYpsDNUmjV9Tiflg9TWDe", "comment": "\u00a0@kingdribs9286\u00a0 im studying rn too im just bored", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dHjWVlfNraM", "cid": "Ugy5epPcNKO0ffSXnnN4AaABAg.9OYpsDNUmjV9TigRQD10Mv", "comment": "\u00a0@jaafarmayyah1623\u00a0 I was watching this for revision purposes but it doesn't seem to be for A level.
