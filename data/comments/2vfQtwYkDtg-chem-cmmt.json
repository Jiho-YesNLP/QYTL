Assuming you mean why don't the lone pairs go axial 180 degrees apart? I know it 'looks' as if the axial positions are less crowded but it is acually the opposite if we look at bond angles - you can see this on the thumbnail actually. Lone pairs experience greater repulsion from bonding atoms as well as each other. Axial positions are 90 degrees apart from equatorial positions. So a lone pair in axial position will have 3x90 degree interactions with the equatorial bonding atoms. If we put the lone pair in equatorial position it has only 2x90 degree interactions and everything else is 120 degrees. As far as the electrons are concerned, they are less crowded in equatorial positions.
