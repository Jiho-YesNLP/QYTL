However, if you type the same code on an IDE, it will only return the calculation in the print function. One must use the print function to print something on an IDE, whereas there is no such necessity on a Shell. The code that is typed on a Shell is executed directly.

The correct term is a REPL.   When running the python command without any arguments or when using something like IDLE you get a REPL - it reads and executes a single line of input and it prints whatever the last statement in that line evaluates to. This is why it shows you that the type function return int.  When running a file with the python command, which is essentially what your IDE does, the only way to observe any output is by means of performing side effects. One such side effect is writing to the standard output. In a shell (like command prompt, or bash) you will see everything the program printed to it's standard output, IDEs also either use a shell internally or emulate one by reading the processes' standard output and displaying it to you.  Since you are most likely running your REPL in a shell (by starting up python in command prompt or bash) you will also see that print is outputting to the screen as well.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Y6J8I056Ffw", "cid": "UgwHx0UzA61h1otYv0x4AaABAg.8ycFLCoyQq-9AiCefcfvA3", "comment": "LOL HER FACE BEFORE SHE SAID PERFECT", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Y6J8I056Ffw", "cid": "UgwkC2ZQYr6QbxdZWIp4AaABAg.8pRoNakdxuQ8peYVq9XHFg", "comment": "Do you want people to wipe their hard disk drive?
