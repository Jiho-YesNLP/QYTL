Z as back to front, the arrow of time and perhaps the concept of consciousness. Each of the 3 planes or axis have 4 corners,  combining into 1 outward projected reality that forms the curvature of space. Higgs field gives consciousness most likely, not mass... That would make consciousness as the 4th dimension, perhaps the holographic reality a layer on that..Generally speaking, multiple dimensions exist within that framework. It gets very complicated very quickly, but you could see our physical reality as being the 5th dimension, I do for the most part and I do believe it to be utterly important that we view the Universe in the same way we view consciousness and dimentionality and maintain the same number of dimensions throughout.
