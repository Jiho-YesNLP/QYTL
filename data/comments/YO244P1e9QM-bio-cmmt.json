[{"vid": "YO244P1e9QM", "cid": "Ugz6fBvLBKf3d_iIjLN4AaABAg", "comment": "This video has been updated! See the 2023 UPDATED video here: https://youtu.be/1Dx7LDwINLU Expand to see important notes for this video. 1) This video, as stated in the description, focuses on general functions of biomolecules. The biomolecules: carbs, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, can all can have important functions in the body.  This is a video about the general function of biomolecules. For your dietary needs, consult with a dietitian or medical doctor.  2) We mention the popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules. As we mention, these are basics. There can be more elements (such as sulfur for example in proteins), but we wanted to identify common elements starting at the building block level.  At the building block level, some amino acids lack sulfur for example. It's not just sulfur. For example, there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen. The popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level. 3) Since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates, one character for lipids, and one character for proteins - unfortunately, when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type, it isn't designed to show a specific type. We received a great point in an email though that, since our little lipid character is a triglyceride, this can be confusing when naming lipid functions. For example, at 3:52 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane, it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there won't be any confusion as we do not want to imply that specific lipid type makes up the cell membrane. [Phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well]. We plan to explore creating individual, detailed videos on lipids, carbs, and proteins where we can show different types.

It needs all the other kinds of molecules to do the work.   Imagine ordering an Ikea desk and receiving only the instructions. How would you build a desk? You need parts and hardware. Imagine ordering an Ikea desk and receiving only parts and no instructions. How would you build a desk? How about if you received the parts and instructions but no hardware? I think you get the point. ---------------------------------------  btw - this is why life, a first cell, cannot emerge from lifeless molecules on an ancient Earth. There are too many kinds of very sophisticated molecules and they must be arranged very precisely and they must contain the instructions to operate.
