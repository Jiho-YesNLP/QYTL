Suppose you wanted to know cosine's derivative.    You start by sketching cosine's graph at each quarter turn position within the cycle.  You know it starts at 1, and proceeds to equal zero at a quarter turn, equals -1 after a half turn, then zero at the 3rd quarter, then it returns to 1 after a full cycle.  You then look at the zero crossings at each quarter turn.  It is falling at the first quarter, and rising at the third quarter.

He also compounded this oversimplification by claiming it is \"learning how to take the derivative of\", and I'll expound on that later.
