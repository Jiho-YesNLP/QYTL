Actually as a physics student I find this series very useful , quick way to get an overview of the subject with relevant visualizations and without too much algebra . Nobody said that the course provides a PhD , this is a great way for somebody who already knows the subject to rehearse and see the physics a little bit clearer , without the algebraic fog . For someone who hasn't studied physics at academic level , this would be a great way to understand the idea of physics behind everyday phenomenons .", "votes": "8", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fmXFWi-WfyU", "cid": "Ugxb2arBM-cMy1saX_N4AaABAg", "comment": "I think I'm in love with this woman", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fmXFWi-WfyU", "cid": "UgzUA5QS1jwFf98ke3N4AaABAg", "comment": "Still can't understand rolling without slipping", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fmXFWi-WfyU", "cid": "Ugz8-XuFh9A_zjF6lrZ4AaABAg.8qnKFY4e6Fd8vrukcG_0Ik", "comment": "speed: x2", "votes": "12", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "fmXFWi-WfyU", "cid": "Ugz8-XuFh9A_zjF6lrZ4AaABAg.8qnKFY4e6Fd92_g3NPwQSK", "comment": "Mc^2", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "fmXFWi-WfyU", "cid": "Ugz8-XuFh9A_zjF6lrZ4AaABAg.8qnKFY4e6Fd93h4qQN-2UU", "comment": "oh really!\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "fmXFWi-WfyU", "cid": "UgwVKf1jQ2mAclfHAbJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Mam , you are like my mother ....great answer.....

So how long does it take for the minute hand to move from 12 to 1?

There are some positive comments from students.  * They can have been designed for a specific use, for example that people should start from \"Course #1\" and watch every course in the correct order.  * But it can also be about people trying to follow a \"success formula\" ... that it has worked well for other crash courses and that they now have got 4.5 million subscribers (to 572 videos).  The first two explanations are relatively rational. They have simply forgot to include information about intended audience and intended use. They focused on the \"mind blowing\". :-)  (from the description) Did you know that, at a certain point on a moving wheel... there's no motion? I mean, kinda... it's all relative, right? Prepare to have your mind blown in this episode of Crash Course Physics where Shini delves into the world of Rotational Motion!  The third explanation may feel rational to some people.

So instead of thinking about spinny-things, I'm going to take the much simpler case that is more feasible, but which looks at the same  question.  Imagine you have somehow constructed a hugely powerful spaceship that can travel at half the speed of light.  If this spaceship were to then fire a photon beam, would this beam of light be travelling at 1.5 times the speed of light relative to an observer away from the spaceship? It turns out no!  In fact, it is one of the Fundamental Laws of Physics that light always travels at the speed of light.  Always.  If you were to fire a beam of light and then were to travel beside it very close to the speed of light, it would still travel away from you at the speed of light!  This is such a remarkable fact that an entire new subject of Physics had to be invented to deal with it:  Special Relativity.  If you aren't aware of this bit of Physics I highly recommend looking into it, because it fundamentally changed the way we understood how the Universe works.  It has some pretty far-reaching effects, not least of which is that all of the Crash Course episodes so far aren't actually true!  (Well, they're actually very good approximations to reality for slow things.  As soon as you start travelling close to the speed of light, weird things happen to ensure that you don't go faster than the Cosmic Speed Limit.)  Such curious things include:  moving clocks slow down, moving rulers shrink, space and time aren't separate things but connected together into 'spacetime', and even the famous equation E=mc^2, saying that mass and energy are very much interlinked.  There's no way I can fully explain the ins and outs of Relativity in one comment (it normally takes a full College/University semester course on the subject to get a complete grip, and I've also missed some pretty major points).  If you're interested in all of this, then there a whole bunch of YouTube videos that can do a better job of explaining than I have.  I'm happy to recommend some videos etc. if you're interested.

In terms of derivation this is something that you will have to just accept not knowing much about to start off with, just as people accept that the corner shaped pieces of a puzzle must be placed in the corners. However, as you learn more and more about the subject you will be able to make connections, and slot in the rest of the pieces of the puzzle.   Physics is daunting above all else, and that's why a good teacher who will answer your questions is invaluable. If you don't know or are unsure you must be willing to ask for help. You must also be willing to give it a go, and learn from your mistakes (where you made them).     In answer to your question, no, a vacuum will have no effect. If you were trying to work out deceleration due to air resistance then it would, but for the maths behind rotation, no.   As a rule of thumb though don't try to over complicate things.

Centrifugal force gets bigger when you go faster, true, but it gets smaller if you're going in a bigger circle. You can try this yourself in a child's playground. Choose the same tangential speed and you'll see that the centrifugal force weakens at larger radii.   1000 mph seems big, but remember that no demonstration you have ever or could ever see uses a ball as big as the Earth - a radius of 4 million miles. You bring up a good point with the Earth's orbital speed, which is 67,000 mph, but Earth's orbital radius is 92 million miles - an unimaginable distance.  Water will stick to a ball happily, if there is a force to hold it there. The problem with your example is that, if you performed the experiment on Earth, the gravity from the Earth is much stronger than the gravity from the ball, so the water would fall off the ball, being attracted towards the Earth. If you got far enough away from the Earth to do this experiment fairly, you would indeed see the water stick to the ball.  Your proposed explanation for the affects attributed to gravity is what exactly? Density, buoyancy and weight? Could you please define exactly what you mean by these terms and what they explain? I only ask because we clearly disagree so harshly and I want nothing less than to disrupt communication. For example, here are the definitions I am familiar with:   Density: Mass per unit volume Buoyancy: The upward force on a body from a fluid, due to the displaced fluid's weight Weight: A force whose cause is gravity (This is were I think we really have trouble understanding each other!)  As to your quote, I am quite happy to try to explain things without maths, but if you are asking specific questions about the sizes of forces or the relative importance of variables, then maths really is the ideal language for the discussion.

The wheel turns clockwise, from our perspective. As a point on the wheel closes in on the bottom of the wheel, its velocity vector that says it is moving around the center of the wheel points to the left. But the whole wheel (that point included) should also have a velocity vector directed to the right.  As a result of this, points that are in contact with the surface have a net velocity of the sum of -v_tangential and +v_translational. If the wheel is rolling \"without slipping,\" those speeds should equal one another in magnitude, and cancel out when adding them.  This also means that points at the top of the wheel are moving with speed 2v, and the points on the far left and right of the wheel are moving along the horizontal axis with just speed v.
