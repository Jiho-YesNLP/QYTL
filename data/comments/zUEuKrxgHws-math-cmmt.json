I made two intuitive explanations.  Imagine the volume of revolution.its just the bump on the flat surface with Max value at the origin and  decreasing strictly to infinity.(but it never touches the surface). pick a point on the 3d diagram and make a 2 slices  vertically and side wards perpendicular to the flat surface.these slices are perpendicular and having equal area .becoz the volume is symmetrical about vertical and sideward axis(((V=Q^2)).this is becoz the 2d curve we used for revolution is symmetric about vertical axis.  2...Imagine the following.take the volume of revolution and cut vertically into n slices..these slices are 2D as n tends to infinity.  The slice which passes through the origin is of same size as that of the one we used for revolution but they are in 2 perpendicular plane.  As we move away from the origin((side wards))the size of the slices got reduced by the factorC.  Then What is the factor?.the factor is the curve in the vertical plane..  (Go back to the diagram in the lecture) The slice at the distance y=b is diminished by the factor C=(e^-b)^2.....  And for any slice C =C=(e^-y)^2..here c is a variable constant.  Finally ,r gives us the information about the diminishing factor..++++.I am a student and interested in learning..I interested in learning with other people and I believe in team work..contact  me if u r interested  Gmail: karthi211421@gmail.com", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zUEuKrxgHws", "cid": "UgwyN_HxydIh4Q70zix4AaABAg.983yi1gKK9O98bKOU_YZN7", "comment": "\u00a0@karthikKarthik-by6ws\u00a0 Wow.
