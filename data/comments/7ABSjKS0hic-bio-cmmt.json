If everything evolved from a single cell then it means that the genetic information of any organism is 100 percent variabled via mutation, albeit generally static after birth. Everything, from the length of your bones, their thickness, etc, all of the specifications of your body plan is contained in your DNA, correct? And mutations may act on any part of that specification \"information\", hence every trait of an organism is 100 percent variabled via mutation if a mutation happens. Okay, so what am I getting at? Essentially, why are there no failed nodes in bone structure? I say bone structure specifically, because having a bone anomaly is not necessarily a life ender, but all bone structures are basically smooth and perfect to do what they do, and are not bumpy. Life in general is very not ugly, which it seems it should be according to this line of thinking.  The only explanation for this is also problematic. That is, only traits (which are built on mutations) that cause an organism to be more fit to survive in its current environment are retained, and develop into traits. This is problematic, because then there should be a very visible, non-gapped, progression through all living things. Talk of supposed missing links is missing the real point. Where are all the missing intermediary intermediary forms? The intermediary intermediary intermediary forms, etc? It should be entirely smooth, in the fossil record and in living things, and when I say entirely I mean \"very very\".   Also, problematic with this apparently harmonious view (which is essentially what all evolution-accepting people believe) is how can a mutation be retained if its contribution to the survivability of an organism cannot be felt, or if it is just barely apparent? For example, it is said that a wing developed from bird-like tree dwelling animals gliding to the ground via burgeoning wing appendages, but what about the form before it was even able to be used to glide? I've seen one explanation for the bat wing, saying that it could have been used to hold water, previous to being used for gliding. That's fine, but what about before that, and before that? What I mean is, we know now that our cells correct for changes in our DNA (this is not to intone that mutations cannot cause change, but that there is definite impediment to \"natural\" change), so if you were to take a form to its very origination, when it juuuust started, why would it be retained? We, also, know that changes in features are very small and compiled over time. Often, Darwin's finches are used as an example of such a change happening, and over a relatively short period, but this still misses the point. A beak has a function, (and arguably potential function), but small fluctuations leading to change on an already functioning trait do not explain how the trait originated, or how it was retained. So, what about the very beginning of the formation of the beak? Day one of the beak, if you will. There has to be an apparent advantage on Day One. To say that every burgeoning trait simply did increase fitness from day one seems implausible.  I've also heard that mutations may be stored sometimes, and appear later on, but my research here is very lacking.

While sponges are quite different then us, or dogs, or crabs, or whatever else you can imagine as a different animal, sponges and us are considered animals (kingdom Animalia).  Your question about \"why are sponges even an animals\" is because taxonomy & systematics (giving names to entire evolutionarily related groups species) are based on shared derived characteristics called synapomorphies. Synapomorphies define groups such as Animalia to to be composed of species that all share characteristics in common (because they inherited them from a common ansestor) AND that those characteristics are also derived/unique from just the characteristic it self (not just a common ansestor, but an exclusive common ansestor that all and only those species in the group share).  So for animals, sponges and us we share features that had evolved in the ansestor of all animals (e.g. multicellularity, and heterotrophic). Since then the ansestor that eventually give rise to both us and sponges had many more evolutionary changes, each of those make up other synapomorphies, which define other groups to which sponges are unique and we are not a part of (like the Phylum Porifora) while the same goes for us (like the Phylum Chordata) that sponges are not a part of.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7ABSjKS0hic", "cid": "UgiHm3WwuIo6S3gCoAEC.8UCOdYnUfHW8rQL5qGow40", "comment": "They're considered animals because they do have certain things that make them animals.

But the idea of universal common decent, the idea that lions and oak trees share a common ancestor is a hypothesis based on the evidence. Biological evolution is a factual natural process, while universal common descent is a conclusion.  You aren't required to accept universal common descent to accept the theory of evolution in it's entirety. In science, it doesn't matter if you believe there is a supernatural being within every natural process in the cosmos. The science works the same whether you are a Christian, a Hindu or an atheist. It's simply a method of investigating reality and objectively explaining it's processes.  It sounds like you hold the position of most education Christians world-wide, that evolution is true but that god is ultimately responsible.
