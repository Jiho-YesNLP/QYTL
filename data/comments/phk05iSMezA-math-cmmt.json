We know that the gradient of a scalar function is normal to its level curves, so the gradient of F(x, y, z),  Grad(F) = [f_1(x, y), f_2(x, y), -1] will be normal to the surface defined by the function z = f(x, y).  The function F(x, y, z) will be a scalar valued function of three variables, so it will be a 4D surface, which is very hard to visualize. You can however compare it to, say, the half sphere z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), and how it relates to its level curves x^2 + y^2 = C^2. The gradient of z will be normal/perpendicular to the level curves for appropriate x and y.  One, possbily easier, way to looks at it is to look at the vectors [1, 0, f_1(x, y)], which when projected onto the xy-plane, is parallel to the x-axis with slope f_1(x, y) and [0, 1, f_2(x,y)], a line parallel to the y-axis with slope f_2(x, y). If you take the cross product, you'll end up with a new vector that's perpendicular to both of the aforementioned vectors, normal to the surface z = f(x, y).", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "phk05iSMezA", "cid": "UgyN45-g-_w-ez54Uip4AaABAg.8_lE0y4uv8-8_nhQZx06Fx", "comment": "kjQtte thanks .
