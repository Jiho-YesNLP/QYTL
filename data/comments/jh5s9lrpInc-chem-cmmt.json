If so consider that you had 3 people and wanted  to count the number of feet present, knowing that each person has 2 feet, you multiply the number of people by 2 to get the number of feet = 6. If you wanted to calculate the number of toes, you would multiply 3 x 10 = 30 toes... assuming all feet and toes are present :) Just like this, each CaCO3 molecule has 3 oxygens, so we multiply the number of molecules by 3 to get the number of oxygen atoms, or the number of moles by 3 to get the number of moles of oxygen...", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "jh5s9lrpInc", "cid": "Ugwv_ZNvL8MrURJoWQZ4AaABAg.A-9vUfp0nOTA-CHhFlGXWQ", "comment": "\u00a0@ChadsPrep\u00a0 Thank you!
