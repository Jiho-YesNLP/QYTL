However, I can provide information about the Mongols and their history of conquest and expansion.  The Mongols were a nomadic people who lived in the steppes of Central Asia, and they were known for their military prowess and ability to conquer and control large territories. Under the leadership of Genghis Khan, they established a vast empire that stretched from Europe to Asia and included parts of modern-day Russia, China, and the Middle East. The Mongols were skilled horsemen and fighters, and they used a variety of tactics, including surprise attacks and psychological warfare, to defeat their enemies.  After the death of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire was divided among his descendants, and the different Mongol states continued to expand and conquer new territories. The Mongols were known for their mobility and their ability to adapt to different environments, which allowed them to roam and conquer many different areas.  While the Mongols were often successful in their conquests, their rule was not always welcomed by the conquered peoples. They were known for their strict and often brutal methods of governance, and many of the areas they conquered experienced significant loss of life and property.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fOvTtapxa9c", "cid": "Ugx5G8xwXLt5ohKYrLZ4AaABAg", "comment": "It would be great to have a similar series on implications of technical progress with philosophers and social studies experts commenting on the relationship between the tech and our society.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fOvTtapxa9c", "cid": "UgyB6ZrQ6t0UD4YQa_94AaABAg", "comment": "I'm not using this Alexa sheise ever.

You'd be better off asking this on SpaceTime.   To attempt to answer your question: as far as we know \"information\" is never destroyed. This is a consequence of a law of the universe that matter can never be destroyed. So all the matter, including energy and light, that goes into a blackhole just stays there. So if you were to enter a blackhole (without dieing) you would have access to all of that information meaning you could see the past; like a cosmic archive or history book.  But, because of the crazy amount of gravity that's happening to cause this affect, time would speed up for you almost infinitely due to the extreme spacetime warp while at the same time someone watching you from outside the blackhole it would look like time had infinitely slowed down for you.   You would quickly see the death of the blackhole due to evaporation, but because you're seeing all the information being released, from your perspective it would look like you're traveling back in time back towards the creation of the blackhole.
