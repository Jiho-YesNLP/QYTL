Origin of life millions/billions of years ago -Introduction of Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes.   2. Multicellular organisms and their genetic material.  - Length of their genome  - Evolutionary study of their genome  3. How we understood the basis of genetics.  - Structure of DNA  - How we all have 99.9% same genome   4. Use of Fluorescence to sequence genome (Visualisation) - Comparison of genome of trillions of our own cells - treatment of diseases (genetically)  5. Ethics in Biology   6. Inheritance  7. Application of everything we are going to learn (in real world: Crimes and medicine)  8. Know about your ancestry/Lineage - for catching criminals  9. Cell signalling and how molecules/cells interact within our body   10. How our body takes it's shape?  - Learn about our body with the help of some models of Fly's embryo (I guess can't study with human embryo because of those ethical stuff explained before\ud83d\udc40)  Thank you!

And, since all humanity has common ancestry you can take any random haplogroup, let's say...R1B Ydna haplogroup, which is the main Ydna haplogroup in continental Europe (except the mediterranean), all R1B is the same DNA to that haplogroup level, so everyone has the same earlier groups from L1084 in Africa long long ago, and it starts to split off more and more.   Then let's extend it to L21 haplogroup , which is a subset of R1B, so all the people at L21 have the same genetic haplogroup code from that group back to the common haplogroup L1085. L21 is one of the more common haplogroups in the UK, Ireland and Brittany France (used to be called \"Atlantic celtic\" because it was \"highly correlative with the geography with the atlantic Celts\").   Than you can go to a subset of that like DFxx. And so on and just add random haplotypes which could correlate to a living being in the UK, Ireland or the US.   Because we all have shared human ancestry (and genetics is one not the many reasons why we KNOW this), the majority of everyones genetic code is already known because various ancestral places of origins have only a certain number of haplogroups (other than small groups moving in)  But, each more specific haploGROUP has haploTYPES which become more and more specific to relations and then families and then individuals. If you have someones fourth or third cousins (relation by paternal xgreat grandfather, this example is Ydna not MtDna) specific Ydna haplotype you can narrow down their more. I use family tree dna and so does my mom and in their \"family\" search right away it basically said 'this is your mother', I can't remember it was something like '1 branch off, mother, sibling or child'. Same way they do paternity tests (and and extrapolation of that is essentially the same way we know how were are related to all life on earth and how)  Search \"Ydna family tree dna map\" and look at images. Pick one of the broader haplogroups on the migration map...then search for that with the words \"genetic homeland\" so (\"R1B genetic homeland\" and the site should be on the search, go the the site and click \"pedigree\" and it will show you every single haplogroup of that haplogroup back to ancient African origins. R1B M343) to the first one is 23 of them (well, the first two Paleoanthropologists). Do it to another haplogroup and you'll see some of the earlier ones match but that line split off somewhere.
