My name is Natalie Gilbert, and I am mature student studying access to higher education in land based studies, at Hadlow college in Kent. As a part of my course, I am to design a scientific project which has given me the opportunity to gather data through this questionnaire on to how domestic cats (Felis Catus) affect the local wildlife population within the UK. From this, I am hoping to achieve a better understanding as to what factors may influence the hunting behaviour of different domestic cats. For precise data, I have opted to ask you to complete this questionnaire for each cat you own. This questionnaire should take a total of 5-10 minutes to complete, and the data will be gathered on an anonymous and confidential basis.

You make the same mistake as many of my students: mixing up Tinbergens question 3 ( adaptive value) and 4 \u00a0(evolutionary history). Your explanation for question 4 is actually an answer to question 3. An answer to question 4 could be something \u00a0like: \"Pheromones are used by many types of mammals and is likely to have evolved long ago... however, the specific sex pheromone used by this hamster is unique for this species, thus it is a fairly recent modification to the smell, possibly as a means to avoid interbreeding with other hamster species\". In other words: question 4 asks to what extent the behavior could be explained as a \u00a0a phylogenetic \"leftover\" from evolution acting on ancestors. /Andreas (Lecturer in Ethology and Behavioral Ecology)", "votes": "11", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "EyyDq19Mi3A", "cid": "UghVrbPADa4fL3gCoAEC", "comment": "Hank you are awesome. \u00a0Great job with your Team on these videos. \u00a0I appreciate your hard work in this crash course. \u00a0Keep up the great work. \u00a0", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "EyyDq19Mi3A", "cid": "Ugji9nYEb8Y_xngCoAEC", "comment": "http://www.journals.elsevier.com/animal-behaviour/\u00a0https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/animal-behaviour", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "EyyDq19Mi3A", "cid": "UgjaTxXEDZncG3gCoAEC", "comment": "2nd year of my degree again.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "EyyDq19Mi3A", "cid": "Ugi24hiUbJ0qcXgCoAEC", "comment": "This is the sexiest I've ever seen you, Hank. & I've never looked at you in that light lol. facepalm You're like a teacher to me; should be completely looked at as non-sexy.
