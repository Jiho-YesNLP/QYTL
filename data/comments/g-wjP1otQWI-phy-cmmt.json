A weak, but not entirely invalid argument.)  I would like to point out that \"resistance\" never changes because it is a scalar, real number that does not depend on any other factor. You probably meant to say \"impedance\" which is a complex variable that depends on some integral of t (transient analysis), s (Laplace transform), or j-omega (Fourier transform).  Most standalone batteries are DC batteries. However, there at least definitely exist alternator circuits that can turn this DC power source into an AC signal using metastable circuits. Depending on your definition of \"battery\", they can potentially be considered \"AC batteries.\"  Wall outlets are not the only source of AC current. In fact, if you want to say that, then we would not only have to include power lines, but any arbitrary system connected to a step-down transformer. There are also some circuits that have the power to \"pull\" current and can alternate between these \"push\" and \"pull\" systems.

Specifically, your point about DC characteristics of capacitors. The main argument that I would like to present is that it is a little more complicated than \"DC cannot pass through a capacitor.\"  To begin my nitpick, I would like to point out that the general behavior of a capacitor is to store charge. The capacitor stores potential electric energy, the EMF, or voltage (depending on how you want to look at it).  At this point, I would like to admit that, yes, the steady-state DC characteristics of a capacitor is a break in the circuit, but to understand why, we need insight gained from looking at the transitive DC characteristics of a capacitor.  If we assume a zero state on all components, at the beginning of the system's life (or as lim(t)->0), the voltage stored in a capacitor is 0V. As current flows through the circuit, this capacitor voltage will eventually settle on the voltage of the battery (assuming that the capacitor's design and material allows for the storing of the battery's voltage, when/if doing this experiment, please note the ratings on the capacitor, the capacitor's material design, and the way you're handling the capacitor).  So what is the significance of this? Well,  we can actually calculate the current moving through the resistor using a combination of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's Voltage law. (This combination technique may also be called Mesh Analysis.)  So at lim(t)->0, using Mesh Analysis, we can see that: V_total = 0 V_total = V_battery + V_resistor + V_capacitor -V_battery = V_resistor (Note that V_battery will be negative because it \"supplies\" power and rather than \"expend\" power.) I_resistor = V_resistor / R or I_resistor = -V_battery / R And this is a non-trivial, non-zero number.  Your point is probably describing this: Let's say that the circuit reaches steady-state when 0<t<5s (not an unreasonable assumption as 5 seconds is a long donkey's worth of time...), our mesh analysis looks like this: V_total = 0 V_total = V_battery + V_resistor - V_battery (since electrons cannot jump from one pole of a capacitor to the other, the voltage must return from the direction it came from, unless we somehow factor in quantum tunneling.) 0 = V_resistor And since Ohm's law states: V = I/R Then, I = 0/R = 0  In between these two states, the capacitor will charge logistically up to V_battery (because the current going into the capacitor decreases as the capacitor charges, leading to a decrease in the rate at which the capacitor charges.)  So, yes, you can use a capacitor to block current in a DC circuit. However, I would definitely not recommend doing so, especially if you have a low-power, low-resistance resistor (burnt out resistors can become very smelly :P). I would finally like to conclude that, although capacitors act in this way in DC circuits, there are still other, legitimately good reasons to use capacitors in DC circuits. Also, this behavior will also be handy when we look at AC circuits and electronic signals (such as arbitrary waveforms and analog sensor signals).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "g-wjP1otQWI", "cid": "UggpFjNhCSgzFngCoAEC.8KZEnW4Xa6j8KZesH_Ohoc", "comment": "Wow guys I do know electricity ;'D  I did think that someone will say that its still charging and may be a super cap which would take up all the charge and demand more :P  About using caps in circuits...

I'm not very good at communicating my thoughts very well. However, just as +Anas Malas said, my intention was to make clear that the diagram, like most things in life, can be interpreted as correct or incorrect depending on how you look at the problem associated with the diagram.  I guess, crudely speaking, I was \"nitpicking\" on the \"nitpick\". Sorry about that... -_-  Also, I should also correct myself because I realized that I had made a mistake. The reason that voltage in a capacitor faces the direction the current was coming from is that, as current decreases, the number of electrons that pass through the inner material of the capacitor stop passing through, as they cannot move (because current implies a movement of electrons; which can also be interpreted\u00a0using the\u00a0opposite\u00a0direction using electron \"holes\", which goes on to the topic of polarity... annnd I think I'll stop there... we might be getting in too deep.) -_-  Oh. And one more thing +Anas Malas. Yes, AC can pass through capacitors. But DC can also pass through capacitors too! Simply speaking, AC describes an electrical system with a \"push\" or \"pull\" while DC can only push. But let's say that I add a DC offset to an AC system and, therefore, have an electrical system that can only \"push\", a \"DC\" system, capacitors will still let this \"DC\" current to pass through. It's a little nitpicky but this is a pretty awesome property. It allows us to add some cool features such as hardware debouncing for noisy buttons and switches for small systems without negative\u00a0supplies\u00a0and even makes computer/digital music possible with sound cards being able to use digital data through DACs and filters! :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "g-wjP1otQWI", "cid": "UggpFjNhCSgzFngCoAEC.8KZEnW4Xa6j8KocIr_y1kL", "comment": "hg202 dude...
