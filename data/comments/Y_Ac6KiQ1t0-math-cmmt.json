Now, in this example, x is a two dimensional vector. Let us write x explicitly,  [x1, x2]. This is the function's input. The output is P*x. Let us write the projection matrix P explicitly, P = [p1, p2], where p1 & p2 are column vectors. Carrying out the multiplication P*x results in x1*p1+x2*p2(this time the asterisk indicates a vector by scalar multiplication), namely, P*x is the combination/sum of the first column of P, p1, and the 2nd column of P, p2, weighted by the appropriate components of x. So, x1*p1+x2*p2 is in the column space of P.  Additionally, we know, from the geometry of the problem,  that the projection matrix, P, takes a two dimensional vector, x, and projects it onto the prescribed line vector. (*) Namely, for any vector x, x1*p1+x2*p2, the linear combination of the columns of P, lie on the chosen projection line vector. Try x=[1, 0] to get 1*p1+0*p2=p1, to show that p1 is on the line vector. Do the same for x=[0,1]. This means that both p1 and p2, lie on the line vector.  Since both p1 and p2 are vectors that point in the same direction (or lie  on the same line vector), they are dependent vectors. The dimension of a space spanned by two dependent vectors is 1.  Since these vectors are the columns of P, the rank of P , which is the dimension of its column space,  is 1.
