Now, what happens when your reaction reactions equilibrium. According to our equation \u2206G\u02da = - nFE\u02da = - RTln(K), you are absolutely correct. Once the reaction has reaction equilibrium, the only way that the reaction will have a K > 1 is if our cell voltage at standard state conditions (1M concentration) is positive.
