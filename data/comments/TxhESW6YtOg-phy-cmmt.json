I really admire your passion in teaching and somewhat envy you :(. I don't know your age or if you're already in college or what, but you sound just like an average senior high school student. So the fact that you've already nearly-mastered all branch of sciences and also math is truly mesmerizing. Not to mention you now teach what you already have known, or you're just really a fast learner who read, study, and teach what you learned. Nonetheless I hope you the best! Keep doing what you're doing 'cause it fuels me to learn more about science (especially Chem). Last 4 years, I have been trying to master every branch of Math up to Calculus now that I'm in the 12th grade. But then I realize that I need to be a jack of all subjects to be the top student in my class.

Acceleration is greater or less depending on total mass of objects.   Although.. I'm now thinking about one of those desk gadgets with swinging steel balls..idk what they are called..   It gets a bit confusing because one ball stops, and one flies away fast after a hit.  But I think it still has to do with acceleration.  If you dropped both balls from equal height and hit them together,  then they would act equal on each other(if the balls are identical mass).     The real question is:  Why is the universe's expansion accelerating?
