It must have been a typo in the slides or maybe I accidentally said the wrong thing incorrectly (I didn't get a chance to check the recording yet). Oxygen-evolving complex called Z-enzyme is attached to the inner surface of the thylakoid membrane. The enzyme has four Mn ions that are light energized and remove electrons from OH component of water forming oxygen. So, the essential element required for water splitting in photosynthesis leading to release of oxygen is Mn.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
