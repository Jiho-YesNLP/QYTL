If you plan to work in research in a field that involves some theoretical work, then it is very important. If you plan to work in industry, then on average I would say it is not so important, but it will develop your problem-solving and logical thinking skills, which can be useful in any type of programming task.

I am just about to begin my Computer Science degree and I have some doubts that you have gone through 6 years ago. I know nothing about computer science and programming in general.

I wanted to see how many people came this far in the course and saw your comment.

Programming is a bit different than studying Math or any other class. Its not just theoretical and calculations, you have to practice like its a physical thing. And definitely studying last week doesnt cut it. You can study less than other classes in a day but it has to be regularly. Consistency is the key. I suggest checking few udemy courses if you plan to start. The things you cover ends in just few weeks but you get more mileage which will give you an advantage over people.
