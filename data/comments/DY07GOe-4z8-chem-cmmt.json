At least to me , it makes clear how the Gibbs Free Energy relation is \"derived\" from a consideration of the second law in the form -- change in entropy of the universe is always non-negative.

You said the number of moles are constant.But in a reaction like A+B=C won't the number of moles change. And if that were the case, now that P and T is constant, and n can change as shown the the equation, won't V also be able to change?   But even if that were the case,delta H would still be equal to the heat exchanged Q since the pressure of the system is held constant?But im not sure about why n is constant.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "DY07GOe-4z8", "cid": "UgwN--6_UIge8C79QzB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks for this video, very helpful! Still, something remains unclear to me, maybe you would be so kind to answer it?  The thermodynamic potential for G = U - TS + PV, with U the inner energy. With dU = T dS - PdV (no particle exchange assumed), this leads to dG = -SdT + VdP.  You said that the derived equation, dG = dH - TdS, only holds for constant pressure and constant temperature (dP=dT=0). But then for the above eq. we have: dG = -SdT + VdP = 0 = dS_universe  What is going on here?
