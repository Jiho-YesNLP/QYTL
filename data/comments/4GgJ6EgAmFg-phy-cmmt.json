Here are a few reasons why L is commonly used to represent angular momentum: Consistency with Linear Momentum: In many physics textbooks and courses, linear momentum is denoted by  p. Using a different letter for angular momentum helps to distinguish it from linear momentum. The letter  L was likely chosen to maintain consistency with the letter  p, as it is a prominent letter in the Latin alphabet. Connection to the Term \"Angular\": The letter L may be chosen to represent angular momentum because it resembles the shape of a spinning object. When you think of an object rotating or spinning, it often forms a circular or angular shape, which aligns with the use of the letter  L to represent angular momentum. Mathematical Convenience: In mathematical equations and formulas,  L is a convenient letter to use because it is clear and easy to distinguish from other symbols. It also doesn't have any specific meaning attached to it, allowing it to be used in various contexts related to angular momentum without confusion.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "4GgJ6EgAmFg", "cid": "UgyeWIhluJFYhi7l1id4AaABAg", "comment": "it took me so much time to find a video/ explaination in such a easy language.

The reason is friction and drag apply external torques to the system, along with unintentional torques that his other hand applied to the system, which is why it didn't get to the speed that conservation of angular momentum would predict.   He thinks it is kinetic energy that is conserved instead of angular momentum, but refuses to accept that there is work done on a rotating system to redistribute its mass closer to the center, which would explain why kinetic energy can increase.
