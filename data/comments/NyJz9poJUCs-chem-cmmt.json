In your example the 1st step is both of these, but if the 2nd step had a slightly higher TS energy than the 1st step, would the 2nd step now become the RDS, even though the 1st step still has a larger gap from reactant energy to TS energy for that step?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "NyJz9poJUCs", "cid": "UgwvYUdTH5tbN5xvAXh4AaABAg", "comment": "Powerful \ud83d\udcaa", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "NyJz9poJUCs", "cid": "Ugx6SdHCSbvS53ISAyR4AaABAg", "comment": "I was stuck on reaction coordinate diagrams, but you made them very clear.
