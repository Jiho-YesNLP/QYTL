The first half of the course up through Lecture 9 focuses on molecular biology and then the second half is devoted to cell biology. Lecture 9 is on analyzing genes and genomes (experimental techniques for molecular biology research) and Lecture 10 marks the pivot to cell biology as an overview lecture: Introduction to Cell Biology.

And, indeed, finding a conclusive answer has been frustrating. You\u2019re correct that some lipid anchored proteins are classified as integral. Also, though, other GPI-anchored membrane proteins are classified as peripheral. And, a wonderful paper by Guo, et al from 2018 argues that we, in fact, need three classifications of membrane proteins: integral, peripheral and lipid-anchored.  This is partly due to the ambiguity around this issue. Again, great question!  So, it seems the only answer I can provide is an unsatisfactory one: there is no blatant error in this lecture video because some lipid linked proteins are peripheral, but some are integral as well. To me, this is another example of the nuanced complexity of biology and our incompatible desire to classify all of life into neat bins and boxes.  Just as a cell could never answer if it is in very late metaphase or very early anaphase (due to the boundaries between the phases of mitosis being quite blurry), it also appears that some membrane proteins cannot be clearly classified as peripheral vs integral. I learned something new here investigating this answer. Thanks so much for that and for your interest in my videos!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9WZv2mAG07o", "cid": "Ugx-h3u5mhelyb8rGKh4AaABAg.9dcpyIP2JY39eGoashAMuw", "comment": "\u00a0@thomasmennella5501\u00a0 Thank you for your answer sir.
