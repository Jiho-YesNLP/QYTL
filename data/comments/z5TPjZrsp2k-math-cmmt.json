In the plane we can have either clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, so let's define counterclockwise as the positive direction for rotation and curl. So, if I have a point with positive curl, then to the right of the point, that is, for x-values greater than that of the point, we will have upward motion. Similarly, to the left of the point we will have downward motion. So for lower x-values the vertical motion around the point is downward or negative, and for greater x values the vertical motion is upward or positive. So, around the point, as x increases, the vertical motion, which is the partial derivative with respect to y, increases. In other words, the rate of change of the partial derivative with respect to y, with respect to x, f sub yx or N sub x, is greater than 0 (in the case of positive curl). For the horizontal motion, which takes place above and below the point, the reasoning is similar. Above the point the motion is  horizontal and to the left, while below it's to the right. Above the point the partial derivative with respect to x is negative, while below it's positive. Since above the point the y-values are greater, we see that as y increases, the horizontal motion component decreases by becoming more negative. So the rate of change of the partial derivative with respect to x, with respect to y, f sub xy or M sub y, is less than 0 (again, in the case of positive curl). Since M sub y will be negative, but we want a positive result to indicate positive curl, curl is defined as N sub x - M sub y, because N sub x > 0 and -(M sub y) > 0. Curl is just the sum of the parts of motion indicating clockwise or counterclockwise rotation around a point, necessarily described by the second partial derivatives.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "z5TPjZrsp2k", "cid": "UgwZNb2C_vVTVOqluat4AaABAg.8h8YBC1tgNX9N3YX3blWeq", "comment": "Agreed", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "z5TPjZrsp2k", "cid": "UgwZNb2C_vVTVOqluat4AaABAg.8h8YBC1tgNX9SclMuU1b44", "comment": "same here...", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "z5TPjZrsp2k", "cid": "UgyhmFY1Yjb5hnLQACV4AaABAg.8ZpPT6HPpaI8_T4f1Wf75v", "comment": "Really wish the current professor verbally explained stuff more in his lectures.
