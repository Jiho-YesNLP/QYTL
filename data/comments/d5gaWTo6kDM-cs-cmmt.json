If it is deterministic then the value policy V(S) should be calculated based on the 100% chance of the direction in the optimal policy. For stochastic it would be, in this case, 0.8 in the direction of the optimal policy, 0.1 chance for left side of the optimal policy, 0.1 chance for the right side. Since the left side is already at the border, it would return back to it's original state hence 0.1*0.71", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "d5gaWTo6kDM", "cid": "UgzHPQypL4UstlICkAt4AaABAg", "comment": "Such a great lecture on RL!

Most folks are trying to get by best they can, and are likely to pursue \"exploitative\" strategies - what they know will bring them what they want.  But sometimes we explicitly launch exploration missions, and the \"success criterion\" of such a mission is very different from that of a \"profit oriented initiative.\"  The \"payoff\" for an exploration mission is *knowledge*.  I think keeping the two things cleanly separate is probably the way to go.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "d5gaWTo6kDM", "cid": "UgzOq2aywP7klckQMXl4AaABAg", "comment": "1:12:00 - I feel exactly the same mixed feelings that Dr. Ng seems to feel  here.  On the one hand, this technology is amazing, and there are so many wonderful things we can do with it, such as helping people get better medical care more quickly, and so on.  These things could save lives.  But there are also so many nasty things we can do with them; this general category of stuff is part of how we're.. sterilizing the world, so to speak.  Removing the \"humanity\" from things and making our culture colder, more clinical, and less empathic and compassionate.  I honestly don't know how to walk that tightrope - in cases like this \"if we don't do it, someone else will.\"  I suppose the best we can do is just try every day to keep some sort of \"human-ness\" in our endeavors.  Some of us will do a pretty good job of that - some of us won't.  \ud83d\ude1e", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "d5gaWTo6kDM", "cid": "UgyP7UkUPDucTUBXQup4AaABAg", "comment": "This is the best instruction among all videos on reinforcement learning.
