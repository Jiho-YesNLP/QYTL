I did a  phd in atomic physics but due to psychological -> psychiatric disorders I have to open something intellectual like a dip tea shop and then after learning how to do transactions, sell rubiks cubes and chess. I do make posts about atomic physics across my social media and run the codes once a while. Will be doing this or 30-60 years more and your lectures and demeanor offers inspiration.
