You just have to use it the right way. When I was in school, I was always bad at math and physics and I thought that there's something wrong with my brain too, and that I will never be able to understand it. Then, after my formal education ended, I started learning this stuff again on my own, because I needed it for my work and my hobbies, which quickly became my passion, and now I'm good at math, physics, chemistry, and more. I found better teachers, better sources of knowledge, better textbooks, than my schools could offer, and then I realized that there wasn't anything wrong about me \u2013 it was something wrong about my school teachers: they simply couldn't teach, because it wasn't their passion, and because they didn't understand well enough what they taught. From confusion you can only get more confusion. Someone who doesn't understand a subject well enough, cannot teach it well enough for other people to understand it either. So start from finding good teachers for yourself. As for the video lectures that you commented about: If you watch such a lecture and you feel that you don't understand much, it is probably a sign that either the teacher is teaching it poorly, or you don't have some important prerequisites for the material presented (i.e. there might have been some other lectures before this one that you missed where these things have been explained). But if you watch from lesson 1, and you still don't get it, start noting down every term that you don't understand. Then pause the video (either after the first unknown term that you encountered, or after collecting a bigger list of such terms), and start looking them up. You'll probably find loads of websites, videos and books that explain it, some of them might still be hard to understand, some of them might be easier, so start with those that you understand. And if you encounter another thing that you don't understand, then repeat this process again, recursively. Follow the trail of unknown terms, dig deeper, until you get to the roots that connect with what you already understand, and then trace back to the thing that you started with. It also helps to draw a map of these unknown terms and how they are connected, because then it will be easier for you to see what subjects you have to update your brain with.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Qg7pQ_CYaIQ", "cid": "UgykyAbMTL1Qp_XWjPN4AaABAg.9COxlOw36ba9CS5de5FJci", "comment": "She is a full professor at MIT.

The point is that you need quantum mechanics to describe this phenomenon (you don't have a chance to describe it classical) but you don't need a quantized electromagnetic field and photons is what you get if you quantize the electromagnetic field. To release electrons out of a metal you need a minimum energy W. This energy can be provided by an electromagnetic field. However, the observation is that the field needs to have a minimum frequency. If it is below this frequency you can't release electrons no matter how high the intensity is. What you can do is to calculate the transition probability that an electron in a metal with a classical electromagnetic field that acts on it will be released in a small time frame dt. This is where quantum mechanics come into play. By these calculations you figure out that these transition probabilities are almost zero if the frequency is smaller than  W/h with h as the planck constant. Note that there is no need for a quantized version of the electromagnetic field in these calculations.  I am not sure how to illustrate this without calculations. At least you need to have a deeper understanding of quantum states and how they change if you apply a field.  I don't know your knowledge. If you understand a bit of quantum mechanic calculations you can take a look here. https://www.physikerboard.de/topic,52217,-faq---zur-interpretation-des-photoelektrischen-effektes.html  It is German though but the equations are understandable internationally.

As for your first question though: They electrify the metal plate with that plastic rod that the dude in the red shirt had previously rubbed. This transfers additional negative charges (electrons) onto the metal plate, and since the plate is connected with the electroscope, it makes its needle deflect by repulsion. Once the UV light shines upon the plate, it gives those extra electrons more energy and they can escape from the plate, discharging it (making it less negative, as the extra electrons, negatively charged, escape from the plate), and the electroscope's needle is no longer repelled and goes back to its normal position.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Qg7pQ_CYaIQ", "cid": "UgxykGOSvKCO9QDQAoB4AaABAg.8pRcldYjKhU8pY_3ep3pVi", "comment": "Photon have relativestic mass Using equation E^2=(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2 Photon have relativestic mass m=p/c.
