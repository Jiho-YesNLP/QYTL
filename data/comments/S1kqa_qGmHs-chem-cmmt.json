If the crystal is SC, you should observe the peaks that make (h2 + k2 + l2) ratio look like 1,2,3,4...(Note all of them). However, the series is 3,4,8... . As for BCC, it is 2,4,6,8.., while for FCC it is 3,4,8,11... . Hence, the XRD pattern is more likely from a FCC crystal.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S1kqa_qGmHs", "cid": "UgwcwaPvFWi9V1qyM3x4AaABAg.9LtXXWzPbMF9TIVza8BIvy", "comment": "Same here", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S1kqa_qGmHs", "cid": "Ugzwiv7kn6sAr9cGpSF4AaABAg", "comment": "Excelente aula!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "S1kqa_qGmHs", "cid": "UgyRKv4T6y1GytUSLNx4AaABAg", "comment": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "S1kqa_qGmHs", "cid": "Ugx_N64-5NnMJXD6ldh4AaABAg", "comment": "Excellent lectures, lot of thanks to MIT for sharing these materials.", "votes": "10", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
