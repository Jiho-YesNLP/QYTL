First the finds the volume of an individual \"thin shell\",  it's 2(pi)(r)(height), because that's the area of the shell times the height for the volume of the shell. It comes from (Volume Shell 1) - (volume of shell 2), Which is ((Area 1)(Height1))- ((Area 2)(Height2)). Which is:  ( pi(r1)^2) h1)-(pi(r2)^2) h2), since this is a infinitesimally thin shell, height1 will equal height2 as r1 approaches r2. So we just have to worry about Area1-Area2, which is:  pi(r1)^2-pi(r2)^2=pi(r1^2-r^2)=pi(r1+r2)(r1-r2), as r1 approaches r2 it becomes: (pi)(2r)(dr), since r1 is almost equal to r2. Now it's(Area difference)(Height) for the infinitesimal shell, which is: (pi)(2r)(dr)(y), since y=height=Ce^(-r^2) it becomes  (Area difference)(Height)=(Thin Shell)=(pi)(2r)(dr)(y)=(pi)(2r)(dr)(Ce^(-r^2)),  The last term becomes (pi)(2r)(Ce^(-r^2))(dr), now we can integrate for volume by cylindrical shells.
