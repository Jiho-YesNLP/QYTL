When you have a pointer to some address in memory, and then you have a second pointer that will start from the first pointer and \"walk\" along the data structure, what do you say the difference is when both pointers are equal,. i.e. when the mobile pointer is pointing to the first element? The difference is zero, that's its offset. So to say you're grabbing the value at address `pointer + 0` (offset zero units from the start of the data) is to say that you're grabbing the first element. if `*(array + 0)` was equivalent to `array[1]` instead of `array[0]`, arrays would be a LOT harder to navigate and off-by-one errors would be a lot more common.  That's the real reason: Pointer arithmetic, file offsets, anywhere you are dealing with offsets (which turns out to be most of the time), zero indexing is more mathematically natural. Or if you're pushing elements into an array by using its length: `array[length] = value`, `memcpy(array + length, array2, MIN(availablesize, length2))`, and then `array` s length is incremented by the number of bytes added. It's simple. People only think it's hard because they deal with C strings which tack on an extra byte at the end while not considering it part of the array (strlen returns the length excluding the final byte).", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ix5jPkxsr7M", "cid": "Ugx3_qAHlwv6Wn1ryXt4AaABAg", "comment": "Goodness, jumping from Scratch to C sounds like a recipe for disaster. \ud83d\ude02 I've been writing programs for years and still haven't bothered to relearn C and C++ because I just never needed the extra performance (yet).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ix5jPkxsr7M", "cid": "Ugz95Y8ocIcTq6GrqMx4AaABAg", "comment": "in 1:36:37 - those random numbers which comes after 0.2000000 ... where they are come from?

The reasons why they suck is because in order to make even the most basic programs, they take about 3x as much lines of code, than a more modern language. Generally the more lines of a code the more work you have to do, the more likely you are to make bugs, the harder it is to design, the harder is to change stuff, the harder it is too understand, and the longer it takes to make something.   This is why its mostly just used for operating system development, and embedded development, where performance and precision , matters.  But most modern compilers in other language are built well enough to perform just as well as c and c++ code with less lines of code, so why make it more difficult for yourself? Again more lines of code just means its harder to maintain.   Since most people only like to use c/c++ for operating system development, and embedded basically if you want to do anything outside of that, you are very limited in terms of support. You wont have as many people that know how to code programs outside of that in c++, there wont be as much code or libraries you can reuse for your projects, then there is also a lack of decent tools, meaning you will have to make a-lot of stuff from scratch and your on own if you make errors.   Then portability is always a concern for c/c++ programmers, if you write code on mac, you will have a-lot of work to do to make that same code work on windows. Then with the current amount of stuff that's in c++ library, you could literally be studying the language for 10 years, and still come across code you have never seen before or used in a way you don't know about, Which is horrible if you are trying to maintain a project, who wants to constantly relearn an entire project when you want to make just a simple change?? \ud83e\udd74   These are just some of the problems. I made the mistake of learning as my first language, because you think of c++ as the first thing you when you hear about programming, and boy I regret it so much every day.

If you can code in C, your code will run on pretty much any device. Compatibility is not a huge concern. He is talking about this only because he probably heard one thing from other people or knows only CPP, which can be run under windows platforms. The majority of the functionalities of C are global.  C is perfect for literally anything you want to do if it requires EFFICIENCY. Modern languages are built on c, and they can't be as efficient as c no matter how developers try to improve it.   In terms of the library - anything you want is possible as long as you want to make it. Having to type some extra lines of code is beneficial because if something is more straightforward, it means you are probably losing something. Having everything ready on the side to make things is definitely not a good idea if you are not the author of those libraries since this will not improve your knowledge and will not add any kind of experience to you. If you are a beginner, sure, go ahead use ready-to-use things just for learning purposes, but using libraries just to make things easier, in the cost of losing performance, bloating your program? No, thank you.  Using libraries is not completely stupid, though, even if they are platform-specific. If you know that your program would be vulnerable to some sort of exploit, then go ahead and use the ones with thousands of commits over the years that were kept maintained and used globally and known to be industry standard.   As long as you want to improve yourself while keeping your code as efficient as possible, using pure C with no extra jazz is definitely the path to choose.
