Iron has the second most  tightly bound nuclei(Nuclear binding energy).  4-  THE FINGERPRINTS :  In The following verses God mentions his ability (in judgement day) to  recreate not only the bones/skeleton after decomposition in the grave,  but more difficult than that : the tips of fingers (this refers to the  complexity of each paerson's fingerprints) :  75:3 - Does man (a disbeliever) thinks that We shall not assemble his  bones (in the hereafter)?  75:4 - Nay, We are Able to put together in perfect order the tips of his  fingers.  5-  EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE :  Quran, 51:47 \"And the firmament, We constructed with power and skill and verily We are expanding it.  6-  BIG CRUNCH & ANOTHER BIG BANG (Cyclic universe hypothsis):  Quran, 21:104  \"The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books  ,- even as We produced the first creation, so We will also reproduce it :  a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfill it.  39:67  They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal, while the earth(s)  entirely will be [within] His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the  heavens will be folded in His right hand. Exalted is He and high above  what they associate with Him.  14:48  [It will be] on the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth,  and the heavens [as well], and all creatures will come out before Allah ,  the One, the Prevailing.  7-  Embryology:  The scientific translation of the verses of embryology:  Q22:5 O mankind! if you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then  lo! We (inform you that we ) have created you from a gamete/ovum , then  from a zygote , then from an Blastocyst/adherent , then  from a disc which is differentiated and not differentiated...  ABIOGENESIS (beginning of life) IN CLAY AND EVOLUTION (of man) FROM ANOTHER SPECIES :  Q23:12 And indeed We created man out of a species/progeny/life form which originated from  clay. (12) Thereafter We made him into a Zygote in a welcoming stable  lodging (endometrium). (13) Then We made the zygote into a Blastocyst/adherent , then We made  the Blastocyst/adherent into a disc , then We made out of the disc bones (notochord),  then We clothed the bones with muscles, and then We made him into  another creation. So Blessed is All\u00e2h, the Best of creators ------------------------------------------------ THE SURPRISE: Adam was a modern human who was created from a female like jesus . He was not the first man :  Quran 3:59 Truly, the likeness of Jesus, in God's sight, is as Adam's likeness; He created him from a gamete/ovum , then said He unto him, 'Be,' and he was being .  - The three germ layers & three prenatal stages :  Q39:6 He creates you in the bellies of your mothers, creation after  creation, in a threefold darknesses.  Notochord's function as axis for muscles attatchment : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notochord Endometrium receptivity: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409914/ Darwin's Beagle voyage: Quran 29:20: Say (O Muhammad to people) :\"Travel through the earth and observe/study how He(God) began creation \" 8-  THE PROTECTING FUNCTION OF EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE (from sun , meteors  ..etc):  (Qur'an, 21:32)  We made the sky a preserved and protected roof yet still they turn away from its Signs.  . The reflecting function of earth's atmosphere :  [I swear] by the sky which has returning/feedback properties . (Qur'an, 86:11)  9 -  PULSAR NEUTRON STARS :  \"( I swear ) by Heaven and The Knocker ! And what will convey to you  what The Knocker is? It is The Piercing Star ! (Qur'an, 86:1-3) \"  10-  THE PHENOMENA OF HYPOXIA (suffocation) IN OUTER SPACE  Quran 6:125  So who God wants that He guides him, He expands his chest to the  Islam/submission (to God); And who He wants that He misguides him, He  makes his chest narrow/tight , constricted , embarrassed as if (he)  ascends in the sky . Like that God makes/puts the obscenity/punishment  on those who do not believe.  11-  PHOTOSYNTHESIS:  Plants begin to produce oxygen at down.  Quran 81:18  And (i swear ) by the dawn when it breathes/sighs  12 -  EGYPTOLOGY EXCLUSIVELY IN THE QURAN  How & why the great pyramid of Giza was built ? Exclusively in The  Holy Quran:  Why the pyramids were built?:  The pyramids were alligned with some stars because Pharaoh of the exodus  somehow wanted to ascend or to find some celestial ways in order to  watch the god of Moses (perhaps they used to climb up the pyramid &  they also used it to project light up to the sky ):  Quran 40:36 And Pharaoh said, \"O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways -  40:37  The ways into the heavens - so that I may look at the deity of Moses;  but indeed, I think he is a liar.\" And thus was made attractive to  Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted from the [right] way.  And the plan of Pharaoh was not except in ruin.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMhIx6QEcp0  How the pyramids were built ? :  It is first discovered by Joseph Davidovits(material scientist) then  supported by Michel Barsoum(materials science researcher) that the  blocks of the pyramids are not natural . but they are just moulded  concrete bricks of clay ,lime & water then heated.  Quran 28:38  And Pharaoh said, \"O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god  other than me. Then ignite for me, O Haman, [fire] upon the clay and  make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I  do think he is among the liars.\"  http://www.livescience.com/1554-surprising-truth-great-pyramids-built.html  Experiment of building a pyramid by the owner of this theory:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FuJAbTmaLI  13-  PLATE TECTONICS & POLES SHIFT IN THE QURAN:  A . SUBDUCTION:  - Sea floor spreading subducted slabs:  Q15:19 And the earth-We had expanded it and CAST/THREW  anchors/stabilizers into it.  - The subducted slabs in the trenches prevent planet earth's poles  shift (crust displacement)by acting as anchors for the plates or by  distributing mass inside earth . Underground caves-rivers allow  scientific research:  Q16:15 And He had CAST/THROWN anchors/stabilizers into The Earth so that  it does not shift/sway with you ; and rivers, and paths(caves), so that  you will be guided.

MOUNTAINS:  - True Polar Wander Hypothesis ( A Planet's shift as a response to an  unballance in the distribution of landmasses):  Q 78:6-7 ''Haven't we made (planet) earth a prepared place /cradle and  mountains/landmasses as pegs/guy ropes?''  . Q21:31 And We have MADE in the earth anchors/stabilizers(mountains) so  that it should not shift  with them.  . Q41:10 And He made therein anchors/stabilizers (mountains) from above  it  .Q27:61 Is He [not best] who made the planet Earth a stable place and  made within it rivers and made anchors/stabilizers FOR it...?  .Q77:27 And We made lofty anchors/stabilizers(mountains) in it  Surface loading & plenet stability:  http://web.mit.edu/perron/www/files/Matsuyama06.pdf  The distribution of mountains as observed on planet Io :  http://www.niu.edu/geology/stoddard/publications/IO/iogrlandfigs.pdf  True Polar Wander hypothesis:  http://earthsky.org/earth/earth-is-undergoing-true-polar-wander-scientists-say  Find the correct translation here :  http://islamawakened.com/quran/16/15/\u3000  14-  MATHEMATICS:  .

That's an inverse exponential: for r=0 it intersects the vertical axis in a finite number b, it doesn't have an asymptote (which the graph in the video maybe seems to have, but it's not so clear).  And the \"RPD\", which would then be of the form b^2 exp(- 2a r), at r=0 is definitely not 0 but has the value of b^2. This returns to confuse everybody at 38:52 cause they're counting the origin as a \"node\".  Edit: I watched another youtube video and now it's clear her confusion at 24:41.

It is there, but it isn't noticeable since we do not go to values at r < 0.   As for the RPD, it indeed is explained wrong. The radial probability density is the wavefunction squared times the cross-sectional area, so it is not probability/volume, it is probability/radial distance. That's why it is 0 at r=0, because the area depends on r.  As for the integral that you talked about, the RPD is the probability of finding the electron in between the points x and x+dx.

It was written in Borland's Turbo Pascal for PC (and DOS), using CGA, EGA, VGA graphics cards. Our chemistry teacher showed us some book for inspiration. Obviously, our program did not solve Schr\u00f6dinger equations \u2013 we just tried to mimic 3D shapes that we saw in that chemistry book. Still, our program could draw the shapes in 3D (as \"clouds of points\", shapes similar to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Porbital.png ).   Edit: wikimedia deleted this image, help me find it! I could not find it anywhere, but wikimedia should not delete images permanently, right? Here is another depiction, not as good: https://i.stack.imgur.com/25yhY.png  We then made the program shareware and tried to sell it to schools for $5, protecting the program by scratching 5.25\" floppy discs to introduce bad sectors that would be impossible to copy, but that's another story. 28 years later, I would expect an online javascript app that would allow students to quickly see and compare all orbitals and their combinations based on real equations.
