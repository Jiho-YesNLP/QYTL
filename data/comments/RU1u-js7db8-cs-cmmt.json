The rate of real advancement of programming languages has slowed of late.  Mostly new languages are shuffling around existing ideas and in many cases copying old mistakes as though they were good ideas.  I will use an example:  If you want to deal with your location as one variable, you need to be able to hold 3 numbers in a variable rather than just one.  We usually call this sort of thing an array of numbers.  When the C language was created, they made it so that if you declared an array: int A[3]; What actually happened was a place in memory for 3 integers was allocated and \"A\" was made to be the location of the first element.  Thus you never really had an array variable but rather had a pointer to the array as your variable.  With simple variables \"X=Y\" would copy what is in Y into X.   With \"B=A\" for the arrays, you might expect 3 numbers to be copied but actually you would just end up with two pointers to the same location in memory.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UggibuqOQko1LHgCoAEC", "comment": "Yay for assembly code!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UgiEL5zIzvlqR3gCoAEC", "comment": "Load_Thanks", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UgggPX8b9T8C-ngCoAEC", "comment": "Psssshhhhhhh..

Computers are insanely fast, but games are also extremely complex, and we spend literal months researching and implementing performance improvements for a given title. That work is almost always re-used too. I.e. The engine we use (Unity) has thousands of programmers building off each others performance optimizations, and they're using the latest tech, and working closely with hardware manufacturers to utilize new developments. This is true of every large engine.   Example: A game running at 60 FPS means you have 16.67 milliseconds to do physics, gameplay logic, animation, audio, input processing, camera culling, rendering & shaders (which operate on each pixel), IO (reading/writing to disk), and network logic. You also need to give the OS time to do other things, and account for any instability (e.g. what happens if there is x2 more stuff to render on this frame).   I work on mobile games, and on our highest end devices, our game is roughly:  Input handling, gameplay & physics = 2 to 4ms Audio = 0.4ms Animation = 0.7ms Rendering - Culling (CPU) = 1 - 3ms Rendering - Other pipelining (CPU) = 3ms Rendering & Shaders (GPU) = 6-9ms Idle - The rest of the time.  Interestingly: Despite running smoothly at 60FPS, this amount of work is causing even our high end mobile devices to overheat. We are limited by battery life and device temperature, not by frame time. This is because modern mobile devices are designed for \"burst\" performance so they never hiccup. Annoyingly, some phone manufacturers don't even allow us to find out how hot they are getting (cough Apple cough), whereas others are providing API's that we can read from in-game to scale the game render quality down dynamically (Samsung, Google).  PC's and consoles are designed for sustained high CPU usage, so you should be able to use 100% of the 16.67ms safely (although some people will still crank things up too much and overheat their PC's).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UgjiJ7grGFOW4XgCoAEC.8SRWM3LaeHT8SR_epb5MZr", "comment": "Barnard Rabenold Not a programmer or anything, but I'd guess it depends on what kind of instructions are you giving to the computer.

Natural languages are poor choices to convey specific intent, especially English. New words pop into existence, and old words fall in usage, so you'd have to keep updating the compilers to keep up. Some words only stay in existence for a little while, and their meaning is extremely culturally tied (\"fleek\" is a good example). You need a more formal specification. Also, a lot of programming is pretty math-heavy, and it's really cumbersome to convey mathematical concepts in natural languages. Programs would probably get significantly longer as well.  For example, here's some Javascript:  [1,2,3].reduce((total, value) => total + Math.pow(value, 2), 0);  Now here's the same thing in English:  \"For a list containing one, two and three, compress them into a single value by going through each number of the list and adding its square to a total whose initial value is zero.\"  You can see how much more cumbersome the English is, and I'm not sure its meaning has even really been conveyed, even to a a person whose first language is English. Whereas, the Javascript can be understood by anyone who has taken the time to learn it. So, for making programs, we need a more formal language.

The key is in the translation output. An interpreter will read your code and perform the actions described itself, while a compiler will read the code and output translated code in another language. That language may be machine code, which would make assemblers also be compilers, but for most compilers it's another, intermediate representation. Clear examples are assembler, LLVM, SPIR-V, JVM, CIL or CPython's bytecode. The distinctive mark of assemblers is the direct correlation with machine instructions, but with things like macro assemblers and compiled languages close to specific machines even those lines blur.   No directly interpreted implementation of Python comes to mind. CPython, IronPython, MicroPython and Jython all compile to different virtual machines. Cython and Pyjs compile to other languages. PyPy actually does compile to native code, albeit with a high level of abstraction from the data semantics. https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations lists quite a few others, perhaps some of them do direct interpretation. Whether done Just In Time (which PyPy does) or Ahead Of Time, compilation of Python is the norm (and the compiler is in the standard library). The target being an interpreting runtime is also the norm. Ahead of time compilation of Python to standalone native code is not, however. Note that standalone itself is another nebulous criterion; most languages require some portion of runtime support in another language on most machines, and most programs run in an operating system. C runtimes are still written in assembly, if only to set up the call to main.   Python is a language that has traditionally interpreter-bound semantics and multilayered implementations. The lines between compiled and interpreted languages have blurred as either form of processing is possible for many languages; to some extent it is now more about how dynamic the semantics are, with possible introspection and self-modification, and Python is highly dynamic but does not typically process code objects themselves beyond generating them with the compiler and calling them. Some languages (for instance Nim) wrap the concepts the other way around, running interpreters within the compiler and outputting static code. Any machine code can be interpreted in a simulator, quite a few of which do JIT compile.   Stating that Cython is interpreted is incorrect; it is no more interpreted than a C-written extension module for CPython (though it has passed through one more compiler), or an assembler subroutine called from C code. It links with CPython's runtime and does not pass through the interpreter, which reads CPython bytecode. The distinction here is in portions of CPython; it contains a compiler, a bytecode interpreter, a Python library, a C runtime support library and a CPython module library. Cython code runs as part of the interpretation, adding to the CPython library. The program as a whole normally is interpreted as the Python code calling the Cython module is. For a comparison, consider the Firefox web browser. Would you call the entire program interpreted because its UI is partially controlled by Javascript code?   In the end, Python here only acts as a poor example if you're already knowledgeable enough to not need the example. It was likely chosen because it doesn't require other noise around the code, and is easily available to learn and use.

So yes, the industry programs in C/C++ most of the time, but it's not because people enjoy it. I code in C/C++ as well and I personally dislike the language. C++ especially has a problem that originated from its design philosophy, that code written 30 years from now should still be valid code. What this means is that throughout its history very few features have ever been deprecated, and when new functionality is added into the language it either becomes syntactically ambiguous or is wrapped inside of confusing namespaces structs or classes. For example std::unique_ptr<type>, it's a template type that helps with managing pointers and ensuring that you don't leave hanging pointers and etc. It helps with preventing memory leaks or managing memory. The problem is that the type is unique_ptr and the template type is the actual data type, the uniqueness of the pointer is the type and the actual type is a parameter of it. Most modern languages that have unique pointers have the uniqueness be an attribute of the variable instead, which makes far more sense both from a syntactical point of view and from a logic point of view. To make a variable owned someone simply needs to add a single syntactical change, to change the ownership of a unique_ptr you need to remove the unique_ptr the angled brackets, and then you need to actually make the object a pointer. That's a lot of changes to change a single attribute of the object. Talk to most people who have worked with C++ for several years and they will almost all tell you they don't like the language. The reason it's still the industry standard in many fields is simply because of the overwhelming cost to recode old infrastructure. You have millions of lines of code, or billions, that would need to be converted, you'd need to recode entire collections of libraries, etc, you'd then need all consumers to then download and use the new version.  Most people who know C++ and D say that switching to D would make the work environment have less friction , but that D is too similar to C++ *although without the legacy stuff that makes C++ bloated) and doesn't have any revolutionary feature that really makes switching practical. It would just take a very, very large amount of work to switch over, and because of this people tend to prefer staying with C/C++ even though many people don't like it, and are liking it less every update.  For me D just has some nice syntactical differences. One thing it doesn't have is headers. Headers are left over from years ago when compilers were less powerful and the linker needed to be fed more information about expected symbols. Nowadays modern compilers for modern languages can generate the equivalent of headers automatically, eliminating the need for using such a feature at all. Like C++ D does not need to be object orientated, you can just as easily run procedural code as object oriented code, however D have a more complete implementation of common OOP paradigms and concepts. D is similar to C/C++ in many ways, just without the bloat and legacy features and with cleaner syntax. It also combines C/C++ features with features from other more abstract languages like Python, Java, etc, only does them in a compiled program.  D's main problem is the lack of use. The lack of people using it leads to lack of libraries made for it, it also leads to less support smaller support communities, which leads to less documentation, and all of this leads to less people using the program and it's a continuous cycle. The other problem is that periodically D does change, unlike C/C++ D is not afraid to throw out old stuff that doesn't work like it should. almost all of these times the changes won't affect much code because the details that are changed are parts of the standard library which is hidden behind some abstraction, but for certain users who wish to get certain benefits out of a system these changes require you to test your programs efficiency and accuracy again and potentially change, which isn't that great for businesses.  +Mike Meyer that is false. First off, SQL is not a programming language, it's a query language, which is very different, secondly no, it's not the most popular. SQL or Structured Query Language is used exclusively to pull information out of databases, it is NOT used for general computing and in-fact is barely even Turing Complete without any extensions. C/C++ is the industry standard language for high-performance programs. Java and Python are also extremely popular languages for general computing. It is true that SQL is a language (not PROGRAMMING language, but language in general) that is one of the most in-demand in the industry, but do not for a single second think that means most popular, most used, most powerful, most useful, fastest or best programming language, because as I've stated several times, it's not a programming language, it's a query language, secondly it's fairly slow, it's bulky to use, etc. You really need to learn the difference between programming languages, scripting languages, query languages, markup languages, etc...

Mikes comments (now two of them) were both flagged as spam by others when I read them. If you're going to be so general about languages I guess technically, but scripting language are a very specific kind of programming language, with its own entire paradigm, it's own use. scripting languages are not generally used for general purpose computing or high-performance computing because scripting languages are usually either interpreted or loaded into the equivalent of a virtual machine. SQL is turing complete, I said barely turing complete because it's only been turing complete ever sense the persistence models were added not that many years ago. prior to that it actually wasn't turing complete at all. PL/SQL and T-SQL are programming languages but SQL98 is not, not without extensions. My point was mike called SQL the most popular programming language, which it's simply not, and then he says this is subjective, but it's not. popularity has to deal with how often it's used, for every SQL program, there is almost always a program that runs that SQL written in another language, like C/C++, and for every program that uses SQL there are hundreds that don't. There are hundreds of different ways to measure popularity. However none of them rank SQL at the top. The TIOBE index ranks PL/SQL at #19 with 1.676% rating versus 14.639 for Java,7.002% for C and 4.751% for C++ (based on a combination of factors ). The PYPL index doesn't even rank SQL in the top 22, Java gets 22.7% rating, Python gets 15.7% rating, PHP gets 9.3% (base on Google Trends reflecting search rates for languages). The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings doesn't have SQL in the top 20, with Javascript, Java and Python as the most popular languages (based on GitHub usage and StackOverflow questions), Indeed ranked Java as having more job offerings posted than the other languages combined,  a poll by StackOverflow showed that 55% of the developers on that site use JavaScript (not exclusively), IEEE's Spectrum rankings for programming languages ranks C, Java, Python and C++ as the top 4 popular languages (based on several factors. They have an interactive listing where you can adjust the weights of each metric to tune the ratings to your like. but only two of those metrics rank SQL in the top 10, Career Builder ranks SQL #2 in jobs offerings, and Dice is the only metric that ranks SQL #1 in job offerings). SQL is a common skill that employers want you to know, but in terms of how often it's used relative to other languages that are used for general purpose computing, it ranks very low. While SQL can do general purpose computing doing so with it wouldn't be an effective use of time. when it comes to big data SQL can be an efficient way to process large amounts of data,so that's about the only time you should bother using SQL for general computing, SQL's main job is manipulating data in databases.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UggNK-gGTcKjvXgCoAEC.8SOrXk8j9Nf8SOrzDUGDLL", "comment": "Or HTML.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UggNK-gGTcKjvXgCoAEC.8SOrXk8j9Nf8SOt3ofoP7W", "comment": "HTML is not a Programming Languages.", "votes": "44", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UggNK-gGTcKjvXgCoAEC.8SOrXk8j9Nf8SOtSgy8-kK", "comment": "Ze Rubenator HTML is not programming", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RU1u-js7db8", "cid": "UggNK-gGTcKjvXgCoAEC.8SOrXk8j9Nf8SOtf9KPU_S", "comment": "Trying to keep everyone sane...
