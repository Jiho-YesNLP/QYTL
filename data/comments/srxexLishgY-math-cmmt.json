This is established by the connection between invertibility (full set of pivots) and the determinant being the product of non-zero pivots. 31:12 \ud83e\uddee The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is found through the elimination process, and the formula is ad-bc. This is derived by understanding the steps of elimination on a 2x2 matrix. 35:34 \ud83d\udd04 Property 9: The determinant of the product of two matrices (A and B) is the product of their determinants. This property is valuable and distinct from addition properties. 36:31 \ud83d\udcc9 Using Property 9, the determinant of the inverse of matrix A is 1 over the determinant of A. This is derived by considering A inverse times A equals the identity matrix. 37:59 \ud83d\udd04 Property 9 extends to diagonal matrices, providing an easy check for determinant of products involving diagonal matrices. The determinant of A-squared is the determinant of A squared. 40:49 \ud83d\udccf Property 9 relates to the volume change when doubling the sides of a box (represented by a matrix). The determinant of 2A is 2^n times the determinant of A, where n is the dimension. 41:38 \ud83d\udd00 Property 9 aligns with the concept that if the determinant of A is zero, A is singular, and the inverse doesn't exist. The property is crucial for non-singular matrices. 42:07 \ud83d\udd04 Property 10: The determinant of a transposed matrix equals the determinant of the original matrix. Transposing does not change the determinant, but it affects the sign in the context of exchanging columns. 43:03 \ud83d\udd01 Property 10 indicates that exchanging two columns reverses the sign of the determinant, similar to how exchanging two rows does. This is demonstrated by transposing and using the properties 1-9. 47:11 \ud83d\udd22 The determinant is well-defined by properties 1-3, and it maintains its sign for an even number of row exchanges. This is a key fact established through algebraic reasoning.

Since L is lower triangular with 1-s on the diagonal  the k-th row of LUB is just the k-th row of UB to which multiples of multiples of  UB upper rows are added  4. you can see that step 3 does not change det (BU) since it is merely adding multiples of rows to  UB rows. So you are left with calculating det(UB)  By factoring out  u_k,k from the k-th UB row and using again the fact that adding multiples of rows to another row does not affect the determinant, you are left with:  det(UB)=u_1,1 * u_2,2 * ...* u_n,n* det(B) .  Since   det(A)=det(U) = u_1,1 * u_2,2 * ...* u_n,n  you finally get   det(A*B)= det(A)*det(B)   A better, more intuitive way to remember this property exist.

Making L unit triangular forces the LU factorization to be unique.\u00a0   The particular form of L here, Prof. Strang shows in earlier lectures, comes from combining the inverses of elimination matrices that have 1 on the diagonal.
