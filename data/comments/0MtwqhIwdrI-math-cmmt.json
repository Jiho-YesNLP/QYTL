The length of each column vector would be sqrt(1\u00b2+1\u00b2) = sqrt(2). So if we wanna \"normalize\" the vector , meaning turn it into a unit length vector  , then we just divide by the length. Since everything iin the matrix is divided by the same number , the dot product remains 0 (you can just factor the divisor out),and now the column vectors have length 1", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "0MtwqhIwdrI", "cid": "Ugz6lPyixhYGDNKB3R54AaABAg.99KPeMMIsXg9BP9a2GKa67", "comment": "\u00a0@DeadPool-jt1ci\u00a0 thank you so much!

Ax = b has no solution when b is not in the column space of A, meaning no non-zero combination of columns of A gives b. The best solution \\hat{x} expresses the projection of b onto the column space, p = Pb in the column space, so that p = A \\hat{x}. This means b is actually decomposed into p and the error vector e in the subspace that is perpendicular to the column space of A (left nullspace), i.e., b = e +p. This error vector has been dropped, but its length is minimized. 'Best' is in this sense. As the error vector is perpendicular to the column space,  A'e=0-->A'(b-A\\hat{x})=0, thus we have A'Ax=A'b.  Recall the projection matrix P = A (A'A)^-1A', which has an inverse when A has independent columns.  Alternatively, multiplying A' to both sides of  A\\hat{x} = Pb, we also get A'Ax=A'b.
