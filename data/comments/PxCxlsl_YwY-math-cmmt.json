As far Calculus 3, I think the best way to imagine that course is that you are simply doing \"Calculus 2\" in three dimensions. Of course, \"Multivariable\" really means that you are dealing with \"several\" variables, but the course tends to stick to a total of 3 variables, since this is possible to actually draw as visual graphs, and everything with a greater number of variables is analogous to 3D graphs anyway. Although some graphs that wouldn't be possible to sketch are still quite intuitive, like for example the temperature T in a room as a function of the x-, y- and z-coordinates could be written as T = T(x,y,z).  I study a 5-year university program called \"Engineering Physics & Electrical Engineering\", which is probably one of the most advanced engineering programs here (although I think \"Space Engineering\" is just as advanced). We took \"Multivariable Calculus\" at the end of our first year, and everything else that year was a lot of physics (largely reviews from high school actually, although slightly more rigorous and with some  new content here and there), linear algebra and single-variable calculus.  One thing that I can recommend is something called \"Laplace Transform\" - it can seem complicated in the beginning, but it's very straightforward when you have got used to the general idea (it's really just a specific type of integral that lets you transform a function in a very useful way). The Laplace Transform is extremely useful for solving differential equations, since it turns differential equations into algebraic equations, and this can be really useful for Calculus 3 as well.

But the introduction of several variables also adds some complexity, for example you will be working a lot with partial derivatives and slightly more complex integrals.

If we have a line in the form of y = mx+b we know that the slope is defined as m=(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) which is also (dy/dx). We can see that this is the rate of change in y to rate of change in x. So we can substitute this as sin(t)/cos(t) which also equals tan(t). We can take our original equation and convert it to y = tan(t)x + b. And this is just the introduction to how we go from a rate of change in linear equations to those of curves when we find a point on that curve that has a line that is tangent to it. Without the law of Cosines we and the applications of limits we wouldn't be able to differentiate! Everything I mentioned above and more is all embedded in the simplest of all expressions... (1+1). Consider 1 to be a unit vector that has + direction and a magnitude of 1. What happens when we apply the arithmetic addition operation of a vector to itself? We are applying a linear transformation which is typically called translation! It is also evident that there is perfect symmetry, reflection, and rotation in the expression (1+1).  And I have only involved an expression here not even an equation or a function! Everything in mathematics is embedded in 1+1 including negation, multiplication, division, exponentiation, roots, logarithms, vector notations, matrices, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus.
