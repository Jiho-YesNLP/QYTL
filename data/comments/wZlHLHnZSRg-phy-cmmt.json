Not in the way people think.  In a 12 gauge copper wire (2mm diameter), at 1 amp, a single electron moves  only  0.000023 meters per second.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity#Numerical_example  I'm going to figure out the exact physical nature of the magnetic field around the wire.  A couple things stand out:  1)  there are no electrons flowing down the wire.  How long will it take one electron in a 1 amp, 12 gauge wire to move one meter?   Distance = Rate x Time.    1 meter = .000023 meters/second  x  Time. Time =   1 meter /  .000023 meters/second = 43,478 seconds = 742.64 minutes =  12.1 hours  \"But that's just one electron.  There's millions of electrons.  You forgot about that.\"   No.  Every electron is traveling slower than frozen molasses,  .000023 meters/second, 1 meter in 12.1 hours.  So moving electrons do not create the magnetic field.  The magnetic field appears INSTANTLY the moment power is turned on (speed of light, just like the electric field) and the electrons are taking 12.1 hours to move only one meter.  And it's not the random movement of electrons either - the magnetic field around the wire would be random in that case, and the field is not random.  2)  the orientation of the (rotating) magnetic field around the wire is the same every time - right hand rule.  3)  it is a north magnetic pole - every time power is on.          I'm starting there.  The suspicion is that the field gradient is part of the reason for the consistency of the magnetic pole being north consistently.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "wZlHLHnZSRg", "cid": "UgxBWmyYPWLP4foEAZh4AaABAg", "comment": "Exactly how I like it: no 5-minute shit before the video starts, gets down to business at 0:00.", "votes": "3", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "wZlHLHnZSRg", "cid": "UgzRo7DdUj3oiVRG-3d4AaABAg", "comment": "This is a very organised explanation thank you but I just wanna ask if the two parallel wires having current in the same direction then the resulted magnetic field between them will be out or in the page", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "wZlHLHnZSRg", "cid": "UgwmYNCzIzmMzt2a53Z4AaABAg", "comment": "This is way helpful ever.. well done .
