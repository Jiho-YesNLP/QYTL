Combined with the fact that an expression can be used to assign a value within a tuple, the trailing comma is necessary in order to avoid semantic ambiguity.

In Python, this makes this value a string, because there is no comma within the braces. This is similar to (1 + 2), which doesn't create a tuple either.   The second one, t2, however, has a trailing comma ('cold',)  - This creates a tuple.   The tuples are created inline, therefore the braces are required to disambiguate the tuples from the parameters of the function call. However, the braces aren't even required to create a tuple. You could do  t2 = 'cold',  which would create a tuple (because of the comma).  This means that the call is actually   always_sunny('cloudy', ('cold', )). Therefore t1[0] gives you a c, but t2[0] gives you the whole string.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
