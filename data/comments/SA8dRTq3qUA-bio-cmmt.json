We figure without the specific molecules attaching to the area on the centromere, or other protein, that it is a charged bonding, but diminishes when the microtubule is disintegrated. Or, that ATP....> Adp is involved repeatedly continuing to charge/ hold the bond until the atp mitochondria are insufficiently produced. This would suggest that a surfeit of energy is necessary for a cell to split.  Ionic.  But never so simple - all those Krebs cycles are complex enough to maintain a consistent operating threshhold. Yet, cycling is a characteristic that allows for a circadian or other temporary optimality, with accumulation periods.  Cycling is a phenomenon that seems characteristic of life at allscales, as well as being niversal in physical universe, a characteristic of complex, system, as chaotic systems even exhibit occluded cycling, until addition or subtraction of energy bumps any system into different, but rather cyclic states.  This occurs even in mathematical equations with 3 or more independent variables.   There is no stasis in the universe. Stasis is an illusion fabricated by brains sensing scales of sufficient difference that motion, exchange of energy, is not useful insofar as a brain shaped by evolution to give attention to scales affecting the organism.  Inutility for trivial changes wouldn't be selected for as worthy of enough attention to form predictions from memory and macrosensory novel experiences.  I mean, to make simulations that matter, any brained animal has to distill, analogize, imagine some analog that imitates something worthy of paying attention to. We live in these heuristic fictions.  Science is the only generalization that must be internally & externally consistent, demanding replicability to be accepted, continuously. I suppose that includes swinging clubs and shooting projectiles.  There was no \"him\" going to be buried. It was already other things eating what he was, suppressed a bit by embalming chemicals.   We just usually don't get to see our friends bloating up with bacterial exhaust gases, and being et by things large & small. ( i do, and i like vultures because they, like us, eat the dead, turning them i to themselves.  I really loved being with a wolf who did that, until it happened to him, just as it will happen to you & me! We become part of something else, for a while, & then, something else.
