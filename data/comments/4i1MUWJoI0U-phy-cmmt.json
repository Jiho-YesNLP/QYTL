I understand that in the equation, a temperature decrease would balance a decrease in the volume of the container. But, by what mechanism does this happen? I can't figure out how decreasing the volume would cause the gas to cool. It seems to me like if anything, doing that would actually cause the molecules to move even faster, although to an imperceptible amount. And after all, as she said, we're doing work on the system, so unless there's an exit for heat, wouldn't the internal energy increase?

There are some proofs that the Law of Conservation of Energy is not always conserved and destroyed and not always constant.\r \r Computation proves that the principle of Thermodynamics is not always conserved and destroyed and constant.\r \r The applications of the explosion in the system of the principle of Thermodynamics.\r \r Wikipedia meaning of explosion:  An explosion is a rapid increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner.\r \r Illustration 1\r I. The mixture of compressed air and fuel on the piston of an engine is not enough to move the piston up and down. The explosions increase and created an energy of the cylinder causing the piston to move.\r The petrol of 10Joule is not enough to move the car, the explosion increases and created energy causing the car to move.\r \r Illustration 2 \r A 15 ball billiard pool to be strike by white mother ball. \r \r F = 30lbs (White Mother Ball); D = 3ft (Distance from the white mother ball to the first ball to strike); W = Work, F = force; D = Distance\r \r The mother ball to strike the 15 ball is the work input\r The first collision is explosion followed by an increase in force and travelled distance by individual ball followed again a series of collisions.\r \r The mother ball transferred the force to the group of 15ball. The momentum is conserved to the group of 15 while the explosion increases to 15 individual balls.\r \r SOLVE FOR WORK INPUT \r W = F X D;  W = 30lbs  x  3ft  =  90Ft.lbs          \r \r SOLVE FOR WORK OUTPUT \r W = F X D; W = 30lbs x 3ft = 90ft.lbs  X 15ball = 1,350 ft-lbs.\r It shows the Energy increase by 15times. The elastic momentum was conserved from one piece mother ball to the group of 15. However, the explosion after the collision increases the momentum into 15.\r \r Illustration 3 \r For more heat energy the ball to replace with steel ball and steel sideboard. After strike is explosions of 15 balls. The explosion increases the group energy into individual 15. The work output higher than work input followed by a series of collisions that produces more heat more work output, more sound energy more work output, more travelling distance more work output.\r \r Illustration 4\r To get even more energy output without increasing the work input. Put an additional two groups of 6balls in a triangular shape to be placed somewhere at the back of 15balls at least 4inches apart from the sidewall and back wall. A total of 15balls + 6balls + 6balls = 21balls. The explosion creates collisions after collisions increasing the energy output.\r \r After explosion the work done increased 21 times. That principle can use to make free energy machine.\r \r \r The Law of Momentum states that the total momentum of two or more objects acting upon each other does not change, without external unbalance forces.\r \r In this situation after the first collision is an explosion that increases the momentum from one body to multiple bodies\r \r \r \r Thank you. \r \r Abel Urbina Abel Urbina Free Energy Super Machine", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "4i1MUWJoI0U", "cid": "UgzRJtLmgYyjMiKDe9J4AaABAg", "comment": "Hey quick question for those interested. How much do you need to cool a solar cell operating at, let's say, 23% efficiency?  My thoughts are that a solar cell should not change its internal energt U, so in other words deltaU or dU/dt should be 0. So 23% of the solar energy becomes electrical work, while the rest of the sun's power (1-0.23=0.77) becomes heat that accumulates in the solar cell.   In order for dU/dt (delta U) of the solar cell to be 0 you need to fulfill Q=W, so in other words you need to cool the cell to such an extent that the only heat that isn't cooled off equals the electrical power of the solar cell, in this case 0.54 times the power of the sun?

Energy and matter can't interchange one another according to Einstein's famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out\u00a0 photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including heat and light are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. The most important aspect in thermodynamic is heat. What is heat? Heat is dynamic photons per volume per time. High heat means high temperature due to high availability of dynamic photons within a system as a result of the presence of a heat emitter. In the contrary, low heat means low temperature due to low availability of photons within a system as a result of the\u00a0 presence of a heat absorber.\u00a0Currently temperature has been defined as the average kinetic of atoms within a system. Why and how high temperature leads to high kinetic energy have not been explained? Likewise\u00a0why and how low temperature leads to low kinetic energy of atoms within a system have not been explained too? Without any doubt that photons is the missing link between temperature and average kinetic energy. Higher temperature means higher availability of photons will lead to higher kinetic energy of atoms within a system after they have stockpiled more stationary photons from a heat emitter. In the contrary, lower temperature means lower availability of photons will result\u00a0to lower kinetic energy after atoms within a system dissipate more photons to the surrounding that absorbed by a heat absorber more than the one that they absorbed from the surroundings that subsequently leading them to have lower kinetic energy. Thermodynamic is all about heat (dynamic photons in particular). We should exam on how\u00a0dynamic photons interact with atoms within a system that\u00a0leads to work done rather than relying on some mathematical equation to explain thermodynamic phenomenon.

Order and disorder are very ambiguous terms and one can be confused for the other.  But if you think of it like bouncy balls in a container, you realize they will spread out, and the likelyhood of them being in any particular configuration is small.  Basically things become distributed.  A balanced coin given enough flips, will be near 50%, a 6 sided die will eventually have 1/6th chance for each number to be rolled.  A coin has less entropy than a 6 sided die, because there's more states a 6 sided die can take.  A molecule of air moving in a 2d plane has 360 degrees of freedom, all equally likely, so it's easy to see how in a 3d world with so much interacting the amount of entropy is insanely big.  One person's ordered chess board might be another person's mess, people can define order as simply a state they find desirable so ti's entirely too loose a term to truly understand why when you put a drop of color into a water bowl, the water bowl becomes evenly distributed in color over time.  Yet, one person might say that the system started out disorderly (non uniform) and became orderly (uniform distribution of color)  when in fact, this is exactly what entropy is, in action.  The molecules distributed evenly.  Heat does the same, and it's all driven by the same statistics as that flipping coin.

First let me state, that this is fundamental, classical physics and can be found in any major textbook on physics, thermodynamics or physical chemistry, so it's nothing that I make up. The basis is that humans by observation found out, that reactions seem to have a preferred direction. E.g. a ball falls from a table to the floor, but it never spontaneously jumps from the floor onto a table all by itself, or hydrogen and oxygen spontaneuosly react to water, but water never spontaneously dissociated in large amounts in to hydrogen and oxygen, although all of these reactions are perfectly possible on a molecular level. So why is that ? The answer to this question is that when these reaction occur, the entropy of the closed system (the universe) increases. This understanding resulted in the formulation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics which is: The entropy of the universe always increases. This means, that reactions, that reduce the entropy do not happen spontaneously. You can \"force\" these reactions to happen (e.g. in the case of water via electrolysis), but this requires the use of energy, If you use energy a part of this energy dissipates into heat, which increases energy and overcompensates the entropy decrease of the reaction you enforce using energy. Meaning that the net entropy of the reaction is now positive (entropy increases) and now can occur. One can have different views of what entropy exactly is. In my opinion the best interpretation is the statistical interpretation by Boltzmann, but in the end it means all the same: entropy equals a higher degree of freedom and therefore less order. I'll give you an example: lets look at Fe (iron), once solid and once gaseous. If it's solid, the movement of a single Fe atom is blocked by all of it's neighbors, but of you just make the block of iron hot enough it first melts (the Fe atom is still interacts with it's neighbors, but less strongly (the structure is less ordered) and if you heat it more, the Fe becomes gaseous and finally a plasma. From crystalline (solid) over liquid to gaseous and finally plasma the interaction of a Fe atom with it's neighbors decreases, therefore it is less blocked in it's movement and the entropy increases. The heat is just required to overcome the bondings. Something that would otherwise happen by itself, although it would take possibly billions of years. That's more or less the direction the nature moves and will end in the \"heat death of the universe\". (you might want to look this term up) This becomes more obvious when looking at an examples: take a bucket and separate it into 2 halves with a sheet of glass. Into one half you fill 1l of cold water, into the other half you fill 1l of hot red water. Then you remove the glass plane separating the halves. What's happening ? Well, both sides could stay separated (like oil and water would do), but they don't. Wait a few minutes and you will have a homogeneous some pinkish, hand-warm water in the bucket. This is because by mixing the entropy increases as the mix is less ordered than the parts staying separated. Basis for all of this is in the end statistical of molecules, atoms and particles together with the fact that the number of ordered states is much much much less than the number of unordered states (e.g. you there is just 1 state in which the numbers from 1 to 10 are ordered by size, there are some combinations that show order (e.g. from 10 to 1 by orer, or first uneven then even etc) but the overall number of combinations is 10! (which is 3628800) and practically all or them are unordered. Don't forget on the molecular level we are not talking about 10 things, but already about 6,22*10^23 molecules in just a single mol), so in the end entropy is just a statistical effect, because ordered states are so much less likely than unordered, which is why the overall entropy in the universe (the degree of unorder) is continuously increasing. (It could theoretically also decreases, but this is so incredibly unlikely that it will certainly have never happened during the lifetime of the universe until now.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "4i1MUWJoI0U", "cid": "Ugiho94SLjisZ3gCoAEC.8Irs4isu-eR8MsmYKbcw3n", "comment": "Dennis Haupt 1) You got something wrong here. There are 3628800 possible permutations of the numbers from 1 to 10, where each can just occur once. Every single one of these permutations is obviously equally likely. How likely is it that 1 to 10 ordered by increasing size will be the outcome ? Exactly 1 / 3628800. How likely\u00a0 is it that 10 to 1 ordered by decreasing size will appear ? Also 1 / 3628800. Lets say there are not only these 2 but around 23 additional permutations where a human will be able to detect some sort of \"pattern\" (any kind of order) in the permutation of the 10 numbers. If so, we end up with 25 overall ordered states. This means the likelihood of ordered systems is (rule of thumb) 25 / 3628800. This means the likelihood of all others (=unordered)\u00a0 is 3628775 / 3628800 or 1 - 25 / 3628800 which is in first approximation nearly 1. The more particles bigger the difference in likelihood between \"ordered\" and \"unordered\" states (with 2 particles, we are at 50% each). You can do the maths by yourself. Instead of the numbers 1 to 10, just take the numbers 1 to 10^80 (10^80 is roughly the assumed number of particles in the visible universe) and you'll see. So the more particles, the closer the likelihood of all particle particles winding up in an unordered instead of an ordered state. So with increasing number of particles the likelihood increases until it is practically 1 (that is 100% chance), without ever exactly reaching it. So the more particles, the higher the likelihood, that entropy. That's simple maths and the basis of the second law of thermodynamics. This game continuous until the entropy in the universe is maximized, so the universe is in equilibrium and nothing happens. No stars no life, no radioactivity, nothing. verything is has ended / is dead. That's the aformentioned heat death of the universe and bothered quite a lot of scientists in the midst of 1800s when all of this was first discovered/understood. 2) It's fine if you can imagine such things, but that's perfectly irrelevant.What's important in science is, what can be measured and observed, not what can be fantasized. Personal believes or fantasies are completely irrelevant. The only thing that counts is measurable data and the its interpretation, not wishful thinking. If you want that, that's religion, not science. Fact is that the universe behaves in a way that only actions take place spontaneously that lead to an overall increase of entropy in the universe. The reason for this is given by Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of entropy. So in the end by maths. Entropy increases because the likelihood that it increases is so much greater, than the likelihood that it does not. BTW, this is also the explanation for the infamous \"arrow of time\", so why time seems to irreversibly flow just into a single direction from the past into the future, although all events should be (and in principle are) reversible. It's simply because the likelihood of this flow is practically 1, while the likelihood of moving from an unordered to a more ordered state is practically 0.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "4i1MUWJoI0U", "cid": "Ugiho94SLjisZ3gCoAEC.8Irs4isu-eR8MsqzFmV1Fo", "comment": "Frank Schneider I love how you are explaining entropy... but again, it has nothing to do with order or disorder. again, the idea of order and disorder don't make any sense as its a human construct. I can say that perfect equilibrium, the heat death, is a perfectly ordered system. just like when you sum all the possible combinations of waves in a string, you will get a flat line. so...  by your point of view, if I pick n numbers from 1 to 10000 in any order, the likelihood for me to pick them in ascending order (what you would call a ordered system) is smaller than picking the number in any other order, but so is any specific combination, every number has the same likelihood or being picked at any given time, it just happen that the combinations we consider \"disordered\" compose a bigger portion of the possibilities, so its more likely that I'll pick them in such a order... but again, I can find any pattern from any sequence of numbers I'm given, and then I can say that the quantity of sequences of numbers I can pick with discernible patterns is bigger than those without any discernible order, it all depend on me, I'm the one that decide if a system is ordered or not.  another example is the classic mix of milk and coffee. there are more possible combinations of molecules of coffee and milk where they are mixed than there are where they are perfectly separated like water and oil. but even though they are not combined in a single entity, but actually floating around each other, I can say that they are actually a perfectly random system, like a noise pattern. one can say that a noise pattern is disordered, but if I separate the mixture in small chunks I can find that each chunk has extremely similar number of coffee and milk particles as if it was deliberately organized so the numbers of particles will match... so, should we consider it ordered or disordered ? you can, of course, say that the system is chaotic, because of chaotic dynamics, and that is where I believe the idea of entropy as \"disorder\" came from. but try to call a Chaotic system \"disordered\" and Lorenz itself will come from the grave to punch you in the face", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "4i1MUWJoI0U", "cid": "Ugiho94SLjisZ3gCoAEC.8Irs4isu-eR8Msv7aJF9Kg", "comment": "Dennis Haupt 1) Nice try, but you can't simply define the problem away. Let's take air for example and for simplicity's sake initially assume every N2 and O2 to be single particles and ignore the rest. Now assume that every particle can move along the x axis free at will. If we have one particle, it can move either in x or in -x direction. If we have 2 particles p1 and p2 then there are 4 combinations, p1 and p2 both in x, p1 and p2 both in -x, p1 in x and p2 -x or p1 in -x and p2 in x. We can now go on and play this game for more particles. The result is, that with increasing particle number, the chances that it significant part of all particles moves into a specific direction is reduced and the chances that more or less the same number of particles move in x and -x direction increases. As a result will states the deviate further from this average spontaneously move towards the more likely state as this is more likely. Entropy has increased. We can now increase this first by adding the y and z direction and thereafter by adding the further degrees of freedom of rotation and oscillation. That's the bases.

However you wanna call it, nature doesn't care and moves into the direction in which, what ever you might call it, increases. That's an observable fact. And one of the most fundamental laws of physics. If you don't agree that's fine. You simply need to falsify it and you'll get the nobel prize. I actually like your milk and coffee example as in this case pouring milk into the coffee will indeed increase entropy, but you and also I know that chaotic systems are highly ordered systems that can be described by by simple differential equations but strongly depend on initiation circumstances, so that the behavior of the system simply can not be predicted in the long run. So no reason for Mr. Lorenz to return from the grave to beat me up. Such a system (if we assume it to be chaotic in the first place) might be unpredictable, but it's of course still highly ordered. But if we have a chaotic system here or not strongly depends on the circumstances (e.g. how I pour the milk and how I stir). Fact is, we have a state, towards which the universe moves, which is that of increasing entropy. Call it what you want, but this doesn't make it go away. It's like gravity, you can pretend it doesn't exist, but this will not prevent you from falling if you slip. BTW if your coffee it into small chunks, you'll find that on a microscopic level, the mixture is not 100% in every chunk, this happens only on a higher level (bigger chunks), as entropy is a statistical effect of BIG numbers, so of you select the chunks small enough, even at max entropy you'll see deviations. E.g. on microscopic level all elementary reactions are in principle reversible, while on a macroscopic level they are in fact not (which is why we experience time).

There has been an increasing trend since around 1970 and onwards. If you plot a linear line, you'll see a positive slope. Only by going back to 1880 and taking the average temperatures up until now will you not see much change. From the data, it looks like the earth is heating up faster than the ice can compensate. This means that both the ice is melting and the land surface is getting warmer. And since the temperatures on land are less stable than the oceans, we will feel the effects first while the ice slowly melts. The sources are below.

The curve should not show a relatively linear (and therefore constant) but a continuously increasing growth in T. E.g. if you compare the T increase with the increasing global CO2- etc. emissions (e.g. here https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data), you'll see the average T-increase is by far not as high as it should be. This of course doesn't mean that the causality is broken (or doesn't exist at all), but that there are effects responsible for this discrepancy. One is of course lag. It simply takes some time to show an effect on a global scale. If I increase/decrease the CO2 emission in China today, T in Mexico will not increase/decrease tomorrow or even next year. Another (and more important effect) is buffering. This means we'll see the real increase in average T only after the ice-buffers (and especially Arctica) have been fully eliminated. It's like heating an iced drink. T of the liquid will stay at 4\u00b0C as long is there is ice in it.

I'm more concerned with whether the Earth is heating up or not, which you have said no in your first comment. Based upon previous data, the average temperature is increasing even though the ice is absorbing some of the heat. So even with ice buffering, it's still getting warmer. We're still seeing an increase in temperature in the past few decades, even with ice buffering. Until later data shows that the average temperature drops significantly to offset the current temperature increase, then you can talk about ice buffering having a major effect.
