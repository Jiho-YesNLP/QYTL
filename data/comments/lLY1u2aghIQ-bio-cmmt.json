I find it more intuitive to consider the rates of change of E, S, ES, and P with respect to the diagram. I also thought his attempt to describe the problems with the schematic diagram was more confusing than elucidating. I think working through the derivation (when properly understood) provides the intuition necessary for the equations to become clear. Once caveat to this is I have a strong math background, but even for those without (assuming differential calculus is a prerequisite) it should be more clear.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lLY1u2aghIQ", "cid": "UgyAIyM5TWd1dYPaP3V4AaABAg", "comment": "He mentions that the [ES] inhibitor would produce a curve where Km is not affected while the Vmax is affected, which isn't the case.

However, it will be very helpful if you are comfortable with the material in Introductory Biology 7.012, Differential Equations 18.03, and Probability 18.05. In addition, each weekly problem set will have a computational problem, so prior experience with a computational package such as MATLAB\u00ae, Mathematica\u00ae, or Python is expected. The \u201cofficially supported\u201d package will be Python (sample code, etc), but problems can be done in any language.\" Visit the course on MIT OpenCOurseWare for more info at: http://ocw.mit.edu/8-591JF14.
