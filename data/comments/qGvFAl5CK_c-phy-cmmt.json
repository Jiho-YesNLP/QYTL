But not all students can immediately understand what the professor teaches in only one sitting. This video gives a great introduction to static equilibrium as this topic is very important for engineers. It is essential since it is the engineer's responsibility to develop and construct a structure that is stable and does not fall, slide, or tilt.  Static equilibrium is not an easy lesson and there are many formulas that need to be remembered but the lecturer of this YouTube channel gave an easy-to-understand explanation of the topic so that students could understand it right away. He also gave real-world practice problems to further deepen the students' understanding of static equilibrium. Furthermore, the ability to rewind a tutorial video on social media will be very helpful to learners if they are having trouble understanding a part of the lesson they are studying. The video is a guide for students to clearly understand those complicated topics. However, it is crucial that students have their notes from discussions with their professors that could be a big additional help upon reviewing the topics that had been tackled.  #Surviving #TheFutureEngineers #NextGenerationEngineers", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgyWLjKjm-Sc_fIaKM54AaABAg", "comment": "At 55:15, is the angle measure between the forces really supposed to be different to the angle measure between the ladder and the ground?

If the force equations alone would suffice, there's no need to use torque. However, in most problems in equilibrium and elasticity, all the needed variables can't be solved through force equations alone. And when that happens, you can utilize the torque equations to satisfy all the needed variables. :)", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgzzY7SE5mm_L0TSWZh4AaABAg.8vD1oUHFi1h9AIkSJR9br5", "comment": "\u00a0@eloisamarietulay5331\u00a0  Nice explanation\ud83e\udd14", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgwNe_O4EcOjPVlMSCR4AaABAg.8u-H-MN1z_O9IwaeFOEtAF", "comment": "Furthermore Hinge/Pin Connections ( like the ones on your door) free to rotate (which most are) always support a force in the X and Y Direction", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgzJal-AJV7QWBi7t2V4AaABAg.8tfW5UDLMEH9l6UkdZSeaA", "comment": "HK? more like hoe killer", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgxQoWu7wTkO-iA5Lh94AaABAg", "comment": "on question 32.00 i just wanted to know in some cases when the angle given from the hinge and there is no moment given why we use cos", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgwgYm4uIYeUACQPBD54AaABAg", "comment": "How did people pass these classes before YouTube and TOCT?!", "votes": "7", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "Ugx3eWi7XW_2qcwvE-14AaABAg", "comment": "any other AP1 ppl cramming for a quiz?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgzsPSiNMFslcsCvXf54AaABAg", "comment": "Thank u.. at first its so hard to understand because its something new for me..but until the last example, I understood \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc95", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgxTbNMqOGz4ZsY2eXB4AaABAg", "comment": "Excellent work god bless u", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgxYcKQK6vBzXmotK914AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you very much for your hard work on this video.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgzFv5shieL1QwexEoV4AaABAg", "comment": "Last example is false:the Hypotenuse of 12and 9 is under 15m Long!!!!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgyIK4cqce9zZG-f95d4AaABAg", "comment": "goat", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgyAj21bpJ_l2FXpX7F4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks alot  But I what is the name of the man behind this screen i get confused when i decide to recommend it to a friend.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgzgzytQnKhShHX_I-B4AaABAg", "comment": "You are AMAZING thank you so much", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgwKg3vltLDV5n4aKud4AaABAg", "comment": "i am not native English speaker but i still understand it way much better than explanation of my school teacher", "votes": "8", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "Ugyh1Rm7GT3RyBV_Yup4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you for all that you do. you have helped me more than you know", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgzjLI5J6Ap8w6J4Qm14AaABAg", "comment": "32:08 tension force prob 44:06 ladder", "votes": "215", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgyolZ9H0sfu6Nb3hip4AaABAg", "comment": "You are a general teacher indeed, i appreciate>", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qGvFAl5CK_c", "cid": "UgwURLpnH78vdpN9Gi14AaABAg", "comment": "Plz answer OGT....
