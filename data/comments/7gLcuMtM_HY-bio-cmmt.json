I have finally applied this from my research to success. This frequency oscillation does break up the Covid Formation and then it is excreted out, even if the Covid Formation was implanted in the body from a vaccination. \r \r Without this removal of the Covid Formation, it will likely stay in the body permanently, for the rest of one\u2019s \u201clife\u201d.  It appears to grow, and by its very existence, causes constant damage by energy drain, infections held-in-place and also constant blood clotting formation. Concentrations of Covid Crystals are so far found in the lungs and heart.  This goes away with breakup and it is then flushed out by the body. It is likely, that from other toxic contents of the \u201cvaccine\u201d that people will have other problems, as Chromosome damage, that will result in long term problems of many sorts.\r \r What I also see, is that people that get Covid and/or Vaccinations are being permanently effected by Covid formation, in their bodies, even if they did not even get very ill with Covid or the Covid vaccination. Many of those that get Covid and \u201cget over it\u201d still have a low lying infection in their heart and lung areas as well as some blood clotting, that stays with them, until the Covid crystals are destroyed and expelled.\r \r There also seems to be other infections (held in place) in different parts of the body, caused by these Covid formations. Some people contract Covid and do not even get very ill and do not recognize that they have Covid and so it lies hidden to them and very subtly works against their good health. Unwittingly, they are carriers and spreaders of Covid. They sometimes say, \u201cI have never had Covid\u201d!\r \r It has recently been admitted that the Covid Identification Tests are very poor and miss a lot.  The recognition of Covid being concentrated in the lungs and heart and findable with x-rays, was by an independent Researcher and this works.  In my own tests, a high percentage of people now are carrying Covid, inoculated or not and do not know it.\r \r Let\u2019s say your stress reduces and you feel a little better.  With a Covid Formation Implant in the body, a person can be resonated with a Covid Growth Wave-Form (from the air/sky or piggybacked on a radio/communication site) or breathe or ingest a solid form and it will once again potentially take hold and cause untold damage and even death. So, then are we presently being set-up to just be \u201csitting ducks\u201d so to speak? After everyone is implanted with this Covid, or share it, will they then become puppets that can be dominated/manipulated or killed? Is Global Depopulation starting?  \r \r Is this system becoming \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d, \u201c666\u201d, prevailing over us, where we cannot engage in business or commerce, without the \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d or the \u201cNumber of his Name\u201d? (A Green Passport) Or we can be forced to do things we know are against God\u2019s teachings and values?  This violates our freedom of Religion!  Insurance companies are now writing clauses they won\u2019t cover Covid.  Threats are coming that people can\u2019t work without an inoculation.  Maybe they are banned from stores.  Businesses are closed.  Federal medical care, that you pay for with taxes, is now being considered to be withheld from you if people don\u2019t get inoculations...\r \r Despite much prior speculation on Earth, here is a new thought. A God whisper. In Kabbalah, the way the spiritual number system works, is that each letter has a spiritually assigned numerical value, from 1 to 22 letters. You add-up all of the numbers for the letters of a word, for example, and then reduce the total to any number below ten (10).\r  \r After I wrote the first main part of this article it occurred to me to look and see if the letters for \u201cCovid\u201d answered up to numerical scrutiny and they for sure do. Most of us have never learned this. Let\u2019s try this. Covid is C-11, O-16, V-6, I is 10, D is 4.  This becomes =47. Then if we add 19 to that, we get 66. Only two \u201c6\u2019s\u201d of the mentioned three. Let\u2019s take another word, \u201cCorona\u201d. The numbers for the letters of Corona are 11,16,20,16,14 and 1 and add up to 78. Reduced is 7 + 8 is 15, that then reduced again to 5 and 1 = 6.  Now you have a tiny lesson in Kabbalah. \r \r In Hebrew, the Numerical Value of \u201cCovid 19\u201d is 66 in their letter/number system. Where is the other 6?? Taking the letters of the word \u201cCorona\u201d in Hebrew, you find the other 6, so then in the words Covid 19 and Corona are 666 total. Are the enemies of God laughing at us, now and again?\r \r Remember that Faith Without Works is not viable! In the book \u201cThe Art of War\u201d, by Sun Tzu, one of the Axioms is that, \u201cWars are costly and so it must be done in such a way that your enemies are made to pay for this war\u201d. Paraphrased! Who is paying for The Covid Dominion? We The People are! Taxes, addictions and support of Toxic Businesses/countries fund the placement?\r \r My prayer is that the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth will come out and be disseminated far and wide in a good timely way! Know the truth and the truth will set you free, even from diseases. \r \r It is important to have good quality parts in a Sine Generator, so the signal is properly formed.
