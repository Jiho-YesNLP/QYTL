Calculate the length of this vector, you get \u221a(10/3*10/3 + 5/3*5/3 + 10/3*10/3) = \u221a(225/9) = 15/3.   Then finding the orthonormal vector i.e., u2/(length of u2).   (1 / (15/3) ) * 5/3*[2 1 2] = 3/15 * 5/3 * the vector which results 1/3 * [ 2 1 2]  which also can be written as [ 2/3 1/3 2/3] .
