In CSMA/CD for any station to detect a collision, the Transmission time(The time a station takes to put a packet on the line) must be greater than the time it takes to reach the destination(propagation time)+time it takes for collision signal to reach the station. The maximum of both of these times is propagation delay. So here Transmission time >= RTT(time to propagate packet+collision signal) In this way the station can detect collision while transmitting packet, abort the operation and restart after some time(Back off).
