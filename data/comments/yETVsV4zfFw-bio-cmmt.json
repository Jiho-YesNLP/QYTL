After a while it becomes so tiring, even painfully intolerable. Tom feels that he has to imitate our Incredibly Learned Professor's style with a vengeance, but his performance comes out like a gross, insane, often absurd caricature. It is a kind of juvenile exhibitionism, a fun game playing the role of an outrageous circus barker, for his own personal enjoyment, and in disregard of its effectiveness on the target audience. We can tangibly feel Tom's lack of experience in teaching and communicating. Instead of knowing when and how to emphasize a key point, as a good boxer does, his continuous frenetic arm waving obscures his oral explanation and becomes a turn-off. It is so intolerable that this gesticulation  leaves us exhausted, pining for the genuine teaching style of Prof. Sapolsky.\u00a0 Fortunately, there's a saving grace in this lunacy. The slides are highly instructive material, the meat of the immensely important topic of hormones. And, an unexpected boon, they are displayed in the video, something we don't get in most of the other videos of the full 25-lecture course. After having watched them all more than once, this #12 remains by far the most excruciating one to watch, but with some very good  slides. I usually try to slide through the Tom bits, limiting myself to picking and focusing on the slides, and listening to William.
