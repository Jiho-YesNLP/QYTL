Let's break it down:\r \r *1. Physics:* When you throw a ball into the air, its height can be modeled by a polynomial function. The equation includes terms for gravity (a constant) and the initial velocity of the ball.\r \r *2. Engineering:* Structural engineers use polynomial equations to design bridges, buildings, and other structures. These equations help predict factors like stress, strain, and load distribution.\r \r *3. Economics:* In finance, polynomial functions are used to model things like supply and demand curves, cost functions, and revenue functions. This helps businesses optimize their operations and maximize profits.\r \r *4. Medicine:* Polynomial equations are used in medical research to model things like growth rates of tumors, drug absorption rates, and population growth of diseases.\r \r *5. Computer Graphics:* Graphics software uses polynomial equations to render 3D objects and animations. These equations help determine the shape, position, and movement of objects on the screen.\r \r So, whether you're calculating the trajectory of a rocket, designing a skyscraper, or analyzing market trends, polynomials are there, quietly doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes.\r \r Hope that clears things up for you!", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "UgyaReOgOa4v2XIfT9B4AaABAg.9o_ORXWx7By9o_Q8p2HdSX", "comment": "This is a math tutorial, chief.", "votes": "18", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "UgxYPNOQK-5iggbNHtZ4AaABAg.9_Te8GNu6s19prB2shBNli", "comment": "are they?", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "UgxYPNOQK-5iggbNHtZ4AaABAg.9_Te8GNu6s1A6SJkBKXJNr", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@ChainsawChristmas\u00a0yes they are", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "UgxYPNOQK-5iggbNHtZ4AaABAg.9_Te8GNu6s1A6iqjy-TTOH", "comment": "\ud83d\ude01", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "Ugw35nYdRQ4MhI1oB1F4AaABAg.9S65QZLNHsI9YzheGARTKS", "comment": "No please come back, math will only get more fun as you go further into it.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "UgxKuDF2AMAbshS-vYB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks once again!", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "nPPNgin7W7Y", "cid": "UgzxTEqiQYTgYD1oeJp4AaABAg", "comment": "Woah.. my mind is blown..
