[00:00] This video summarizes the characteristics and classification of living organisms according to the Cambridge IGCSE syllabus - Biology is the study of living things with seven characteristics that define them - Mrs Gren is a mnemonic to remember the seven characteristics of living things - Classification systems group organisms that can reproduce to produce fertile offspring  [02:41] Classification is the process of grouping organisms based on shared features - Binomial system is an internationally agreed system for naming species using genus and species - Dichotomous keys are used to identify organisms based on a series of questions about their features - Classification allows the subdivision of living organisms into smaller groups based on shared features  [05:24] Classification systems aim to reflect evolutionary relationships between species - Traditionally, organisms were classified based on shared physical features - Advancements in technology allowed for DNA sequencing to be used for classification - The more similar the DNA base sequences, the more closely related the species - Living things are classified into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes - Animals are multicellular, lack cell walls and chloroplasts, and obtain nutrition by eating other living things - Plants are multicellular, have cell walls made of cellulose, contain chloroplasts, and obtain nutrition through photosynthesis  [08:09] The five kingdoms of organisms are animal, plant, fungi, protist, and prokaryote - Plant cells have cell walls and chloroplasts - Fungi are usually multicellular, have nuclei, and cell walls not made of cellulose - Protists may have cell walls and chloroplasts, and some make their own food - Prokaryotes are often unicellular, have cell walls not made of cellulose, and no nucleus or mitochondria - Vertebrates and invertebrates are the two major groups within the animal kingdom  [10:51] Vertebrates are animals with a backbone, divided into mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish - Mammals have fur or hair, feed young with milk, have four-chambered hearts, and different types of teeth - Birds have feathers, lay eggs with hard shells, have beaks, and wings instead of four limbs - Reptiles have scaly skin, lay eggs with rubbery shells, and include snakes, crocodiles, and turtles - Amphibians live on both land and water, have moist skin without scales, lay eggs in water, and include frogs and toads", "votes": "21", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "UgwDcelMsGos_dxkdzt4AaABAg", "comment": "You are the bestttt thank you so muchhhh\u2764\u2764\u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "UgyJOLINnqlh_W9v_4B4AaABAg", "comment": "Can we have like a chapter wise mcq and structured questions past paper solving from this channel?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "Ugwnq21W56r9ml21MGx4AaABAg", "comment": "This really saved me, thanksssss \ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "UgxyLhvtZevwSg7Ex3t4AaABAg", "comment": "which notepad or app do you use ??it looks beautiful", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "UgyZgSHh-fH9PT2AkAB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanksss!\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "UgyzSPxxdZXgx8kXob54AaABAg", "comment": "chemical digestion next", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "Ugw_6iaZvgVKd331R_94AaABAg", "comment": "your videos are really helpful thankyou..", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "UgwEp5OOMkh65hPBGmt4AaABAg", "comment": "have an exam in less than 8 hours and your channel is helping me so much....May Allah SWT bless you..", "votes": "58", "replies": "5", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZCsotMAYErk", "cid": "Ugzm9D-UHWvXItWssd54AaABAg", "comment": "Hey there!
