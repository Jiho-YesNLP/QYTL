I then found the number of ways to cross the river given our constraints. I also set a rule for you extra picky people where the frog cannot over jump the river meaning if the river is 7 ft the frog can only jump a total distance of 7 ft he cant take a long leap for no apparent reason and end up at 8 ft. Although he technically crossed the river by taking that long leap and ending up at 8 ft it just causes too many extra cases to arise and from his explanation in the video the frog should not be taking extra leaps just a perfect amount to cross the river. After looking at the ways to cross the river for each case it turns out the pattern was just the Fibonacci sequence again :(  we did all that work to code the same exact thing we just coded a few seconds before. But at least it shows we could apply what the video taught us. I called my function Edfib which means Ed Fibonacci i'm sorry if that offends anyone just know I don't mean it in a way that is making fun of mentally disabled people I just use the word on a regularly basis to mean dumb. Anyways I made the assumption that if the length of the river was 0 (n = 0) there was no river of course and found one small tweak that makes it different from the original Fibonacci sequence. Instead of one base case there are 2 because unlike the original which states that at n = 2 the answer is 1 this is incorrect for the frog leap. At n = 2 there are actually two ways to jump across like stated in the video. This of course could have been bypassed if we let n = 0 return 1 then Edfib at 2 = Edfib at 1 + Edfib at 0 = 1 + 1 = 2 but that just makes no sense how can there be one way to jump across no river. So that sums up my explanation on how I coded the problem and found that if this frog wants to cross this 11 ft river there are 144 ways to do so.

I mean, I can solve problems fine, but what should I do next ? Should I directly start looking into various third-party libraries to learn developing games, websites etc? Or are there some intermediate courses after the basics that I have to take first? So I guess my main question is: Which direction should I go next after I complete the basics of python? Please refer to free courses if possible. Thanks in advance. And I love your videos, they are very clear and enjoyable.
