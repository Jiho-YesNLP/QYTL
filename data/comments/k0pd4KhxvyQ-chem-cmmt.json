You're a bit of a celebrity on the predental subreddit along with other various dental forums. I'm currently studying for the DAT and your videos are perfect to easily understand complex topics. The DAT prep program I'm using is literally linking your videos as well, thats how good you are at this. Thank you for all of these amazing videos.
