Obviously 90% of students must have left the classes before it even started.   Wondering and sleep deprived superfical students would never understand and appreciate the significant difference between the Hz frequency of wave length vs molecular differences although we still have formula to find answer to everthing...  As a slow \ud83d\udc0c  learner and additionally english as a third language while software does everthing for wealthy unreflactive lightholder dude.    Separation of photon would have been great because it's just a part of atom and not molecules..   Mixing way too many nm joule and watt with additional chemicals equation would only confuse and he would have a overreacting 4th grader student like me.  Obviously light matters due to we can see it more than a invisible correlate frequencies or electro magnetic waves without any atoms neither molecular. Although we still have scientific frequencies formula to find the Hz  no wonder we have discrepancy in our radio and satellite decived information to public and authorities.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Ji20_qhjk2Y", "cid": "Ugwg6ArFnjrmFhU0vBF4AaABAg", "comment": "I easily absorbed the 46 Minutes of lecture.
