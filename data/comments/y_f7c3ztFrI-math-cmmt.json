Please tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong. Because as far as I know, you do the brackets first (4-7) which gives you 3. Then you skip exponents & multiplication because there are no exponents & there\u2019s nothing to multiply. So next we do division which is 4/2 which equals 2. Next is addition so we do -3 + 2 which equals -1. And last we do substation so basically 5 -1 which you 6.  So the answer to 5- (4-7)+4/2= 6  But apparently I\u2019m wrong.

It comes down to properties and definitions of operations that are covered in more detail in different videos.   To make a concrete example, consider 6 + 4 * 2. Blindly following PEMDAS, 6 + 8 = 14, which is correct. But more importantly, multiplication is repeated addition. You could just write 4 * 2 as 2 + 2 + 2 +2, the order for 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 is obvious, or rather irrelevant. you can do the those five additions in any order, because of it's cumulative property. Parenthesis are not even operations, simply ways to show stuff like 4 * 2 as something like (1 + 3) * 2 for situations where it makes sense.  If you didn't know pemdas or had the more useful general understanding, you might do 6 + 4, THEN * 2. But notice, that would change the fundamentals of the question. (6 + 4) * (2) is not the same as (6) + (4 * 2), because addition and multiplication can not be rewritten this way while keeping the same end result. The notation we are using in modernity is just that, notation. If we only teach a way to read it \"aloud\", instead of what it actually says, a lot of the use is lost in my opinion.   Another qualm I have with PEMDAS, is that Division is actually just multiplication by the inverse of the number you used for the division. 5/2 is really just 5 * 2^(-1). Subtraction is actually just addition by the negative of the number you used for the addition. 5 - 2 is really just 5 + (-2). There's historical and higher concept reasons for not generalizing like this in every case, but it's not like those are taught in school before you learn of PEMDAS anyway. If you consider only Exponentiation, Multiplication and Addition, the reason for the order is a lot clearer. E is Many M, M is many A, so we go from the top until everything is just addition. When doing algebra it's useful to go the other direction sometimes, and group additions into multiplications to solve more difficult problems, but the point is to preserve the value of the line while computing things, not to stick to an order handed down from on high.   If you were to come up with a different order that is as rigorous as PEMDAS's origins, you would have to redefine/restructure these operations in a way that changes their properties, basically start a completely new math.", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "UgwC0IsL_JouBFIzo254AaABAg.9gcvicyQ_PB9qvIv3Bpg9b", "comment": "12/4+2(1+3)^2-9  First complete the bracket 1+3=4 Then square it 4^2=16 Then times by 2 2x16=32 Then complete the first division 12/4=3 Then go left to right with the resulting equation 3+32-9=26  Took me a while but I figured it out.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "Ugz1ZHQ4btM5Hpt7Vgh4AaABAg.9TzozUwkQOK9TzpEgknEZN", "comment": "the class N1T4", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "UgyTSdRN0O-_IU0VY814AaABAg.9SZ7Z3_JY689T1XuzqKq3t", "comment": "i hope you've found your answer already but it's just another symbol for division, though it can also be a fraction.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "UgyTSdRN0O-_IU0VY814AaABAg.9SZ7Z3_JY689T1_o0tGGBS", "comment": "\u00a0@arzalalbuchari7095\u00a0 Yea ai found out after watching a different video thanks for replying anyway\ud83d\ude09", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "UgyTSdRN0O-_IU0VY814AaABAg.9SZ7Z3_JY689p5XSd30TeB", "comment": "I'm drawing a complete blank on this... i cannot get it", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "Ugzvup8vOUROCjbeEu94AaABAg.9RipkGusRnR9ZGfC_GDmXe", "comment": "How did you get this right?

You can in fact do division and multiplication in any order you like. Then you can do addition and subtraction in any order you like. PEMDAS is a nice help, but is not the whole story.

For you first question: If you take what I said above into account we get 15 + 25 = 40 40 - 54 = -14 -14 + 8 = -6 Another way to look at it is that everything is addition: 15 + 25 + (-54) + 8 = -6 (Dave explains this consept in his video on negative numbers)  For you second question: Why don't I show you how I would do it, and you can compare it to what you tried: 12/4 + 2(1 + 3)^2 - 9 12/4 + 2(4)^2 - 9        -> Parenthesis 12/4 + 2(16) - 9          -> Exponent (also I notice the implied multiplication between 2 and 16 for my next step) 3 + 32 - 9                     -> Multiply and Divide 26                                 -> Add and Subtract  I hope this was more helpfull than confusing!", "votes": "15", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "y_f7c3ztFrI", "cid": "UgxMrIRhsQxRUCJ_K754AaABAg.9Kyj1kODp8h9vuVUCiG1q-", "comment": "If it helpful to think of PEMDAS as: P -> E -> MD -> A?
