[{"vid": "hBlwfG6IBLg", "cid": "UgxqCwo073FthNf3oYl4AaABAg", "comment": "It was a good explanation of the calculations although I wish he would have explained WHY you would want to find the root mean square of a group of values. Root Mean Square (RMS) is a statistical measure used to quantify the average magnitude of a set of values. It involves taking the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squared values, providing a more accurate representation of the overall magnitude while accounting for variations and fluctuations within the dataset. The Root Mean Square (RMS) formula is a mathematical expression used to calculate the square root of the average of the squares of a set of values. It is particularly useful for finding a representative value that reflects the magnitude of a set of data points, while also taking into account both positive and negative values.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hBlwfG6IBLg", "cid": "Ugxt9Vrzc_7khGzldH54AaABAg", "comment": "Why do we take square of the velocities and not modulus?", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hBlwfG6IBLg", "cid": "UgxxnRz--13feg1JKJp4AaABAg", "comment": "Good way to present the concept.... very helpful", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hBlwfG6IBLg", "cid": "Ugz9NcH7cTvTzTNNrPR4AaABAg", "comment": "Sir you are calculating rms of velocity, but you are pronounciating speed.
