I am not sure whether u r gonna answer my question or not. But still, (56:39) u solved Normal Force equals to mg/cos. What makes it different from the other questions that the normal force was usually mg x cos? why makes the normal force to be mg/cos? Also, Thank you for making these videos.

The vertical component is related to the angle theta by Fn*cos(theta).

Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ! Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. ACCORDINGLY, the Moon AND THE PLANETS move AWAY very, very, very slightly in comparison to WHAT IS THE SUN !! SO, carefully consider what is THE EYE !! Finally, think about what is the speed of light (c). E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma (ON BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !  Magnificent. It ALL does CLEARLY make perfect sense ON BALANCE !!! This does explain the fourth dimension, including the term c4 therewith !!! \"Mass\"/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.) Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ! Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. So, notice that what is THE MOON is basically dead or inert ON BALANCE !!! GREAT. INDEED, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE !!! The sky is BLUE, AND what is THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !! (Notice what is THE EYE !!) ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE, AS gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy !!! Great.  Carefully consider what is the Sun. (Very importantly, outer \"space\" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) Consider what is BALANCED observer dependent/related experience ! Carefully consider the man (INCLUDING what is THE EYE) who actually IS in outer \"space\". NOW, think about TIME; AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. INSTANTANEITY is therefore FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience. So, here we have established what can basically and sensibly be understood as constituting a one dimensional relation. A white dwarf star is about the size of the Earth, AND it is ALSO (ON BALANCE) the PROJECTED form or fate (IN TIME) of the Sun !!! Great !!! Stellar clustering ALSO proves (ON BALANCE) that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Against what is outer \"space\", why would the Sun maintain what is its \"preferential\" existence ? The answer is THE EYE/the observer. INDEED, notice that THE EYE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ! Now, ON BALANCE, consider what is the speed of light (c). A galaxy is basically FLAT. SO, think about a TWO dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) as well. HALF of the galaxies are \"dead\" or inert, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma !! Carefully consider what is THE EYE !!  TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Great.  E=MC2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM energy.  Excellent !!! BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand !!!  GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Consider WHAT IS THE MAN who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Think about TIME !!! NOW, the stars AND PLANETS do REMAIN AS what are POINTS in the night sky. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. This explains the cosmological redshift AND the \"black holes\". Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The fact that the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution is not a meaningless coincidence, AS the fact that both the Sun AND the Moon are the SAME SIZE in the sky is not some sort of a meaningless coincidence. Notice the match with the size of what is THE EYE. Magnificent !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE, AS gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Great !!! Carefully consider what are the POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE !!! Think about the necessity (or essential nature) of TIME, AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma ON BALANCE !!! Great. It is proven.  (\"Mass\"/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 IS F=ma.) Consider what is THE SUN AND what is THE EARTH/ground in DIRECT comparison, AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky !!!  GREAT !!! E=MC2 IS F=ma !!!!

While it prevents skidding in these directions, the surface of the wheel and the ground are not sliding pass each other so static friction is active in this instance and not kinetic friction.  In icy / snowy conditions when there's less friction on a road, it's easy for a vehicle traveling north to lose control and skid to the right or to the left.  Once the vehicle begins to skid to the right, the surface of the wheel and the ground are now sliding pass each other.  Kinetic friction takes over and it will be directed toward the left.  Friction is always opposes motion.  In this example, it seems counterintuitive that static friction should be to the left ./ west while the car is moving north.  However, this static friction is not opposing the northbound  motion of the car but it's prevented the tendency of the vehicle to skid to the east while making a circular turn to the west and so static friction is directed west opposite to the eastward skidding motion.
