To eliminate x in eq2 we pair up eq1,eq2  Use the first non-zero value we see in a current operating row (pivot = 1 at (1,1)) to eliminate x and do the rest of the process shown in video.  Then next step is to eliminate y in eq3 and we pair up eq2,eq3 then again finding pivot and repeat the whole process.  Since we don't use eq1 in eliminating y anymore in this step, that's why we don't use 2 at point (1,2) because that is in eq1. Instead we use 2 at point (2,2) because not only that it's in eq2 which we use to eliminate y, it's the pivot (first non-zero value in a current row).  eq1 =   x + 2y + z = 2 eq2 = 3x + 8y + z = 12   -> Step1: remove x from 2nd equation by doing (eq2 - eq1) eq3 =          4y + z = 2    -> Step2: remove y from 3rd equation by doing (eq3 - eq2), finally we get left with \"z\" that we can use for back-substitution to find y and x   Hope this helps.

Most often undergraduate courses will be taught by either the the incompetent, the unskilled, or by poor communicators.  Often all three in combination.    Requiring your best instructors to indoctrinate the freshmen is seen as a waste by many as the drop out rate is high and the lectures are trivial.   Sadly this logic reinforces high drop out and trivial lectures.    My calculus 1 course had a 50% drop out rate and then a 50% failure rate.   The lecturers generally could not speak English, could not teach calculus, and to give them the benefit of a doubt were completely indifferent to the students (as opposed to entirely incompetent).   It  was essentially a farce.   The best strategy was to read the text, do the problems and attend the labs.   The classes were not worth attending.  The Socratic method was generally not seen till late in the 4rth year when it was far to late to salvage most students from rote memorization and pandering to professors idiosyncrasies.   MOOC's have opened up an opportunity for learning that exceeds the abilities of most universities to provide.    Industry has yet to recognize this,  Universities have yet to recognize this, but there are avid students around the world that will begin to generate new science, mathematics, literature without the benefit of an Ivy league education or even a piece of paper recognizing their accomplishments.  There is a massive barrier to publish based on pedigree that has to be overcome and the establishment is highly motivated to maintain these barriers for as long as they can to protect  themselves but it is likely to come down fairly quickly once there is a critical mass of globally educated students producing meaningful outputs.  ... or at least this is my hope.", "votes": "406", "replies": "12", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QVKj3LADCnA", "cid": "Ugjt1yjF6H6DRXgCoAEC", "comment": "It's so irritating that the subtitles are not synced with the audio :/", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QVKj3LADCnA", "cid": "Ugi224_-qsaOGHgCoAEC", "comment": "I like how he explained how a matrix multiplied by a matrix works.

(Demanding to know the legitimacy of this new symbology is nonsensical. \u00a0It's very much equivalent to demanding to know why the utterance 'dog' is used to express the concept of a canine. \u00a0Worse -- it's like trying to derive the significance of the 'og' part of that particulate word.) \u00a0The core things of linear algebra are merely tools -- or better yet: heavy machinery. \u00a0They allow mathematical professionals (of the type you seem to aspire to be) \u00a0to 'move around', or to think in broad terms, about vast quantities of calculations that you have become expert at doing manually. \u00a0As with any scientific concept, their perfection is provisional. \u00a0Rest assured though, that they have been studied extensively for many centuries. \u00a0What they're good for, how they can be worked with, and where they fail are are all reasonably well known (as an example from today: Associative works; Commutative does not.) \u00a0Many people find linear algebra very useful. \u00a0 Now, before this get's out of hand, let me first say that you are absolutely not 'many people.' \u00a0Further, I fully understand that trust and acceptance and taking-the-easy-way-out and group-think all scare the livin'-be-jesus out of ya. So I'm not asking that trust me and study linear because I know that it's right (we've already established that I don't), nor that you go-along-to-get-along, nor that you buckle down and learn this because it's what everyone else is doing. \u00a0What I'm offering here, for your consideration, is that the baubles you'll pick up from mastering linear will likely give you a really nice view of the mathematical world -- and I'm pretty sure you'll like that. \u00a0Have fun!\"", "votes": "6", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QVKj3LADCnA", "cid": "UgjPnHY4XB2LiXgCoAEC", "comment": "When I was young I studied these topics at high school and again at the first year of the degree in physics 16 years ago.

If a student is unable to ask a question, they will cap at what is statically given to them.    They must then turn to other resources, of which they may not find an answer or a \"good\" answer to their question.  For example, if they asked the question on an online forum or even watch another video on the topic, they may not get a suitable answer because it is not a \"interactive\" one.  MOOC's are like having a one-way conversation; you only discover half of what is there.
