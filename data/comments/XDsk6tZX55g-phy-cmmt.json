All the orchestral woodwind instruments apart from the clarinet overblow at the octave. That's because they're going from the fundamental frequency (the 1st harmonic) up to the next harmonic.

If it has every harmonic possible, it's a saw wave, and if it has alternating harmonics, it's a square wave.   There's also more than just the attributes of the standing wave that play into it, The other half, is the way that energy is added to the wave, For instance the difference between a plucked string instrument, and a bowed string instrument. a Plucked string instrument when played softly is a sine wave, when plucked with a pick becomes a triangle wave, and when plucked very hard becomes a saturated sine wave (gaining alternating harmonics and becoming square-like, but not getting all the harmonics), and then loses harmonics over time.  This is because energy is only added in one moment.   A bowed instrument on the other hand, Dramatically shapes the wave into a Saw-wave, containing all the harmonics. It does so by the bow gripping the string at one point, pulling it all the way to a peak, and then letting go, only to instantly pull it back into a peak again faster than it's normal oscillation allows. This means the peaks are equidistant from eachother, and the troughs are equidistant from eachother, BUT the peaks distance from the trough is skewed, where one trough is closer to a particular peak than another. Brass instruments also work this way, the inside of the mouth builds pressure, then releases it in a burst only to abruptly stop and build more pressure, but the pressure is only added at the peak and not the trough of the wave.   Then there's woodwinds, which are based on square waves. One end being closed does play into that square shape, of alternating harmonics, BUT the way in which energy is added to the wave is ALSO square in nature. In woodwind instruments there is a wooden plate, called a reed, which the air must flow over. air blows into the instrument and pushes the reed into one of two possible positions, it allows a small amount of air through and then the reed seals off the air from that direction, and now air must go the other way, which then flips the reed into the other position, and it alternates between two fixed positions. This is a square wave. adding energy to the wave ONLY at the maximum points of the peak and trough of the wave. This is also how kazoos work.   These principals for harmonic content where deliberately chosen to create different characteristics for instruments, and now in modern day, (especially in the 70's and 80's when it was new) electronic instruments attempting to emulate the sounds of real instruments, used basic waveforms, Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, and Pulse, though at this point it's less about physics and more about maths.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "XDsk6tZX55g", "cid": "UghRoeMAG-qRUngCoAEC", "comment": "The relationship between note frequencies in the 12-seminote scale is magical.

Third harmonic is the 5th of the original note one octave higher (e.g. if original note was C, the third harmonic is going to be a G). Fourth harmonic is again the original note but this time 2 octaves higher. Fifth harmonic brins a new note, the 3rd of the original (e.g. form C to E). Sixth harmonic is again the 5th of the original but two octaves higher than the original note. Seventh harmonic brings a new note again, this time the minor 3rd of the original. Eighth harmonic?
