To answer this question one must know the role of surface charges in establishing a current and potential difference in a circuit.   Supposing there is a simple series circuit comprising a battery, wires and a resistor R1 and there is a dead-end branch with a resistor R2 across R1. When the circuit is made then initially electrons flow into both branches, but the surface of the dead-end branch becomes charged so negatively that no more electrons can enter. This prevents current flowing into the dead-end branch. Current of appropriate strength will flow in the R2 branch when the branch is connected across R1.   It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the rearrangement of surface charges which allows current through the branch.   Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two and it is instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos:   i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss surface charges and explains their rearrangement with the help of sequential diagrams in parallel circuits and topics on capacitive and inductive circuits using a unified approach to electrostatics and circuits.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "2Zu3ppq3n8I", "cid": "UgzmmpQnO5OBnexBpYt4AaABAg", "comment": "Can we all agree organic chem tutor is the best help for nearly any class on youtube.

The voltage actually comes from the positive (+) sign and not the negative (-) since the negative side is just like the ground, has a zero voltage. And the current flows from low potential to high potential, aka the ground (zero) which is the negative side to the high potential (24V) which is the positive side. It doesn't matter in solving these problems but I think it matters if you really want to understand how these things work, although most schools would just use the convention (+) to (-) which is contradictory to the low-to-high potential thing.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "2Zu3ppq3n8I", "cid": "UgxwmEbwsRTgr2sLGZ14AaABAg", "comment": "college is just an overpriced syllabus this mans actually teaches", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "2Zu3ppq3n8I", "cid": "UgzaR5zbuqF67tcb5QZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Are you a real person?

Since the electron is the charge carrier in most man-made circuits.  However, this isn't universally the case.  Circuits do exist where positive sodium ions are the charge carriers, like in human nerve cells.  You might also have a circuit with antimatter, or other exotic particles, where the charge carriers are positive.   Unlikely, but it could happen.  Benjamin Franklin's \"mistake\" that caused him to unwittingly assign the electron as negative before it was discovered, tells us to be flexible, and know that charges flow opposite the conventional current if the charges are negative.
