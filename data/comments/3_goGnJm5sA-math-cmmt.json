When 4ac-b^2 = 0, the second square disappears, and you're left with w = a(x+by/2a)^2. You do indeed have both the x and y terms, so you can still pick any arbitrary x and y and come up with unique values.  However, there EXISTS a direction in the x-y plane in which the value of w does not change. You can pretty easily see this if you just look at the inner x and y terms, (x + ky), where k = b/2a. If you set x + ky = h, where h represents a fixed (i.e., non-changing) value of the function w, then you can always find a line of degeneracy in the form of y = (h - x)/k. The important point is that, by following this line, (x+ky) never changes, and therefore neither does a(x+ky)^2 = w.  Using your example, W = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, we can look at it in the sum of squares form, W = (x+y)^2. It has no second square because 4ac-b^2 = 0. You can set (x+y) = h, and get that y = h-x. So for instance, if you wanted to go off into infinity and hang out at the value of W = 0 forever, you can do that by following the line y = -x. If you instead prefer the value W = 4, you can set x+y = 2 and follow the line y=2-x.  When 4ac-b^2 is NOT 0, and you have something like W = (x+y)^2 + cy^2, you can still find a line in which the first term does not change, however the second term will \"screw it up\" along the line and change the value of W.

Looking only at the quadratic function in the square bracket (which is just w/y^2) and using the standard mechanisms for quadratic functions, note that:  (1) if the discriminant b^2 - 4ac < 0 there are no real-valued roots, meaning that the function w/y^2 is either negative everywhere or positive everywhere (it never crosses the (x/y) axis). Since w is just that function multiplied by a non-negative factor y^2, the surface of w will never cross the xy plane. Consequently, since the critical point is at the origin, it must be a maximum or a minimum (depending on the sign of a).  (2) if b^2 - 4ac > 0, there are two real roots and w/y^2 crosses the x/y axis. So w/y^2 has both positive and negative values, which means w (which is the same function scaled by a non-negative value y^2) also crosses the xy plane and has both positive and negative values. Since the sole critical point of w is at the origin, it must be a saddle point (in some directions the function will drop below the xy plane and in other directions it will rise above).  So the discriminant b^2-4ac for the quadratic function has corresponding meanings with the 4ac-b^2 discriminant found for the quadratic form (one just swaps the < and > signs since one is the negated version of the other).  Incidentally, one can put into context the quadratic function w/y^2 (for the given a, b and c) by realising that its range is just the set of heights of the surface w relative to the circumference of a circle segment found by rotating the unit vector ai (for any nonzero a) in the xy plane at angles 0 < theta < pi (pi < theta < 2pi is just a reflection), all divided by y^2.  In other words, the range of a(x/y)^2 + b(x/y) + c is w(a, theta)/y^2 (in polar coordinates) for all 0 < theta < pi and any nonzero a. The corresponding rectangular coordinates yield the ratio values in the domain of w(x,y)/y^2. Since the x/y ratio is a function of direction from the origin and not distance, w(a, theta)/y^2 is invariant to (nonzero) values of a.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "3_goGnJm5sA", "cid": "Ugg3_eIkrp8_HngCoAEC.8B6PP1M3tqW8POeSZFN60c", "comment": "Thank you very much for your answer sir.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "3_goGnJm5sA", "cid": "UgiXWyEzbLXCz3gCoAEC.8B2okDILFRS8BwVNznkCPJ", "comment": "+Daniela Santos it's about the timing of the professor.

First you have to go back to the mind of a 20 year old. Everything is amusing, even a contest race of a professor's eraser skills vs. auto-board drop down. Second,\u00a0Denis Auroux is not just any professor, he's immensely popular with MIT students. This popularity includes not just one, but two fan clubs. The students lucky enough to attend his lectures actually understand that it is indeed a privilege to be there. If you follow through his lectures beginning to end, he's quite famous for taking partially understood concepts, mixing new material into a craftily tied together composite lecture, and by the end, you've learned something new in multiple dimensions.
