In the equation Ax=0, every entry of the vector x is telling you how many of each column of A you need to take (or by what scalar to multiply them), to then add them together and get the 0 vector. If A is a 2x2 matrix, and x is a vector with entries x1 and x2, then you need x1 times the first column of A + x2 times the second column of A. What this is really is asking, is what linear combination of columns 1 and 2 will give the 0 vector. And if there exists a vector x that will satisfy this equation, that also neccesarily means that those column vectors must be linearly dependent - that's how linear dependence is defined.
