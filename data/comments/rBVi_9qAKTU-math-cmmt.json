At my university, a Physics B.S. required a minor in math. So, many advisors would push Physics students into dual majoring in Math and Physics. The problem was not everyone was good at proofs. I was one of them. It was a painful experience going from straight A's in Calculus and my applied math courses to struggling to get B's in my proof-intensive courses. Our Math department had a sink/swim mentality toward students at the time.  They only started requiring and offering a course on mathematical proofs when they wanted to hop on the actuarial science bandwagon. My exposure to more abstract math has helped me understand the finer points of using math in physics and engineering work. However, I still struggle with rigorous mathematical treatments. So,  I really have a love-hate relationship with math.    I really should have taken a history of mathematics course in my department.  There is a slight disjoint between how things in math and science are developed and are taught.  I think Special Relativity is an excellent example.  Everyone gets hung up on the speed of light because many books talk about the Michelson-Morely experiment.  Einstein was aware of their results, but he was more inspired by Faraday's Laws of Induction.  Basically, Einstein assumed Maxwell's Theory of Electromagnetism was more fundamental than Newton's Mechanics, then determined how that affected relativity.

Only if we plot the derivative as a second equation on the same graph, then we would say that y=2 for the second equation.  But it is an unrelated y from the first equation.  What you are finding is the slope of the tangent line.  It is a trivial case for a linear equation, because the tangent line is the original equation, so it isn't an interesting example.  Continuing on with your second example, of y=x^2, consider the point when x=3.   We calculate the equation of a line in the form of y=m*x+b, that will intersect our original equation (y=x^2) at the point x=3.   We take the derivative to determine the value of m, and get m=6.  We then set y=9 (the original value of x^2 at x=3), and x=3, and solve for b.  We get b= -9.   We now can construct the equation of the tangent line which is y = 6*x - 9.  Graph the equations on the same plot, and study what happens near the point where x=3 and y=9: y = x^2 y = 6*x - 9  Observe how the tangent line intersects at this point, but doesn't intersect at a second point in the immediate vicinity.  The tangent line has a slope that locally matches the slope of the curved graph.   That is what the derivative is.  We are calcualting the value of m, in y=m*x+b, such that the line locally resembles the original curve at the point of tangency.

Yes, it does mean finding a slope of a slope to some extent.  It is approximately a way to measure how concave or curved a function's graph is at a given point.  \"Why would you want or need to find an area 3 times?\"  An application of triple integrals is summing up the mass of a region of space that is not uniform.  Perhaps you have an object that is made of some kind of resin filled with iron powder, whose density is not uniform, and you'd like to calculate the total density.  Possibly you also want to determine dynamics properties like moment of inertia and center of mass.  Your CAD programs do triple integrals to determine mass, moment of inertia, and center of mass, which you would be interested in knowing for a manufactured part that is part of a machine.  \"And where's the proof that these \"rules\" actually work?? I've never seen any of that in any lesson. Teachers sure as hell don't explain it. \"  Probably because knowing how to do the proof is either beyond the scope of the course, or not the main purpose of teaching it to you.   The proofs are well-documented and easy to look-up if you care to learn.  You can look up \"proof of the power rule for any real exponent\", or \"proof of the product rule\" and find a limit proof of it.  This is the kind of work that is best left to you to read in the textbook, while teaching you how to apply the rules is the main focus of the class.  \"Did whoever invented this crap say to the other, eh, yeah that looks good, we'll call that right. \" No, there are formal proofs of everything mathematicians contribute to our body of knowledge.  They had a burden of proof to convince their contemporary peers that their ideas work.  \"And now we're supposed to believe shuffling around parentheses and letters and getting an \"answer\" of parentheses and letters is somehow a useful skill?\" Because it enables you to generalize a mathematical problem that may apply to the real world, so that you have a closed-form solution that could apply to any specifications you give it.  A reason why this is so important: when programmers develop software that will do hundreds if not thousands of calculations for every input you give it, they need to know a generalized solution to problems, so it isn't using computationally intensive \"solver\" methods every time.  It's much more efficient to compute a quadratic formula for instance, than it is use trial and error to narrow down the solutions by guessing what they are and refining them.

They often do try to avoid giving you too much tedious arithmetic with the given numbers, so that you can solve it without a calculator.  If you feel you've got questions with it, I'm willing to assist.  It's not necessarily some fictitious game, although video games are a common application of the science you learn in Physics and Calculus.  That way the movements can look realistic and match a player's instincts from the real world.  It also is used in designing machinery, buildings, roads, bridges, electric circuits, and all sorts of innovations we've had since the industrial revolution...and even before then.  The examples you see in a textbook may seem like too simplistic of a case to have value in the real world, and be nowhere near what people who use Calculus professionally might do.  But the reason you get such examples is to come up with an application of the concepts you can easily relate to, minimize the complexity of multiple concepts coexisting in the same problem, and use as a building block to understand how to put together dozens of concepts from all over science, to eventually learn to solve problems professionally.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "rBVi_9qAKTU", "cid": "UgyR-2aPthe9bT7Jc5p4AaABAg.9TG6SD8DuhN9bL8v4Pi7hC", "comment": "\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 ...I will say as much head scratching as I do looking at calc problems, I'll take it any day over analyzing literature.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "rBVi_9qAKTU", "cid": "Ugw2PpoBYsz8-R3uCdV4AaABAg.9T3lMqAqGIG9T3q6aWeOPH", "comment": "This is not a tutorial on the history of mathematics.

I think the book was held by the Romans after they defeated the Greeks before Christ. Then, in the 800s, a priest erased the text from the papirus and wrote over religious text. Around 1900, someone discovered that there were marks or impression in the background of the pages. However, the technology to reproduce the erased text was not available at the time.  In 1993, a millionaire purchased the book for more than 3 million dollars and donated it to a museum for examination. Well, the latest technology allowed to recover most of the writting made by Archimedes and what I learned about the content gave me goosebumps. Archimedes had developed the infinite calculus theory more than 200 years before Christ. Then the world had to wait more than 1500 years for Issak Newton to reinvent the wheel. Infinite calculus is the basis of engineering and progress.

Wolfram Alpha can appeal to complex numbers as an intermediate step, when part of your equation has no real solution.  Inventing new kinds of math is a process that has been happening for thousands of years, as we develop a bigger and bigger picture of what a number even is, and what we can do with it.   Whether math is invented or discovered is a deep philosophical question.  Some see it as a concept that always exists, and people just need to discover it and find a language to describe it.   Others see it as mathematicians invent the solution to solve the problem, just like an engineer inventing a new product.

I did homework of 30 complex problems in the half hour before class while classmates were struggling with the last problems in the book (usually the hardest).  It was so easy I had time to draw caricatures and pictures between the problems, much to my profs amusement.  (I was premed and artist).  But I never really understood what the point of calculus.  I wound up thinking, Who cares what's under a curve?  Curves were trends - up, down, flat - predicting results.  I just couldn't see why you'd want to calculate the 'result' for every possibility.  I mean if you want to know how hot it was in Arizona on such and such date ... heck.... just follow the line up to the function and get it.  No rectangles needed for an infinitely thin line.   How useful was EVERY temperature of EVERY day at the same time going to be?  This thinking led to struggling when my calculus met physics.  Physics was also easy for me .... except when it met calculus .... because again, I saw no point to ruining physics to get a curve nobody cared about since what we wanted was real values.   Where was the cannonball at t=10, known weight, angle and force?  Who cared about the rest of the trip?  And why did we need area under a curve when the axes had most of the relevant information and the function line had the trend?  These are the questions students ask but can't put words to them.  In fact when a student asked, \"What is the point of this?\" the beginning calculus instructor went ballistic about how if they didn't want to be in college, why were they wasting chair space?  He missed the point of the question entirely!  None of us dared pursue that line of inquiry, whether we understood or not.  This is  the guy grading our papers!

When you need to solve the same integral hundreds, if not thousands of times within a computer program, it helps to have the programmer implement the analytic solution first, rather than using Riemann sums for everything.  Even if you only need the accuracy of a Riemann sum, there still is value in having a closed-form analytic solution.  The closed-form analytic solution also allows us to explore what would happen if we vary the parameters of the problem and understand it in generalized sense, while a Riemann sum is a dead-end to only one solution of one integral.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "rBVi_9qAKTU", "cid": "Ugy09bxqPhoH12MT8gF4AaABAg.8w8Fzpfr_MO8w9731eKGsP", "comment": "In science we seek to know for the sake of knowing.

Basically, 300 years before common era, Europe was doing mathematics to the degree of nearly acquiring the skill of Calculus, then for near 1900 years after, in the 1600 c.e, suddenly picked up from where they left off.  Is this correct?  In fact, according to traditional telling, Archimedes was right in the middle of this calculation when he was interrupted by a Roman general, and then after that, the Romans pretty much ran the show and didn't do any math!?!  Let me correct some details: Archimedes would not have known what the hell a Greek is, since there was no such people.  The title for Mediterraneans came to be Hellenes during the Byzantine Empire, and later re-rendered as Greek by the Latins use of the word \"Grace.\"  What ethnicity he would have assigned himself Proto-Greeks?  Who knows.  That said, I noticed that you did not indicate Madhava when talking about Calculus, but for sure, as Leibniz's approximation for Pi seems a direct rip of Madhava's techniques, so at the very least, these gentlemen would have to had been SOMEWHAT influenced by works and people who as much deserve credit for Calculus as any, but whatever.  To be clear, you are not getting to Calculus without 0, an Indian offering, or negative values, a Chinese offering, or Algebra an Arabic/Persian/African offering, or fractions, and \"Egyptian\" (That word is Roman as well and does not refer to the people in true historic fashion) as simply approximating by exhaustion only indicates Calculus, but can not be used to prove the definition of a derivative.

But to be clear, the way the definition of a derivative is stated today, especially because it references \"limits,\" wouldn't wholly go to Newton, since the functional notation is Euler and limits require a host of different people to be properly credited.  No one ever says Fermat invented \"limits\" since that would be impolite.  His work on optimizations were common to both he and his contemporaries.  So, as my students are inclined to ask, \"who came up with 'that?'  And who came up with the thing they needed to come up with 'that.'\"  So you can see what I am saying as being \"self-righteous\" if you like.

He foresaw that a force of somekind, likely originating from the sun, must be making it all happen.  As a contemporary of Galileo, he was a proponent of heliocentrism.   Galileo provided observational proof of heliocentrism, suggested by a student of his, that Venus would go through a full set of phases.  Galileo also laid the groundwork for Newton, such as confirming mass independence of free fall, determining that an object's default state of motion is a constant velocity, and coming up with the concept of relative motion analysis and reference frames.  Newton picked up, where Galileo and Kepler left off.  He determined the complete foundation for mechanics in general, and the branch of mathematics of Calculus to put it all together.  His goal was to provide a holistic explanation of Kepler's laws, from first principles, which motivated him to discover Calculus.

To me this makes more sense than having them memorize things like the axis of symmetry for a quadratic equation is -b/2a, as many text require.   In Algebra II the chain rule could be introduced as well as the product and quotient rules.  In Trigonometry it wouldn't take much time to teach (without proof) the derivatives of sine, cosine, tan, cot, sec, and csc.

So basically no calculus is not an extension of arithmetic like algebra is. A lot of calculus can be done with real inputs and outputs and only algebraic functions, but you can have multivariate inputs (each of which has a number as an output) and vector input and output functions. When you\u2019re doing the work in calculus a lot of time you deal with transcendental functions which don\u2019t have polynomial solutions (examples are trig and exponential functions). So no it\u2019s not a further abstraction of arithmetic like high school algebra tends to be. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s ridiculously hard, I think it\u2019s just hard for a lot of people to grasp concepts that deal with infinity in a real way for the first time in their learning career.

Also people assume that anyone one person can just go and come up with something so radically different, generally those people are over estimating how things work, radically different hasn't been proven, that is like saying that some guy can jump 1000 feet or saying that some guy can read 1 million books in a day.
