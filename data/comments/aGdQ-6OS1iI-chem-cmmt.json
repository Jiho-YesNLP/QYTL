Whichever one has the smaller about of concentration, that will be your product. Le chatelier's principle explains why. If you have more of the same thing on one side of the equation, the reaction will push towards the other side to equalize the two. Therefore, the cell in which you have more is the reactants. The cell in which you have less is the products side.
