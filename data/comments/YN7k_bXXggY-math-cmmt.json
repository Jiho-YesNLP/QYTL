Something to this effect would be offered regardless of which university you go to, prestigious or otherwise.

When I did this course in my undergrad uni almost a decade ago, there was a lot more proving of theorems and a lot less calculus techniques were discussed. The professors just gave us basic limit theories and we were assessed on our ability to do do the proofs and derivations of the actual actual calculus techniques and tiny bit in our ability to use these techniques. But then again, that course had a bad rep from non-maths students of what they learn not being so useful and from what I heard, was changed soon after. Most people who take these course are not mathematicians. They are economists and physicists and engineers etc. For them, application and learning when to when when not to use these techniques are more important than how these techniques work.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "YN7k_bXXggY", "cid": "UgildMu-qVCAD3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-HoPC7546CG3A0MQ", "comment": "Nahid Akbar\u00a01. The reason this course is rigorous is because it covers calc 1 and 2 in one semester not a year like almost every other university does.\u00a0 2.
