I would like to ask you the most important question ever asked: \r \r  Who is  Jesus? Not who is He to you. Rather, who is He really?\r \r \r Jesus is the Son of God, who came to the world as a man. He lived a perfect and sinless life . Even though He was perfect and sinless, on the cross of Calvary God wrathfully punished Him for the sins of the world. 3 days later He rose from death. Now He is seated at the right hand of God, ruling as King over Heaven and Earth.\r On the judgment day He will judge you, me and every human being that has ever lived. Those who believed in Him will enter eternal joy with Him, but those who did not believe in Jesus will be sent to eternal condemnation. \r \r \r So turn from your sins and believe in the Jesus. Believe and hope that you can be forgiven for all your sins because of His death and resurrection. He took your place in Hell, so that if you submit to Him as your Lord and God, you can be forgiven and take His place in heaven- you will be made sinless and perfect before the Holy Father. He'll also give you a new heart and mind that can love and obey Him. \r \r \r Jesus lives so that you can have true life and freedom, and most importantly so that you can have an eternally peaceful relationship with God.\r \r You are dead, and Jesus is your only Hope of life by reading The Bible. Start in Matthew, and try and read it through to The book of Revelation. Spend at least 15 minutes in a private place to read it. Read the Bible over and over again. The Creator of The universe, nature and all creation, has made Himself more clearly known through The Bible, as it is the only perfect, unchanging and authoritative revelation of God.

I would like to ask you the most important question ever asked: \r \r  Who is  Jesus? Not who is He to you. Rather, who is He really?\r \r \r Jesus is the Son of God, who came to the world as a man. He lived a perfect and sinless life . Even though He was perfect and sinless, on the cross of Calvary God wrathfully punished Him for the sins of the world. 3 days later He rose from death. Now He is seated at the right hand of God, ruling as King over Heaven and Earth.\r On the judgment day He will judge you, me and every human being that has ever lived. Those who believed in Him will enter eternal joy with Him, but those who did not believe in Jesus will be sent to eternal condemnation. \r \r \r So turn from your sins and believe in the Jesus. Believe and hope that you can be forgiven for all your sins because of His death and resurrection. He took your place in Hell, so that if you submit to Him as your Lord and God, you can be forgiven and take His place in heaven- you will be made sinless and perfect before the Holy Father. He'll also give you a new heart and mind that can love and obey Him. \r \r \r Jesus lives so that you can have true life and freedom, and most importantly so that you can have an eternally peaceful relationship with God.\r \r You are dead, and Jesus is your only Hope of life by reading The Bible. Start in Matthew, and try and read it through to The book of Revelation. Spend at least 15 minutes in a private place to read it. Read the Bible over and over again. The Creator of The universe, nature and all creation, has made Himself more clearly known through The Bible, as it is the only perfect, unchanging and authoritative revelation of God. You know there is an Almighty and Glorious God when you look at the universe and nature, but you can only know who He is by reading the Bible.\r \r \r Bible link for YOU: https://my.bible.com/bible/111/MAT.1.NIV \r \r Acts 15:11\r \u201dOn the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.\"\r Ephesians 1:7\r \u201dIn Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace\"\r Ephesians 2:8\r \u201dFor it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,\u201d\r John 11:25-26: \"Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?'\r 1 Corinthians 6:14: \"And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.\"\r Romans 6:9: \"We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.\"\r \r https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Christ-Is-Lord\r Source: https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Christ-Overcoming\r \r Revelations 19:16\r \"And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, \u201cKING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.\u201d\r \r \r Acts 10:36\r \r \"The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)\"\r John 16:33\r \"I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me.

YouTube merch is mostly terrible at selling I'll admit. Only the big boys with over 10 mill subs are able to dominate merch sale.  Many other YouTubers with as many subs as you suffer similarly.  But once you grow, you'll sell it for sure.  I'm broke, so sorry I can't support you though.  But thank you for your videos.
