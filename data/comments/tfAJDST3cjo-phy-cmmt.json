It means that there will not be a sliding motion along the surface, since the latter requires that the scalar component of the downward normal force be negative. In other words, if you pull a 12 kg box with a force of 350 N at 30 degree angle, the box will take off the surface.

Force, as we know it, turns out to be nothing more than an expression to express an idea like one would use the word \"Love\" to express once feelings.  Force or Net Force is not the initial cause of motion.  Energy (applied energy) is the origin of motion and not Force.  Example:  Choose an object of your choices and without applying the energy from within you, try to push and pull by applying \"only\" the Force or Net Force.  Meaning that Energy (applied energy) is the origin of motion and not \"Force\".  Once Energy (E) is applied, it creates what is known as Momentum (p).  When this Momentum (p), which is mass and velocity, comes in contact with an object(s), it makes a surface contact that will enable you to push and pull.  Energy (E) and Momentum (p) or \"Ep\", are not to be confused with Kinetic Energy in any way.  Without Energy, there is no Momentum.  Without Momentum, there is no surface contact on an object(s) to push, pull, work, shaping objects, motion, gravity, magnetism, radiation, etc.  Momentum does not and cannot exist without the applied Energy that creates it.  Energy and Momentum or \"Ep\", is the only common denominator that links all fundamental forces of nature.  Without Ep, all fundamental forces of nature would be inert or non-existence.   ~Guadalupe Guerra", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "tfAJDST3cjo", "cid": "UgzlPC4XXJNetEKhQTB4AaABAg.9EjyJOLbT1M9HMM89Wxh41", "comment": "It\u2019s not that hard.

You are right if you're only talking about the picture he drew, in that some force would have to hold the box to the surface for it to keep traveling only horizontally (rather then a \"negative upwards force\" It's probably easier to call it as a positive downwards force, eg gravity, similar to how friction is a positive backwards force, not a \"negative forwards force\" [even though mathematically they are the same thing of course]).  Notice though that the actual question includes no mention of a surface, or definition of the frictional force as a RESULT of drag on a surface. Therefor, for the purposes of solving the question, the box is floating in liquid, air, or space and the frictional force will be continuously working on the box from all sides, not just from a surface. So in respect to the net horizontal force, in the video is absolutely correct.  You're also right however that the acceleration and final speed are incorrect unless we assume that there is some force (eg gravity) that is stopping the box from moving upwards. Otherwise the acceleration and traveling would happen diagonally; the frictional force would be the same (assumed from the word \"constant\" and no mention of it only being horizontal horizontal) but we'd need to calculate with the original 350 N.
