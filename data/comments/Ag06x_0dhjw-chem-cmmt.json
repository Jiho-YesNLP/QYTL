Could not have thought of a better way to explain such a concept in 10 minutes while providing the laws in their most pure and general form.  I came here while misunderstanding the concept of Osmotic pressure that arose in an exercise in cellular neurophysiology, but have gained the intuition of diffusion which was so lacking for me.

But it occurred to me that there is something else that I still don\u2019t understand about this entropy concept and the second law of thermodinamics. It seems to me that it doesn\u2019t consider the possibility of natural atraction of molecules, for example. Look at the galaxies that, because of gravity, concentrated mass that might be spread out in a bigger amount of space, like a low density gas cloud. Or, let\u2019s suppose, in your final example, that the five molecules (blue, brown, red, black and pink) could form gradually and naturally a more complex and structured molecule. Would that violate the second law of thermodinamics?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Ag06x_0dhjw", "cid": "UghRPwIabynTbHgCoAEC", "comment": "AWESOME LECTURE,SIMPLE EXPLANATION BUT MORE GAIN.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Ag06x_0dhjw", "cid": "UghPixlZJIuxnXgCoAEC", "comment": "This bro lifts weights and books, thank you for the videos!
