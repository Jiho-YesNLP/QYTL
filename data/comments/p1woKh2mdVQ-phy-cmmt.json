The production value is great. However:  At 05:00 you say that there is an isothermal process where heat is slowly added, but the animation shows lots of heat (Q_H) escaping. What gives?  At 05:04 You say that the isothermal expansion is 1/2 AB. Shouldn't it be the entire path AB?   At 05:15 you say \"the temperature drops whilst the heat stays constant, which also makes the volume expand\". Well this is misleading: a temperature drop would cause an isolated system volume to contract. However in a Carnot engine, the system is doing work on the atmosphere, converting internal energy into work, and dropping the temperature. It's best to say that the expansion work drops the temperature, not that a colder temperature causes an expansion.  Also, when you keep saying \"the heat stays constant\", shouldn't you be saying \"there is no heat flow\" or something equivalent?  At 05:40 you say \"the heat doesn't change\" but perhaps you should be saying that there is no heat flow, or the system is thermally insulated, or something else equivalent.

All of the ideal thermodynamic processes are assumed to be reversible, as you say. But that's just down to the definition, since reversibility requires that no entropy is produced. I didn't think about that, and gave you a bad example. I'm sorry.  If we move away from the ideal, however, isothermal and adiabatic processes are the closest thing we have to reversible processes, because they either don't change the temperature, or they don't exchange heat. you can even adjust the heat exchange in an isothermal process to match the entropy production, but that just means you put less heat into the system, while removing the same amount of heat you did before, giving you less work. In reality, friction and other factors will make sure that no process is truly reversible.   If you want the mathematical reason why the carnot cycle is considered the ideal, it can be made fairly clear using as T-s diagram.  All cycles have a state with maximum temperature, and maximum entropy. Same goes for their minimums. Draw vertical lines to mark out the maximum and minimum entropy levels. Then draw horizontal lines to mark the maximum and minimum temperature values. These lines should now intersect to form a rectangle, that shows the restrictions of the system. They also represent the Carnot cycle of the system. Trying to find a more efficient cycle for that system would be equivalent to trying to draw a loop within the rectangle, that enclosed a bigger area than the rectangle.  The horizontal lines of the rectangle make up isothermal processes, while the vertical ones are isentropic (aka ideal adiabatic).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "p1woKh2mdVQ", "cid": "UghikKQws-UCw3gCoAEC.8J8loiDsofV8JCifNhLBSw", "comment": "Voil\u00e0 !!
