Cancer (Neoplasia or Proliferation Disease State) is a Pathologic Growth of Tissue (Neural, Muscle, Epithelial, or Connective Tissue): 1) Dysregulation and Degeneration of Normal Tissue Growth (Normoplasia or Euplasia); 2) Genetic Molecular Mechanism of Gene variation or Pathologic Changes within the Genome; a) Oncogene (Proto-Oncogene Transformation) is a Pathologic Growth Signaling Gene expression, usually a Transcription Factor of Growth; b) Proto-Oncogene is Beneficial and when Normal promotes Cell Survival (Growth and Proliferation); c) Loss of Regulated Proto-oncogenic Function (CDKs, E2F, Wnt, MYC Gene Variation et al) is a Possible Mechanism of Neoplasia, also known as a Gain of Function (GOF) mutation (Accelerated growth or Loss of breaks analogy); d) Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs) are marked by a Loss of Function Variation of a Gene (Mutation otherwise), usually a TF (p53, BRCA1,2 etcetera); e)  TSGs are known also for Regulatory Function of Cell Repair (DNA Repairing) and integrity of a Cell.  Caretaker or Custodians of the Genome are other epithets, f) Growth Signals (Growth Factors [GFs]) regulate Gene expression of Cyclins (G1 Cyclin Specifically to G1-S Cyclin [Commitment to Cell Cycle Signal]) and Other Cytokines (Il-6, TNFs) can be Signal of START; g)  E2F (TF) where RB Protein Bind to such represses (mRNA biosynthesis of E2F) where the Phosphorylation of RB (Retinoblastoma Gene; First Cloned Gene) deactivates Such and E2F is capable to Bind the Promoter Region of DNA Molecule (Biosynthesis of mRNA or Transcription will ensue);  h) RB Gene Variation (Mutation) can have Neoplastic Growth Processes leading to Neoplasm therein: 1) In Sporadic Variation, there is no History or Diathesis of Neoplasia specifically within the Retina and usually manifests unilaterally (affecting only one Eye); b) 2) Familial RB (Diathesis) is an Inherited and pathologic Variation of RB Gene (Bilaterally manifestation) and implies predisposition to this Proliferation Disease.

They exhibit the characteristics of an organ. They have a basement membrane, a micro environment with a lot of other cells as found in any other organ in the body. These cells are connective tissue cells, which do all the supportive work for the specialized cells, in the case of cancer, this is the cancer cells. Anything between about 5% to as much as 85% of the cells in the tumor are connective tissue cells!  Added to that the tumor forms a blood network / supply, a lymphatic supply and in many cases hey, a nerve supply, a network of nerves. AND they have stem cells, yeah cancer stem cells that have all the markers of embryonic stem cells. Yamanaka eat your heart out!. The cancer stem cells give rise to all the other cancer cells, if not all the other cells in the tumor. Come on, does this sound like evolution? If so then it is fish to man in a cool thousand years.

IMO from my own observations, cancer is stem cell mediated immunity, erroneously ignited in the body owing to false beliefs about a possible danger or possible harm. The body moves to try and build some barrier. It is a bad move because the danger is only hateful suggestions of someone wanting to do the person harm.

I am in the process of writing about cancer and to the best that I can understand the biology in scientific terms. All I can say now is that it is stem cell mediated immunity, but erroneously ignited in the body owning to false beliefs.    In other words it is a nocebo effect, a person's physiological reaction to ideas of possible harm. If you read the science  you will find that very far from DNA and genetic damage or errors, it is cancer stem cells that give rise to all the other cancer cells and maybe all the other cells in the tumor because a lot are normal connective tissue cells.   It was way back in the late 1990s when the first cancer stem cell was found. They don't create cancer in the lab. They create transformed cells but they are not cancer.

You really believe that the body can make a decision or is capable of independent intelligent thought? Neither one. The conscious being makes the decision /has the thought AND that thought / decision causes the conscious being to react in some way. That reaction is physiological. SO if the person has bought into the false belief of possible danger or possible harm, their body will move to try and wall off or somehow deal with the situation. Thus the body creates a novel organ in the area where the possible harm is believed to be. This is none other than a nocebo effect.  Consider the doctors tell patients that the chemotherapy or the radiation they are being given for treatment can cause cancer. This makes the treatments possible harm. And they sure see in some, those who have believed the story, they see new cancers arise.   Cancer has been treated by placebo, though a placebo the doctors had believed at the time. The chemo drugs of the first fifty or sixty years killed rapidly dividing cells. Well hello hello.. there are no rapidly dividing cells in cancer. Sure just under half fell over of the treatment, but more than half went on to \"survive\" in the medical terms, i.e., lived at least 5 to 10 years after treatment with tumor shrinkages and even some tumors disappeared. Indeed some were completely cured of the cancer and lived out their natural life. This is essentially no treatment made them well. If they believed, as did the doctors, that the drugs would address their underlying issues, which were the issues that gave rise to the cancer, then the body cleans up. The cancer is not killed by the immune system. The majority of the cells die by programmed cell death , apoptosis and some even convert back to normal cells. This I saw for myself, though not through scientific observational means. I used Insight Meditation to make the observations in my body.   The reality is that the body makes cancer stem cells and they make the cancer. And when the spontaneous remission happens at least some of the cancer stem cells are stored for future use, should it be seen to be needed. I have cancer stem cells in my body now for the last ten years and they will never come into use again because I know the possible harm or possible danger is a load of baloney being presented by those that \"want me to go away permanently\".  A lot of effort has been made by a lot of inhumane people and for more than 20 years now in a more organized manner. All that they have achieved is to wake me up and make me more knowledgeable. And I am informing others. Their methods are being exposed.
