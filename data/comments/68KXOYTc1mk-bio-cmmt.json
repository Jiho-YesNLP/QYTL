This Matter of Genetics and The Modality of Experimentation Therein.  1) Model Organisms are Small, Inexpensive Ways to study Genetics (I Slightly Concur); 2) Forward Genetic Screen (FGS): 1) Identification of Genes; and 2) Mechanism of Gene (Structure and Function); 3) Hypothesis of Effect in Knockout Specie for Modality of Procedure in Analysis; 4) Trial And Error (Inference basis); 5) Genotype-Phenotype Analysis (Through Variation in Gene Structure); a) Notch Signaling Axis (Dysmorphogenesis of Wings) via Homozygous Recessive Inheritance Pattern; b) Wnt Signaling Axis is Developmental and Genetic; c) Hedgehog Signaling Axis Crossing of Homozygous Recessive (Variant Genes) shows Gene-Phenotype Correlations; 6) Most Variations in these Genes is Onco-genic (Oncogenes implying Transformation from Proto-Oncogene to Oncogene); a) Developmentally Relevant Genes and Signaling Axis (Pathways); b) Pharmaceutically Relevant and Therapeutics therein (Hedgehog Signaling Inhibition); c) MIT-Related Roundworm (Caenorhabitis Elegans; 947 Somatic Cells Totality Organism; 131 Apoptosis-Fated Cells) in Organogenesis and Apoptosis Signaling (Second Messenger Axises); Mutant Roundworm Crossing With other CEd-1 Variants (Mutant C. elegans); d) Apoptosis is Programmed Cell Death and highly Developmental Essentiality (If no Cell Death Gene then there is Agenesis, Aplasia or Pre-natal Death; Loss of Function shows Cell Lumped on the Specimen)-Robert Horwitz; e) Apoptosis Steps are Cell, Death of Cell (Programmed and Developmental) and lastly the Debris is Phagocytized;  7) Circadian Rhythm (Life's Sleep-Wake Cycle of Mammals or Animals); Dorsophila melanogaster (17,ooo Genes) genetic Screening shows variation in Mutant Flies (alternations in Sleep-Wake Patterns)-Konopka and Menzer; a) Behavior and Genetic Variant Correlation identifying the Mutant-Variant Behavior Changes (Sleep-Wake Alterations Identified; Positive for Circadian Rhythm Function through correlation); b) Period Gene Discovery in Flies (Human Gene Homologue);  c) Familial Advance Sleep Syndrome (FASS) Correlation to Human Disease (Human Genome is significant with a total of 20,000 Genes) and Gene;  PhD Adam Martin, es geht gut zu wieder lernen mit ihnen aber wir muessen gehen gerade aus vorwarts und eintreten im Reichtum und Recht jetzt.
