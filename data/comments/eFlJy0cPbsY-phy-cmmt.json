To answer this question one must know the role of surface charges in establishing a current and potential difference in a circuit.   Supposing there is a simple series circuit comprising a battery, wires and a resistor R1 and there is a dead-end branch with a resistor R2 across R1. When the circuit is made then initially electrons flow into both branches, but the surface of the dead-end branch becomes charged so negatively that no more electrons can enter. This prevents current flowing into the dead-end branch. Current of appropriate strength will flow in the R2 branch when the branch is connected across R1.   It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the rearrangement of surface charges which allows current through the branch.   Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two and it is instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos:   i. https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo and ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss surface charges and explains their rearrangement with the help of sequential diagrams in parallel circuits and topics on capacitive and inductive circuits using a unified approach to electrostatics and circuits.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "eFlJy0cPbsY", "cid": "UgyaGGSpPryYn035s-F4AaABAg", "comment": "I've been stuck trying to understand this for two days until I watched your video.

Find total resistance from right to left, back to the source voltage. Then figure the total current by Ohms law. Now, going from left to right...figure your voltage drops across  R1 and R6. Then subtract those voltages from the source voltage. Divide the 15 volts by R2 resistance to get 1.5 amps, which is half of the total current. The other 1.5 amps goes thru the rest of the circuit, or just divide the 15 volts by the total resistance of the three resistors in the far right part of the circuit.
