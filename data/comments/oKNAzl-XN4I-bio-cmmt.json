When this isolated group is re-integrated into a larger population, their cooperative model outcompetes the patterns of the larger population. The founder-driven trait of cooperation will crystalise outwards until the larger population joins in.   E.g. a single ethnic group marginalised in one society learns to be cooperative. When introduced to a different society, their cooperative nature is sdvantageous and makes them so successful that everyone in that society must join their cooperative culture.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugx5ICjXgxxI1UWkw814AaABAg", "comment": "43:05 inter-sex competition: In tournament species, males prioritise the success of only THEIR reproductive offspring, without concern for the future reproductive success of the females with whom they are mating. Females from such species, seeking to preserve reproductive vitality for future cycles, must protect themselves.  Imprinted genes - genes whose phenotypic manifestations vary depending on which parent they were inherited from.  Mechanism: Methylation of one copy from one parent  inactivates/silences it. So only the other copy from the other parent is functional.   Paternal copies tend to promote fetal growth and metabolism (even at the expense of the mother's vitality) Maternal copies tend to slow this down (to preserve the mother's vitality)  E.g. paternal genes can code for IGF in offspring, promoting fetal growth Maternal genes can code for less responsive IGF receptors in offspring to counter-balance the paternal component.   E.g. 2: paternal genes code for placental invasion into the uterine wall; materal genes slow this down.  If the paternal gene is knocked out, you get a disease where fertilised eggs don't implant. If the maternal gene is knocked out, you get choriocarcinoma as where the uterus grows out of control at the prompting of the fetus.   E.g. 3: post-partum imprinted genes: paternal gene promotes more infant suckling; maternal gene blunts some suckling reflexes.   E.g. 4 foetal lactogen enzyme makes it easier for a foetus to get sugar out of the mother's bloodstream. If the mother is not effective at countering this, mother gets pregnancy hypoglycemia.   E.g. 5: houseflies are a tournament species in which many males mate with a single female, so at a point, a female may have the sperm of multiple males within her simultaneously . male houseflies' sperm produce substances toxic to the sperm of other males to competitively exclude them. If left to evolve stronger toxins, the males' can become so toxic that they reduce the life expectancy of females.   These examples display that tournament males are in competition even with the very same female with whom they successfully reproduce.  Humans have imprinted genes (unlike pair-bonding species) but not as many as pure/out-and-out tournament species", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgzlgJZUOtHKiroQqXd4AaABAg", "comment": "Hernandez Margaret Jackson Donna Martinez Jessica", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugyl_5a0Eu1XB_XD-jh4AaABAg", "comment": "Martinez Karen Taylor Sarah Moore Betty", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugw0fgPePYIEN5nkPzt4AaABAg", "comment": "Thompson Timothy Lopez Jessica Allen Jason", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugxm0R4N-RAo2wQin954AaABAg", "comment": "Martin Kimberly Robinson Richard Young Anthony", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugz1QvxPu5scTXGeBFh4AaABAg", "comment": "Worst cameraman ever just sayin watching makes me nauseous I have to listen only", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgzCvlYs02UUXg9BG1B4AaABAg", "comment": "Harris Maria Jackson Michelle Wilson Sandra", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgyomW7jxQx70uqA_KZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Rodriguez Patricia Jones Kimberly Garcia Karen", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugw7Mic0diemhdJF2M54AaABAg", "comment": "It was indeed Francois Jacob, not Lwoff who said that Evolution is a tinkerer.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgzDKVq48JBlTlvxZG94AaABAg", "comment": "Very engaging course but I wonder if the knowledge presented is still up to date in 2024", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugx3LEc59B_yTZWDzU14AaABAg", "comment": "People: \"cite your sources properly!\" This guy: \"I'm gonna say it was Lwoff because I like saying Lwoff\"", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugz_N_Q_ZeugFjYFywt4AaABAg", "comment": "Professor Sapolsky.

Cooperative behaviors rely on kinship and game theory.  Cooperative behaviors in animals are facilitated by kinship and relatedness, with evolutionary logic applied to develop effective strategies for gene transmission. Game theory provides context for determining the strength and effectiveness of these cooperative efforts.  2. Species exhibit tournament or pair-bonded behavior patterns.  Social behavior in animal species can be interpreted as being either tournament or pair-bonded. Tournament species show competition traits with males tending to be larger and more aggressive, while pair-bonded species have high levels of male parenting and low aggression levels.  3. Infanticide is prevalent in certain animal species.  Infanticide, or the killing of infants, is observed in many animal species. This behavior is more likely to occur when the offspring is from another male. In some rodent species, the arrival of a new male can cause pregnant females to miscarry due to stress hormone release.  4. Reproductive strategies are diverse and unique in animal societies.  Unique mating strategies and behaviors are observed in animal societies, such as delphic polyandry and migratory tournament species. Factors like sex ratio, social context, and kinship play a role in shaping these strategies and maintaining stable reproductive units.  5. Imprinted genes affect fetal growth and development.  Imprinted genes are crucial in the balance between male and female genes during fetal growth and development. These genes function differently depending on whether they originate from the mother or father and can lead to diseases or conflicts over calorie intake if mutated.  6. Sperm competition and gender dispersal are evident in primates.  In primates and other mammals, sperm competition and gender dispersal during puberty help avoid inbreeding. Bizarre adaptations may develop from the co-evolutionary arms race between males and females, such as detoxifying sperm or organized warfare in male chimps.  7. Group selection theory promotes cooperation.  Group selection theory posits that cooperation develops through inbred kin selection and trade crystallization, leading to group behavior based on individual traits. This theory has resurfaced in recent studies on the success of Calvinism in 17th-century Zurich.  8. Sociobiology and evolutionary biology involve controversies.  Sociobiology and evolutionary biology face criticism for assuming adaptive purposes for all traits, neglecting alternative explanations and environmental factors. Nevertheless, heritability, adaptiveness, and gradual evolutionary change remain essential for understanding behavioral evolution.

This is never small talk, but an interrupted flow of statements, citations of facts, constantly referring to what he calls \u201cthe literature\u201d, the sum of published papers in the scentific journals related to his topic. He sounds as if he never pauses to catch his breath, even though he does, quite imperceptibly, and does not seem to need to prepare in his mind his next sentence (unlike for instance Obama).  This continuous flow of speech is mind-boggling. He is not acting as if he were following a set text that had become intimately mastered for having been repeated year after year.  His method is a bit freer. He just needs to grab a key word, a concept, a fact, and that single lead is enough to set him off into a non-stop discussion of the point  for as long as he has time. And those lead concepts are all spelled out in the notes spread in front of him on the desk. He needs a simple glance from afar to end the current point with a resonant \"OK\" and launch the new segment. He knows the whole extent of each point, and all the related tangents, so well that he can freely let his mind navigate in multiple directions and tangents in that vast territory without losing the thread of his destination and without having to control or edit what comes next. A few times, he realizes he is drifting too far afield, catches himself, and switches directions. But this self-correction is nearly instantaneous, a second or two. He is more like a geyser, or a torrent, than a river. His speech is not so much a flow as a continuous eruption, with many branches that all return to the point.. And I think there\u2019s more to it than just being thoroughly familiar with his subject, or even an ease due to repeating the same points year after year. Beyond knowledge and memory, I suspect there\u2019s a neural engine in his brain that sets his speech into motion with enough energy to  go on for one or two hours without taking a break. And this engine does not start in first gear, but in fourth. The source of this energy is a personal neurological trait distinct from memory. Watch Barack Obama, who also knows his subject very well, and rehashes the same points of his intellectual life over and over during his public career. However, at the opposite of Sapolsky, Obama mentions a fact, an idea, and then stops, letting it sink, while surveying his audience to judge if they are imbibing his words, and appreciate their weight. It is not that Obama is hesitating, not at all. Like Sapolsky, Obama knows very well what target he is aiming at, but he takes his time. The mountain is there and he knows exactly how to climb it, and all the ways that get to the summit. But he is not in a hurry to speed towards his goal. Whereas Sapolky is driven by his inner engine to rush forward at full speed, as if subject to a mental force that keeps accelerating his output. This is an unstoppably driving engine that Obama does not have, and does not need.  I have watched Sapolsky\u2019s 25 lectures of this Stanford Un. course twice, with some lectures more than twice. I have also watched most of the seminars given to the public and posted on YouTube, and some more than once. The same mental engine is at work in every one of his oral deliveries.  At some point when he was starting to adib on his subject, he murmured to himself, \u201cI\u2019ll stop now because I feel a <surge, fit, tirade> coming\u201d, that is, he is feeling his engine continuing to spin on its own, and is concerned about getting carried by this engine too far, too long considering the time allotted to his presentation . At some point I\u2019ll come across that moment again and will note exactly the word he used.  All this to say that Sapolsky\u2019s very idiosyncratic style is not just due to his intimate knowledge of his subject, which he has mastered without any doubt like any expert does, but to a special, personal brain trait which I compare here to a kind of spontaneous speeding engine that just needs to be jump started. Sapolsky must know the neurobiological description of his own trait and which parts of the brain are involved. This should be the object of a special investigation: What is the neurobiology of Sapolsky's own brain?", "votes": "7", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgyXc9MMHCxTB30Wdqx4AaABAg", "comment": "... and the answer is somewhere in the middle", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgyUGNO75zsJdCbbvmp4AaABAg", "comment": "Haven't heard of Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom in decades.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgzVX6bMdsmfRvRQC3R4AaABAg", "comment": "16:49  31:29  50:58   1:03:49 done", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgzixdgJ9S2rmIvwg4B4AaABAg", "comment": "\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0430\u0439\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0433\u043e, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0443\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0451\u043d \u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0438", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgwsyEG1EqrlInA2Q9l4AaABAg", "comment": "YEA\u270a\ud83c\udffc", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgyQDsWl5c1Dy-y-duF4AaABAg", "comment": "omg a truth sayer", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugxi9otqaSiK2ZPogYx4AaABAg", "comment": "Off subject but a friend of mine is the nephew of Jane goodall.

From what little I know, smell seems to be a common theme. Some plants seem to recognize kin by 'root exudates' (underground smell, if you will). I think sight was generally a bad candidate (too unreliable). I wonder if sound is a factor in any animals.   Sapolsky mentions some species (mammals, for instance lions) wherein a new alpha male tends to kill any children in the herd, because they're not his and he wants the females not to waste time and energy on them. Then he mentions in at least one case already-pregnant females deceive new alpha males by simulating ovulation and mating with him. In that case, the male hasn't evolved any effective mechanism to determine that the kids aren't his (and certainly doesn't have the capacity to think about the duration of gestation). He only has the instinct to kill the babies that are already there when he arrives (which can't possibly be his), no mechanism for recognition required.  Of course where species do have mechanisms in operation, they won't work a 100% of the time, i.e. individuals will be seen as closely related while they aren't and vice versa. Nothing has to be foolproof, if a mechanism arises that gets it right most of the time, and getting it right is an advantage (i.e. increases chance of your genes reproducing), that's enough!

I used to take medication, however, it tended to make me feel unmotivated. I have since learned to cope with it better; to practice focus and redirect myself back to to the task, where needed, if my thoughts begin to wonder. I find ritualistic motions (like moving my hand to indicate moving forward in a straight line), combined with utterances (such as \"come on now\") help to get me back on track when I need to.  It isn't always successful, and some days I'm not as productive as I'd like to be at work. Other days, I'll do better and make up for it.  Part of ADHD for many, too, is finding yourself thinking too far ahead and overwhelming yourself with thought. I find again similar ritual motions and phrases help.  Another thing that helps is to engage with the things that mean the most to you and that you find naturally enthralling. I find that on subjects I find most interesting, I'm naturally more focused. Cognitively demanding tasks, when they are naturally fascinating to you, can have a way of capturing your entire awareness.  I haven't taken medication for it in years by now, however. I don't remember so clearly what it was really like while on it.  However, I do recall when I stopped (immediately with no weening period), I felt like I was losing my mind.  If you suspect you may have it, and still want to do something about it, I would recommend seeking medical advice, and figuring out how you want to proceed.  There are many different disorders between which the characteristic traits share a decent overlap, meaning it isn't possible to reliably diagnose without significant context and analysis of behavioural and emotional patterns.

The family of kiwi is the same as ostriches, Emu, Ema, etc.. so, maybe, they \"shrank\" to be more adaptable for their Island environment, and maybe the egg is more of a heritage than an adaptation .

This is the message of forgiveness of sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In first Corinthians, chapter 15 verses 1 to 4, the apostle Paul states:  \u201cMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you, first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures\u201d.  Romans chapter 3 verse 23, informs us,   \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God\u201d.    Ultimately it is a redeeming plan set by God, and for anybody who will faithfully trust in his Son will be saved.   Romans chapter 6 verse 23, says,  \u201cFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\u201d.  A sinner must recognise the despairing of her or his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take effect.   Every believer must understand in order to inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king, the reality and foundational truth of sin must be acknowledged, for all who approach the throne of God for salvation.   God promises us eternal life, for anybody who departs from sin through the saving faith in Jesus Christ.     Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life which no person could live. Jesus\u2019s sacrifice on the cross ultimately paid the debt we owe to God for our sin.  Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice; and Jesus died a substitutionary death for the sinner.   In short, the works of Jesus paid the penalty of sin through an infinite sacrifice. Only the creator of life has the power to resurrect life after death and is essentially the proof of the power of God.  Jesus Christ offers his salvation as a free gift and only be received by faith, despite any works or worthiness on our part.   The scripture in Romans informs us,  \u201cIf you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u201d.  In conclusion, the resurrection of Christ is to bring everlasting life and salvation to anybody who follows him. The relationship between God and man can be restored through his saving faith.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "UgxvDtV2cz5X6l-X_u14AaABAg", "comment": "Dang, I hate how the videos cut off mid-sentence!

Two problems, or two issues, that are all we'll touch on at this point.  The first one is, there is this temptation, as soon as you think along these lines, to discover, oh, isn't that interesting? Langur monkeys will have infanticide. Male langur monkeys will kill the kids of some other male. Human males do that sometimes. Oh, langur monkeys might be an interesting evolutionary model for where infanticidal behavior came from in humans.Oh, isn't this interesting? Dominance is passed along by males. We do that sometimes isn't it interesting? Kidnapping somehow occurs. And before you know it, you have a world in which people are saying, well, damselflies do something that look like rape. So huh, we've got a damselfly model of human behavior in that realm.  And two things are happening there. One is taking the traits, a small number of traits, in some other species and inflating the relevance it has for understanding us. The other danger is that somewhere, creeping below the surface, is you see it happens in other species. It's kind of natural. It's kind of inevitable. This is a whole world in which people have run off with how this applies to humans in a completely distorted way.  We are unique as a species, as is every other species. We are unique. By applying the same evolutionary rules that every other species has, that's the commonality, not the outcome.  The other challenge is constantly going to be that you get all these great predictive models, and then humans go and screw it up by having quirks and idiosyncrasies and personalities and stuff like that. All I can say in that realm is, back to Wednesday, if making sense of which lions are going to go to the scary speaker in the bushes there revolves, in some part, around personalities, humans, by the time you get to us, blindly assuming these models apply is going to be very shaky.

The reason there is to stop fragmentation of land as children of one mother are more likely to stay together but this is the secondary reason here. The primary reason is something disgusting. Haryana had a long history of female infanticide as a society valued males instead of females. This sick ideology has led to a point where there are a minimum number of females in their society and they go to different places like the state of Kerala, or West Bengal or the North-Eastern states of India and buy a woman and have her playing wife to 2, 3 or 4 brothers with them sharing her. Because it isn't like you get anything for free and people with small landholdings aren't financially comfortable enough to buy a woman for each brother.  I'm sure someone will say that I'm talking through my hat and you can't buy or sell women in India as it is a democracy. That should have been the way but then even female infanticide is a crime but we know that Haryana males can't find a wife for them and have to compromise on their stupid social rules of marrying within their caste and are open to women from a culture that is alien to them. It's not like it is 0urely a purchase there is a proper marriage but those states have more women than men and thus they are open to agreeing for this polyandry.

The English come along and pronounce the word the way it is spelled which sounds so offensive to us.

Great content. In many ways, this is better than paying for and having to physically attend a lecture at Stanford, much less an inferior school with mediocre professors. Here, I can have the subtitles play, making it easier to hear his words and digest the content. I can slow the video, rewind if I missed something or my attention was momentarily averted, pause the video to think about something he just presented before I hear more, etc. I suppose the downside to watching this on YouTube is that perhaps I'd be more likely to have outside distractions (phone, etc) than if I was sitting in the lecture, though there would be different distractions (other students for example). Some people would argue that one can't interact with the professor,  ask questions, etc. This seems like a pretty big lecture and therefore what is the likelihood the average student would even ask a question? Pretty low. I think I heard one or two questions in that 90 minutes. Why would someone pay for this when they can get it for free and watch 2 lectures in the time it takes to travel back and forth, sit down, wait for class to start and watch one of these lectures at a designated time that may or may not fit well into their schedule. There has been and will continue to be an huge shift in education now that the technologies that make it cheap and affective are in place and widespread. Hell, I can watch this on my iphone while I'm riding riding the subway.  My main critique of that he should try to move back and forth less.

I've recently begun looking through MIT OCW and was amazed to realize the thoroughness of the whole thing: they have just about every class they offer on there, for free, and it looks like many of them have the entire gambit of material; ie. they not only have the tape recorded lectures, but also have the syllabus, anything the teacher handed out... It's basically everything you would get from going to a class minus the credits (obviously) and the ability to go to class physically which clearly has some invaluable benefits.  Anyways... If anyone knows if the handouts for this class , syllabus, exams, etc are available anywhere ( or if you happen to have gone to this class and still have some or all of the relevant material at hand) it would be much appreciated.

The major point being inevitable logic and how it is based off the building blocks of individual selection, kin selection and cooperative altruism. \r -\tThe professor then notes the patterns of inevitable logic that have been identified in tournament and pair bonding species (and continues to do so for the first sixty minutes of class) 7:55 Minutes 11-20:\r -\tThe professor reports that the work done on Lauinger monkeys by Sara Hrdy in the 1970\u2019s identified that humans are not the only species to kill or commit infanticide. Infanticide is the killing of an infant before its first year of life is fulfilled. The professor clarifies that these murders have a pattern.\r -\tThe professor specifies  patterns are that the murderers tend to be males and the prey murdered by the males are most often children of other males and that these murders are committed in an attempt to enhance their chances to pass on their genes. Therefore, these animals were working from the standpoint of individual selection. A few animals that follow these patterns are mountain gorillas, lions, and various species of monkeys (such as Langer monkeys, Vervet monkeys and Pygmy monkeys)\r -\tThe professor then gives additional examples of how other species (horses 19:18 and rodents 19:37) practice infanticide.\r Minutes 21-30:\r -\tThe professor gives additional examples of how varies species practice inevitable logic and its building blocks. Langer Monkeys 22:20 and Savannah Baboons 26:50. Minutes 31-40:\r -\tThe professor discusses sex ratio fluctuations as it pertains to individual selection and social context 31:36 The example the professor provides primarily states that having a daughter is a Conservative Strategy because a daughter is less calorically taxing. Thus, females are born in times of high vulnerability. Having a male is physically more taxing which typically results in only high-ranking species taking the hit to produce a male because it is not a Conservative Strategy it is a Risky Strategy.\r -\tThe professor discusses role of kinship amongst various species and how polyandry and adelphic polyandry may be present in these roles. 36:50  (The specific example given is in lion prides and humans. When there are two male leaders of a lion\u2019s pride it is usually adelphic polyamory. That is the two leaders are brother\u2019s aka adelphic polyamory. In humans this can be seen when one woman marries a multitude of brothers. Adelphic polyandry amongst humans usually occurs in agriculturally impoverished areas. The logic of why humans and lions practice adelphic polyandry are the same. The logic is kin selection. It is to increase the chances of passing down genetic coding.)\r Minutes 41-50:\r -\tThe professor briefly discusses intersexual competition as it pertains to individual selection 41:53\r -\tThe professor discusses imprinted genes (a concept developed in the 1990\u2019s) and reproductive strategies of imprinted genetic mechanisms regarding individual selection 43:09\r (Methylation is the genetic mechanism that causes imprinted genes. In simpler terms Methylation is what makes genes work differently ergo imprinted genes. Imprinted genes work differently depending on which parent they come from. Imprinted genes from males usually are all genes that enhance fetal growth by making receptors more sensitive to insulin like growth factor. Imprinted genes that come from females are all usually genes that slow down genes that decrease fetal growth by making receptors less likely to find insulin like growth factor.)\r -\tThe professor highlights that a lot of the of imprinted genetic mechanisms used between partners are destructive to the reproductive longevity of the females in that partnership. 47:45\r Minutes 51-60:\r -\tThe professor clarifies you do not find imprinted genes in pair bonding species. Imprinted genes are found in tournament species and those that fall in a category of a hybrid between tournament and pair bonding species aka humans.\r -\tThe professor addresses research done by William Rice of Santa Cruz on the sperm competition amongst flies. Sperm of certain flies kill sperms of other males. However, the toxins of the sperm are also toxic to the female flies in which they are ejaculating in. House flies are not a pair bonding species so this makes sense from an investable logic point of view. 52:22\r -\tThe professors introduce the concept of an animal leaving its initial community at puberty. Specifically, he discusses how in the chimp species females leave and in baboons males disperse at puberty. Therefor the males of chimp groups are all brothers and the females of baboons are all sisters.  \r -\tThe professor then asks, based on this information which species have more male on male aggression, chimps, or baboons? The answer is Baboons. The next question is which species have more advanced and productive war patterns. The answer is chimps. This is because there is more kinship in chimps than baboons. 56:05\r Minutes 61-70:\r -\tSo the professor spent the first sixty minutes of class discussing different scenarios in which the building block of inevitable logic comes into play, now, the professor attests that group selection (behaving for the good of the group) also comes into play within the world of inevitable logic but only under a few circumstances. Those circumstances include the Founder Effect and a more Generalized Founder Effect\r -\tThe professor begins to discuss the Founder Affect. 1:00:32\r The Founder Effect= Something happens that isolates a small subset of a population. The sections go about reproducing and the population with less people will be more inbred. Levels of corporation will be higher in the group with more inbred occurrence. So, there is a high level of corporation due to kin selection. The high productivity of the small subset of people develops is so advantages that that behavior turns into an adaptable gene which enters the major population.\r To put it simply, the mass productivity amongst the inbred founder population drives larger populations to cooperative altruism in order to try to become equally if not more so productive.\r -\tThe professor then begins to discuss A Second Scenario in which group selection can come into play. 1:07:44\r Generalized Founder Effect = You have got chickens with an array of traits one aggressive chicken lays a lot of eggs and one pacific chicken lays little eggs. The aggressive chicken lays a lot of eggs that produce babies and the passive chickens do not. This results in a lot of aggressive chickens that attack each other. This leads to low fertility rates amongst the aggressive subset of chickens. So now we are in this very important world where figuratively \u201cgroup A can dominate group B but where groups of B will dominate groups of A.\u201d So the group of aggressive chickens could together take out the pacific chickens, bust individually isolated from the other group  the aggressive group of chickens (group A) would likely kill each other off leaving the passive group of chickens alive and ready to pass on their genes. \r Minutes 71-80:\r -\tThe professor addresses the work of David Sloan Wilson \u201cDarwin\u2019s Cathedral\u201d where he analyzes clusters of new religion over time and highlights how they are based in the found effect, group selection like properties and inbred cooperative strategies. \r -\tThe professor begins to discuss Multi-Level Selection 1:11:09\r Multi-Level Selection = Sometime selection is entirely dependent on one gene.\r -\tThe professor moves on to discuss that when predicting behavior remember that social behavior is dictated by acting in whatever way one must in order to maximize the potential in passing down there gene which may be thwarted by kin selection and then by cooperative altruism and at times (but rarely group selection). \r -\tThe professor then goes about addressing the popular criticisms given to the tenants he just stated/listed above. The criticisms negating the primary tenants of inevitable logic which are as follows: heritability, adaptiveness, and gradualism.\r Minutes 81-90:\r -\t The professor addresses the criticism against heritability 1:20:08\r -\tThe professor addresses the criticism against adaptiveness and discusses adaptative fallacy 1:20:35\r The professor addresses the criticism of adaptiveness by Steven Jay Gould (Harvard Paleontologist) and Richard Luyeton (Harvard molecular geneticist). The two Harvard men said that behavior did not adapt because of adaptiveness but because they are spandrels. Spandrels are the unavoidable spaces between arches. So, the two Harvard men were essentially saying that some developed behavior has no explanation, it is just there. \r -\tThe professor addresses the criticism against gradualism 1:30: 22\r Minutes 91-106:\r -\tThe professor addresses punctuated equilibrium. 1:31:08\r Punctuated Equilibrium = The argument that there can be moments of stagnancy followed by great change with no gradual nature present aka \u201cthe hypothesis that evolutionary development is marked by isolated episodes of rapid speciation between long periods of little or no change.\u201d\r -\tThe professor clarifies who the harshest critics of this theory really are 1:33:38\r -\tThe professor clarifies that although there are a lot of hot takes on why inevitable logic is wrong the most popular criticism is that is justifies immoral behavior.", "votes": "108", "replies": "11", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oKNAzl-XN4I", "cid": "Ugxc8uHzOLtnboe-uJ14AaABAg", "comment": "I'm in love of this course.
