The penny dropped after I thought about it.   The determinant is the scaling factor of the area. When you multiply the x with the y and vice versa you're just working out the area/volume, the same as you would on a graph. Say if you had a basis matrix with x, y and z vectors all running in the same direction. Then the determinant is zero, there's no area covered. If you multiplied a matrix by a scalar then you scale the determinant.   So, it makes sense that we take the expanded determinant of two vectors with the identity vector we can output a third vector which is orthogonal to the other two: the cross product.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CcbyMH3Noow", "cid": "UgzyHKawpKv0CTQpdb14AaABAg.9MOShwfb_Ba9jJTesLVs3_", "comment": "same", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CcbyMH3Noow", "cid": "Ugysur1B9X7gZdNJG0J4AaABAg.9JB0bQPNCHv9OeNOh0_zfm", "comment": "I tried once with paper and pen only and I got -340 too.

I entered all the numbers in a spreadsheet (not using any calculations, just using it to have my numbers structured and easy to follow and edit), and I still got it wrong, but this time it was just my brain not working. I calculated -9\u00b762 as -358 for some reason (or maybe I did a typo), so the result ended up at -138. It's -558, of course (9\u00b7(60+2)=540+18=558), and the end result is -338, just as the video clearly states. The results of the 3\u00b73 determinants are: 14, 94, -62 and -3. Multiply each one with 1, -2, 9 and 6 respectively and add and subtract using those rules, and we get: 1\u00b714-(-2\u00b794)+(-9\u00b762)-(-6\u00b73) = 14+188-558+18=-338. Yay! \ud83d\ude01 It's actually easy. The tough part is to not mess up the numbers, since there are so many of them.
