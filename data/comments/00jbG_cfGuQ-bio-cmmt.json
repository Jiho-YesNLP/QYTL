Cells use ATP or Adenosine Triphosphate as their energy currency, but where does it come from? It is created through a process known as cellular respiration consisting of three parts, Glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and the electron transport chain. Inside the cell's cytoplasm a Glucose molecule is turned into two Pyruvates and two NADH molecules through a process called glycolysis. Each of those pyruvates are then turned into three NADH molecules and one FADH2 by the Krebs cycle. Next, The NADHs from the Krebs Cycle and Glycolysis along with the FADH2 molecules are deposited inside the Mitochondrial Matrix. There are a set of four Complexes along the inner membrane of the mitochondria that take two electrons from each NADH and each FADH2 and pump out a total of six hydrogen Ions into the Intermembrane space, the area between the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria. This creates an electrochemical gradient, meaning that those Hydrogen Ions want to get back into the Mitochondrial Matrix. A fifth Complex Lets these hydrogen ions run back through, like water through a water wheel. It uses the energy generated by the movement of the hydrogen ions to put together ADT, or Adenosine Diphosphate with An extra phosphate creating Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP. The NADHs and FADH2s from one glucose molecule create 34 ATP molecules, as well as two extras as a byproduct of the Krebs cycle and four as byproducts of glycolysis. Take away two because of the initial two ATP spent doing glycolysis and one Glucose Molecule can be turned into 38 ATPs", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "00jbG_cfGuQ", "cid": "UgxQLIulsyVKQrQBuk94AaABAg", "comment": "Apparently after reading comments...

I provided one-to-one assistance to a student who was born with Mitochondria and hydrocephalus.  Hydrocephalus does not necessarily cause any disabilities or developmental delays if caught and treated early.  My daughter's father was born with hydrocephalus and is a very healthy, athletic 6'3\" 44 year old. Mitochondria is a rare condition with little information known so much more unknown. My general understanding is the body is not able to store & metabolize protein.  The few known information I've  seen states mitochondria comes from the maternal side (I am not sure if they are referring to the condition, disease?)  How is it determined that the disabling condition mitochondria (or the lack of mitochondria passed on to the child) comes from the mother?   All healthy functional adults have mitochondria, without it we wouldn't be able to do basic daily functions like pick up our toothbrush and brush our teeth.  A child's chromosome (DNA) comes from the half paternal and half maternal.  How is it the insufficient/weak/mutated/excessive (I don't think excessive is a possible reason for mitochondria) mitochondria does not come from the paternal side and the condition is link with the maternal?  Perhaps there's new findings I don't know about but can you please explain what mitochondria condition or is it a disease is?  How mitochondria (is only) linked to be contributed from the maternal side?", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "00jbG_cfGuQ", "cid": "UgwwW2YLFgp-hzH7Put4AaABAg", "comment": "This is by far the worst and most confusing video of this series so far.

It leaves the Hydrogen inside the thylakoid, floating around, while the oxygen exits the membrane.  One of the electrons breaks away from the chlorophyll and immediately hops onto a special thing called an electron transport protein. The transport protein then transports the electron to the second protein complex, the Cytochrome complex. The cytochrome complex uses some of the energy from the electron to pump more hydrogen protons into the thylakoid. The hydrogen protons, now inside the thylakoid, are brought into the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase packs the Hydrogen proton onto the ADP making ATP the original electron, now completing its journey, is moved into PSI where it is reenergized by a photon. The Re-energized electron then moves into the NADP+ Reductase where all of its energy is used to make NADPH out of 2 electrons and 1 hydrogen ion along with NADP+ The NADPH, along with the ATP\u2019s, then moves into the second leg of photosynthesis, the light independent reactions, called the Calvin cycle.  Light independent reactions the first part occurs in the stroma and is called carbon fixation. It is called this because this is where a CO2 molecule binds with a Molecule of Ribulose Bisphosphate. This is done by an enzyme called rubisco.  Rubisco, which was originally designed to harvest inorganic carbon from the atmosphere and then convert it to organic carbon, is not very good at its job. The RuBisCo would accidentally bind the Ribulose bisphosphate with oxygen more than half of the time, creating a toxic by product.  When the rubisco works correctly, it will slam a CO2 molecule into ribulose bisphosphate, which will then become incredibly unstable. The only way to keep the new molecule stable is to split it in half, making 2 molecules of Phosphoglycerate. This whole process must be done to 3 molecules of RUBP.  In stage 2, the Phosphoglycerate needs more energy so some ATP somes by and adds a phosphate group, and then some NADPH adds some electrons. This process creates 2 molecules of G3P. G3P, the final product of photosynthesis can then be easily converted to many different molecules, the most important of which is glucose. However, the plant needs 5 of these G3P\u2019s to replenish the electrons lost and to replenish the original 3 RUBPs. This last phase is called regeneration.

China uses a different currency. But cells use ATP as chemically stored potential energy. Just saying 'energy' without specifying the specific type of energy is meaningless. It's like new age hippy nonsense like 'feel the energy all around you.'     When ATP loses a phosphate molecule or more specifically a molecular ion, kinetic energy is released when the phosphate molecular ion is shot off from the ATP molecule, as well as an electron is released thus creating heat in the form of electricity. And you end up with an ADP then the ADP gets another phosphate molecule in the Krebs cycle during oxidative phosphoralation. So ATP  to ADP and there and back again to ATP making it a cycle. Only if you don't have enough ATP does your body uses ADP for energy. When ADP loses a phosphate you end up kinetic energy from the phosphate shooting off the ADP which becomes Lactic Acid as well as heat from the loose electron. The Lactic Acid is why you 'feel the burn.' when working out.
