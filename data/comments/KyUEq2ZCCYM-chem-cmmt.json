Determining who gains and loses electrons is based upon oxidation states.  But if you look at the foundation of oxidation states, they kind of treat every bond as being an ionic bond.  To this end the 'shared' electrons in a covalent bond are assigned to whichever atom is more electronegative.  This is obviously not a perfect reflection of reality for molecular compounds and hence the confusion.  But it does have its utility and is worth the confusion.  Using a more accurate reflection of reality would likely involve complex mathematical equations to better approximate true 'charges' on atoms and this would suck so much more.  So accept that it is a little nonsensical, but invest the time to learn the rules for assigning the oxidation states as it will prove useful more than once in this course.
