Since the administrator wants to create 1024 subnets, we need at least 10 bits (2^10 = 1024).   Now, let's break down the steps to find the first and last addresses of the first subnet and the last subnet:  1. *Determine the subnet mask:*    Since we're starting with a /16 network (130.56.0.0/16), and we need 10 bits for subnetting, the new subnet mask will be /26 (16 bits for the original network + 10 bits for subnetting = 26 bits total).  2. *Calculate the subnet size:*    With a /26 subnet mask, each subnet will have 2^(32-26) = 64 IP addresses. However, we'll have to skip two addresses in each subnet (network address and broadcast address), leaving us with 62 usable IP addresses per subnet.  3. *Find the first and last addresses of the first subnet:*    - First address: The first subnet will start at 130.56.0.0 (network address) + 1 = 130.56.0.1    - Last address: The last usable address in the first subnet will be 130.56.0.0 (network address) + 62 = 130.56.0.62  4. *Find the first and last addresses of the last subnet:*    - To find the last subnet, we need to determine the network address of the last subnet and then calculate the first and last addresses accordingly.    - Since there are 1024 subnets and each subnet has 64 addresses, the last subnet will start at 130.56.0.0 (network address of the original network) + 1024 * 64 (addresses per subnet) = 130.56.64.0    - First address of the last subnet: 130.56.64.0 (network address) + 1 = 130.56.64.1    - Last address of the last subnet: 130.56.64.0 (network address) + 62 = 130.56.64.62  So, the answers are: - First subnet: First address = 130.56.0.1, Last address = 130.56.0.62 - Last subnet: First address = 130.56.64.1, Last address = 130.56.64.62", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "EZTQ61njgKI", "cid": "Ugz3cuB2kcpVaTrwu-R4AaABAg", "comment": "The reservation process is from left to right i guess.
