Cholesterol doesn\u2019t affects the fluidity of the cell membrane, it only decreases the permeability to small polar molecules like water, permeability\u2260fluidity. Cholesterols can actually help maintain the fluidity when temperature drops down, it keeps phase transition at bay.

Thank you for your comment and question. Actually, Cholesterol content in the membrane is extremely important in regulating the fluidity of the plasma membrane, especially with temperature changes. At High Temperatures: Cholesterol tends to stabilize the membrane by making it less fluid. It restricts the movement of phospholipids, which can prevent the membrane from becoming too permeable or leaky. At Low Temperatures: Cholesterol helps to prevent the membrane from becoming too rigid by preventing the phospholipids from packing too closely together. This ensures that the membrane remains somewhat fluid, which is essential for proper cell function and for maintaining membrane proteins\u2019 mobility and function.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AD8D8pAv-8E", "cid": "Ugwj7Y1gnKSvHKel8KB4AaABAg.9YaPk1IqlNP9YjHumh8OzN", "comment": "Will upload soon", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AD8D8pAv-8E", "cid": "Ugwj7Y1gnKSvHKel8KB4AaABAg.9YaPk1IqlNP9Yjd51GPW9h", "comment": "\u00a0@biologybasics\u00a0 Thank you Mam.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AD8D8pAv-8E", "cid": "Ugwj7Y1gnKSvHKel8KB4AaABAg.9YaPk1IqlNP9xDQKWLA_0k", "comment": "Is this unit 11?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
