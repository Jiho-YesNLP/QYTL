The probability for a extremely large loss are indeed higher in a fat tailed distribution. But it can still be more likely for a 2,33 sigma loss in a normal.   For example, 2 distributions, one normal and one fat tailed with the same mean and variance. Both have 1000 observations. In the normal it will be approx 10 events outside 2,33 sigma, but in the fat tailed it can in the extreme case be 1. If that observation is far enough out in the tail, like 15-20 sigma, then the distributions can still have the same variance. Thus the probability of a 2,33 sigma loss is smaller in the fat tailed.
