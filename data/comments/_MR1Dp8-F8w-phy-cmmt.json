If you push on an object such as ,for example, a wall or a chair, then there is an external force on the object. But, what are you actually doing or what is happening? You are transferring energy to the object in a specific direction. A push on an object is a transfer of energy to the object which means that an external force on an object is a transfer of energy to the object. The amount of energy transferred to an object by an external force would simply reflect the magnitude of the external force. A greater amount of energy transferred to an object would reflect a greater push or external force on the object. The energy transferred to an object by an external force is not the work done on the object.  Work is not really force times displacement(W \u2260 F \u22c5 d) because work is not a function of displacement. We can take a look at this inconsistency here. Let's take the equation Wnet = Fnet \u22c5 d and compare it to Fnet = ma. We find \"net force\" and acceleration on opposite sides of the equation, but we find net force and displacement on the same side of the other equation. We know that a net force causes an acceleration and we also know that net work can only be done by a net force if it causes a displacement. So, why aren't net force and displacement on opposite sides of the equation since a net force causes a displacement in the same way that net force and acceleration are on opposite sides of the equation and a net force causes an acceleration?  The net work done on an object is not equal to the change in kinetic energy of the object because the work-energy principle is incorrect since the work done is not equivalent to the energy transferred. A push or an external force on an object is a transfer of energy to the object and the amount of energy transferred to an object by an external force would simply reflect the magnitude of the external force as explained. A net push or a net external force on an object ,similarly, is a net transfer of energy to the object and the amount of net energy transferred to an object by an net external force would simply reflect the magnitude of the net external force.   There is a net external force on the box to the right and there is a net external force on the ball to the left when the ball collides with the box in your example 5:34. This means that there is a net transfer of energy to the box toward the right and there is a net transfer of energy to the ball toward the left. The amount of energy transferred to the box would simply reflect the magnitude of the net external force on the box by the ball and ,likewise, the amount of energy transferred to the ball would simply reflect the magnitude of the net external force on the ball by the box. The net energy transferred to an object by a net external force is not the net work done on the object.  The net energy transferred to an object by a net external force causes a change in the kinetic energy of the object. The amount of change in kinetic energy of an object would simply reflect the magnitude of the net external force. A greater change in kinetic energy of an object by a net external force would reflect a greater net push or net external force on the object.  The change in kinetic energy of the box is due to the net transfer of energy and the amount of change in its kinetic energy reflects the magnitude of the net external force on the box not the work done on the box. The change in kinetic energy of the ball ,likewise, is due to the net transfer of energy and the amount of change in its kinetic energy reflects the magnitude of the net external force on the ball and not the work done on the ball. The change in kinetic energy of an object by a net external force is not equal to the net work done on the object.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "Ugxywu3fynL3GoNJKk14AaABAg", "comment": "41:05 hilarious", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "UgwjEER6WmmgqP0ibVF4AaABAg", "comment": "As a UX designer, I couldn't help but notice how the simplest detail of the type of font you use for the  questions, makes them a whole lot less intimidating to the viewers that are already terrified of the difficult  topics like me.

Great.  WHY EINSTEIN'S EQUATIONS PREDICT THAT SPACE IS EXPANDING OR CONTRACTING IN AND WITH TIME:  Ultimately and truly, TIME is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INSTANTANEITY is FUNDAMENTAL to the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. ACCORDINGLY, the known mathematical unification of Einstein's equations AND Maxwell's equations (given the addition of A FOURTH SPATIAL DIMENSION) is proven and explained. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Very importantly, outer \"space\" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. (Notice the term c4 from Einstein's equations.) It is CLEARLY proven. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. This is the ultimate unification of physics/physical experience. It ALL makes perfect sense. I have truly unified physics.  Consider THE MAN who IS standing on what is the Earth/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE. (Notice that THE DOME of a person's eye is ALSO VISIBLE.) OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is THE EARTH. The INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND DESCRIPTION) is improved in the truly superior mind. Indeed, the ability of thought to describe OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT IS SIMILAR TO sensory experience. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. It is ALL CLEARLY proven. In fact, I have also clarified, clearly identified, and corrected the limited notion of curved \"SPACE\". MY UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS SURPASSES ALL OTHERS. E=mc2 IS F=ma. A galaxy is basically FLAT. Think !!! GREAT. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE as well. It ALL makes perfect sense. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The Sun AND the Earth are F=ma AND E=mc2, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!! LOOK at what is the BLUE SKY. The EARTH is ALSO blue. NOW, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE.  Beautiful !!!  Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This explains F=ma AND E=mc2. ACCORDINGLY, the rotation of what is THE MOON MATCHES it's revolution. It is fully, CLEARLY, and consistently proven. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY.

Ironically, however, this same statement implies or suggests an equivalence between external force and energy transferred as opposed to work and energy transferred. Since an external force transfers energy to an object then you would naturally think and expect that the amount of energy transferred to the object would reflect the amount of the external force. An external force with a greater magnitude acting on an object ,hence, would be expected to transfer a greater amount of energy transferred to the object.   This means that the energy transferred by an external force causing a displacement would not reflect the work done by the external force. So, the \"something that is accomplished\" that he's referring to work is not the energy transferred to an object by the application of force along a displacement. This brings us back to before.

Secondly, the amount energy that is transferred to an object in the work equation that you know is proportional to the displacement caused by a force with the force being kept constant. So, the displacement does not remain constant and you're not applying more force to an object to transfer more energy to the object when work is done. This means the amount of energy transferred to an object in the work equation that you know increases because the displacement increases due to the displacement not being constant.  Now, you agree that there is a relationship between the amount of external force applied to an object, thereby causing a displacement of the object, and the amount of energy transferred to the object. But, what about when an external force acts on an object with no work done on the object? Do you agree that the external force transfers energy to the object in this case?

But, then there's the other aspect of work as it pertains to energy transferred. The work done on an object is the energy transferred to the object by an external force that is acting on it. The amount of work done on an object by an external force reflects the amount of energy transferred to the object. So, if you use the equation and it shows that no work is done on an object because the external force does not cause a displacement of the object then the equation would falsely show that no energy was transferred to the object by the external force. How do you account for this discrepancy that the equation would falsely show that no energy is transferred by an external force when the object is not displaced and that an external force transfers energy to an object that is not displaced?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "Ugxdfld0PMkSHWd9ymV4AaABAg.9M2qVyRLW8q9pL-kQjoRiQ", "comment": "\u00a0@BTWPhysics\u00a0 do you have an alternative formula?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "Ugxdfld0PMkSHWd9ymV4AaABAg.9M2qVyRLW8q9pL16l1RfcY", "comment": "\u00a0@hodgeconjecture5524\u00a0 You mean do I have an alternative equation for work?

The equations would not make sense to you unless you have an understanding of the concepts involved. We can start off with the work equation here in terms of energy.  W = F\u2022d Energy transferred = F\u2022d  Now, the force is constant and the amount of energy transferred is proportional to and depends on the amount of displacement. So, if an external force is present, then we depend on the displacement to know if there is energy transferred. But, the issue I presented is with an external force that does not cause a displacement. In this case, we can't depend on displacement to know that energy is transferred to the object by the external force. Since we can't depend on displacement this means we have to depend on time. Let's take a look at this.    energy transferred/time = rate of energy transferred energy transferred/time \u2022 T = rate of energy transferred \u2022 T Total energy transferred = rate of energy transferred \u2022 T  I wrote it this way to show the comparison between this equation and the work equation in terms of energy transferred. Take notice that we would have a constant rate of energy transferred or energy that is transferred in place of the constant force. This is the amount of energy transferred per second. Also, take notice that the total amount of energy transferred is proportional to and depends on the amount of time(T) as opposed to displacement that the external force acts on the object.  We can take this further with regard to the external force that transfers energy to the object. An external force on an object is a push or a pull on the object as a result of its interaction with another object. We have a rate of external force or a rate of push or pull on the object which is the amount of push or pull on the object per second. The total amount of push or pull depends on the amount of time(T) that the external force acts on the object.  external force(push or pull)/ time = rate of external force(rate of push or pull) external force(push or pull)/ time \u2022 T  = rate of external force(rate of push or pull) \u2022 T  Total external force(Total push or pull) = rate of external force(rate of push or pull) \u2022 T   We can take this further still by defining external force in terms of energy. A push or a pull on an object transfers energy to the object. This means that a push or a pull on an object can be understood as a transfer of energy or an energy transfer to the object. An external force on an object ,alternatively, can be defined as a transfer of energy to the object as a result of its interaction with another object. We can take this definition for external force into account with the equations now.  transfer of energy(external force)/ time = rate of transfer of energy(rate of external force) transfer of energy(external force)/ time \u2022 T = rate of transfer of energy(rate of external force) \u2022 T Total transfer of energy(Total external force) = rate of transfer of energy(rate of external force)  \u2022 T Total transfer of energy(Total external force) = External Impulse(rate of external force)  \u2022 T  The rate of a transfer of energy is the amount of a transfer of energy per second. Each second that passes there is an amount of an external force or a push or pull on an object which is an amount of an energy transfer per second to the object. An amount of energy is transferred to the object each second that corresponds to the amount of external force each second. Also, the rate of an external force or the rate of a transfer of energy is an external impulse.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "Ugxdfld0PMkSHWd9ymV4AaABAg.9M2qVyRLW8q9pN4xMmGKh0", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@BTWPhysics\u00a0 you better sleep cause you are not a mentally balanced person ...", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "Ugxdfld0PMkSHWd9ymV4AaABAg.9M2qVyRLW8q9pNGerJaohl", "comment": "\u00a0@BTWPhysics\u00a0 it's interesting but it isn't an alternative to the equation for work", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_MR1Dp8-F8w", "cid": "Ugxdfld0PMkSHWd9ymV4AaABAg.9M2qVyRLW8q9pNKUHf2t9I", "comment": "\u00a0@hodgeconjecture5524\u00a0 It's not an alternative to the equation for work and it's not meant to be, but it's an important step in understanding what work is not in order to begin to understand what work is. The important take away with this is that the whole work and energy concept is wrong because work is not the energy transferred to an object by an external force. The energy transferred to an object in total by an external force is proportional to time(T) ,as shown, and not to displacement as the work equation has it to be and it reflects the amount of external force in total as opposed to the work done.  I've pointed out this inconsistency here too which is relevant by comparing the two equations here.  FNet = ma Wnet = Fnet \u2022 d  We find \"net force\" and acceleration on opposite sides of the equation for Newton's second Law, but we find net force and displacement on the same side of the other equation for net work. We know that a net force causes an acceleration and we also know that net work can only be done by a net force if it causes a displacement. If we consider that the equation for net force is correct then why aren't net force and displacement on opposite sides of the equation for work too? After all, a net force causes both an acceleration and a displacement. You would think there would be consistency here between these two equations with regard to this.

Is what you're saying to mean that this doesn't matter because it has allowed us to come this far? On the contrary, it's not really so much our understanding of the underlying Physics that we have come this far as it is our amazing ability to make practical use of things with regard to innovations. But, what if this incorrect understanding of Physics is the reason for all the unresolved problems in Physics and what if this incorrect understanding also acts as a permanent roadblock to being able to really catapult technology onto a whole new level? In this case, a correct understanding of Physics would be necessary for the future.  You completely missed the point of the concept that led to the equations you're referring to. The example I've given with an object that is not displaced by an external force that is acting on it is to show where the concept of work and energy falls apart. An external force that is acting on an object always transfers energy to the object and the work equation is referred to when trying to determine the amount of energy transferred which depends on the displacement of the object. But, displacement in this case cannot be used to determine the energy that is transferred to the object by the external force since the object is not displaced and the work equation falsely shows that no energy is transferred. The only way to determine the transferred energy is by using the time for which the external force acts on the object. Each second that passes there is energy transferred to the object by the external force which means there is a rate of energy transferred. Is that understandable to you? The equations are not for work, but they show how the transferred energy is taken into account.  You are actually conversing with a scientific genius in Physics which is how I'm able to make the claims I make and be able to successfully debate anyone on Physics. However, getting Physicists and ,for the matter, the rest of the world to correct the misunderstanding in Physics is either impossible or next to impossible. This is especially when you consider how much time has passed with the last few hundred years.  I'm a genius in both theoretical Physics and applied Physics. I've been working on a scientific paper ,as mentioned, that busts the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein to develop his General Theory of Relativity. I've also been actively working on completely new and revolutionary propulsion technology ,as mentioned, which will make science fiction a reality. The applications of this new technology include flying cars, a real hoverboard that functions like the one in the movie Back To The Future II,  a real shuttlecraft that functions like in Star Trek that can shuttle people from the surface of the earth up into space, and a real flying saucer.

I've already pointed out everything wrong in this video with the timestamps. But, let's start with his claim at 6:40 that the net work done on an object is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the object which refers to the work-energy theorem. This is represented by the equation Wnet = \u0394KE or ,alternative, by Wnet = fnet * d. We can take these two equations and combine them into the equation \u0394KE = fnet * d. The change in kinetic energy of an object moving at a constant acceleration is proportional to and depends on the displacement of the object acted on by a constant net force.  However, there is no corresponding equation for work as it relates to energy and there should be based on this. This really means that we need to consider work as it relates to energy first before we consider net work as it relates to energy. Work is done on an object when it is acted on by an external force and there is a displacement of the object that is caused by the external force which is represented by the equation W = f * d that has external force as a constant. The work done on an object is proportional to and depends on the displacement of the object acted on by a constant force. But, the work equation breaks down to the equation W = f * vt which would have both force and velocity as being constant. The work done on an object moving at a constant velocity is proportional to and depends on the time the object is acted on by a constant force.   Obviously, the work equation wouldn't reflect the change in kinetic energy of an object since an object moving at constant velocity doesn't have a change in its kinetic energy. But, an object cannot have a change in kinetic energy anyway if there is no energy transferred to it. Energy is transferred to an object that is acted on by an external force. We may relate this to the work equation in that the amount of work done on an object is indicative of the amount of energy transferred to the object acted on by a constant force.   W = f * d Energy transferred = f * d  Now, this seems all nice and good and everything seems to make sense until you consider that no work is even done on an object moving at a constant velocity by an external force. An external force is not required to keep an object in motion and ,so, an object in motion moving at a constant velocity does not require an external force to continue moving at a constant velocity. This also means that the displacement of an object moving at a constant velocity is not caused by an external force that is acting on it and ,hence, no work is done on the object by the external force.  The exception to this general statement is here on Earth with the presence of friction and gravity. Friction and gravity need to be balanced in order for an object to continue moving at a constant velocity. The energy transferred to an object in either scenario only balances out these external \"forces\" allows it to keep moving at a constant velocity and does not cause a displacement of the object.   It is important for you or anyone to understand everything here before I continue on. However, there is no point in continuing if you or anyone cannot first let go of the erroneous thinking that an external force acting on an object that is moving at a constant velocity causes a displacement of an object. This is a very important point because it establishes the fact that work is not done on an object moving at a constant velocity by an external force and that the energy transferred to the object by the external force cannot be used to determine work that is not done by the external force.

This really means that we need to consider wor.k as it relates to energ.y first before we consider ne.t wor.k as it relates to energ.y. wor.k is done on an object when it is acted on by an external forc.e and there is a displacement of the object that is caused by the external forc.e which is represented by the equation W = f * d that has external forc.e as a constant. The wor.k done on an object is proportional to and depends on the displacement of the object acted on by a constant forc.e. But, the wor.k equation breaks down to the equation W = f * vt which would have both forc.e and velocity as being constant. The wor.k done on an object moving at a constant velocity is proportional to and depends on the time the object is acted on by a constant forc.e.   Obviously, the wor.k equation wouldn't reflect the change in kine.tic energ.y of an object since an object moving at constant velocity doesn't have a change in its kine.tic energ.y. But, an object cannot have a change in kine.tic energ.y anyway if there is no energ.y transferred to it. energ.y is transferred to an object that is acted on by an external forc.e. We may relate this to the wor.k equation in that the amount of wor.k done on an object is indicative of the amount of energ.y transferred to the object acted on by a constant forc.e.   W = f * d  energ.y transferred = f * d   Now, this seems all nice and good and everything seems to make sense until you consider that no wor.k is even done on an object moving at a constant velocity by an external forc.e. An external forc.e is not required to keep an object in motion and ,so, an object in motion moving at a constant velocity does not require an external forc.e to continue moving at a constant velocity. This also means that the displacement of an object moving at a constant velocity is not caused by an external forc.e that is acting on it and ,hence, no wor.k is done on the object by the external forc.e.  The exception to this general statement is here on Earth with the presence of friction and gravity. Friction and gravity need to be balanced in order for an object to continue moving at a constant velocity. The energ.y transferred to an object in either scenario only balances out these external \"forc.es\" allowing it to keep moving at a constant velocity and does not cause a displacement of the object.  It is important for you or anyone to understand everything here before I continue on. However, there is no point in continuing if you or anyone cannot first let go of the erroneous thinking that an external forc.e acting on an object that is moving at a constant velocity causes a displacement of an object. This is a very important point because it establishes the fact that wor.k is not done on an object moving at a constant velocity by an external forc.e and that the energ.y transferred to the object by the external forc.e cannot be used to determine wor.k that is not even done by the external forc.e.
