Some slight oversights here but nothing too weird.  2:01 \"This is just a common conductor that ensures that current always has a path to a large reservoir of charge, usually the Earth itself.\" Ok, and exactly why do we need a grounded connector? Would this short out the battery and not deliver any power to the lightbulb at all since charges always tend to follow the path with the least resistance? What if the negative terminal of the battery had a potential of -100 V? Would current still flow to Earth? Why do most portable appliances not have a ground connector whatsoever, although they do host energy cells? What does this mean?  Crash course, alright, but lacking of proper information has nothing to do with it being fast.

One way to model it is like this.   Picture you have a dam with a full reservoir of water behind it.    If you poke a hole in the dam near the top, it has very little pressure behind it, which is equivalent of low voltage.   The water flows through the hole relatively slowly.    Poke same sized hole in the dam near the bottom and it has great pressure behind it, so the water shoots through the hole in a fast moving stream.     The size of the hole represents resistance where smaller hole = greater resistance.  Given I = V/R, can see that if voltage is increased while resistance remains same, flow rate increases.

The simplest analogy for how this works is that the conductor is like a hollow pipe full of balls.\u00a0 When you push a ball in one end, it forces a different ball out the other end as fast as that pressure can be communicated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For highly conductive metals the pressure can be transmitted closed to the speed of light.\u00a0\u00a0 In less conductive materials as low as half the speed of light.\u00a0\u00a0 But the velocity of the balls themselves is relatively slow except at the kind of voltage pressures you'd use in a super collider (Gigavolts).\u00a0", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "HXOok3mfMLM", "cid": "Ugh-muICertuongCoAEC.8KGlVNmMXM48KHrlO1DyGl", "comment": "Voltage is energy per charge.

She wants to know what would happen to the current if the resistance stays the same but the velocity increases, the only way I could think of explaining it in a simple way is by saying that if the velocity increases, so will the current because if you think about it logically more volts will mean more heat, and the speed (current) has to increase or else the wire will burn out...though I'm not 100% sure if this is true...I'd appreciate some help PLEASE!!
