[{"vid": "jhXCTbFnK8o", "cid": "UgzpEeKEVKDtg-63SR54AaABAg", "comment": "Hey guys, there\u2019s been a ton of news the past week about a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol that protects our Wi-Fi networks, and since we say that AES is secure in this video, we thought it would be helpful to explain how it all relates. In October of 2017, researchers released a viable hack against WPA2, known as KRACK Attack, which uses AES to ensure secure communication between computers and network routers. The problem isn't with AES, which is provably secure, but with the communication protocol between router and computer. In order to set up secure communication, the computer and router have to agree through what's called a \"handshake\".  If this handshake is interrupted in just the right way, an attacker can cause the handshake to fault to an insecure state and reveal critical information which makes the connection insecure. As is often the case with these situations, the problem is with an implementation, not the secure algorithm itself.

Consider it more like Cliff's Notes. It's something that is best served as a supplemental source. At the same time, if you have sufficient backround knowledge, you can still potentially learn quite a lot from this alone. In this case, it really helps to have a strong grasp of mathematics and particularly discrete structures. Without that, then yeah, it's nearly impossible to teach cryptography, a field that took millenia to develop, and comprises an entire semester-long college course on it's own down to 12.5 minutes. Instead, just think of it as an introduction to the concepts that cryptography is forced to worry about. Speaking as someone with a Computer Science degree, and who took Cryptography, and who has spent years doing cryptographic work, I promise you, this information is presented with excellent accuracy and precision. This whole course has been overall _incredible_. I'm used to reading articles from outside sources on things that I actually know about and find at least one glaring flaw, and usually closer to about 2.5 glaring misunderstandings. On CC-CS, their fact-checking has been _excellent_. Mistakes and glaring omissions are nearly non-existent.

Second, the existence of one-way functions is an open problem in computer science.

In October of 2017, researchers released a viable hack against WPA2, known as KRACK Attack, which uses AES to ensure secure communication between computers and network routers. The problem isn't with AES, which is provably secure, but with the communication protocol between router and computer. In order to set up secure communication, the computer and router have to agree through what's called a \"handshake\".  If this handshake is interrupted in just the right way, an attacker can cause the handshake to fault to an insecure state and reveal critical information which makes the connection insecure. As is often the case with these situations, the problem is with an implementation, not the secure algorithm itself.
