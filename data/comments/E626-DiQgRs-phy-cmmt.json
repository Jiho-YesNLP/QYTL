The organizations or groups are being monitored. Remember, it's not yet the time and Days of Tribulation understood. There's 7 years of bountiful grace prior to half of the 7 years of Great Tribulation which is 3 and a half years or 42 months ordered by God to be halved, clear. Signs prior to the Great Tribulation are  Conflicts and Wars Widespread Very strong Earthquakes, Economic Turmoil, Onset of Serious and Chronic Diseases and Famines, Death Widespread, following the effects of Disasters of  the 4 Beasts mentioned in the Scriptures after the Prophet Daniel dream of King Nebuchadnezzar Statue wherein after there's temporary peace in Israel of 7 years peace in the Middle East after the agreements signed and whether that 7 years peace in Israel and their enemies and the 7 years bounty thats the interpretation of the real Bible experts as I only have stated what I can remember scripturally but there's mentioned 7 Seals in the Book of Revelation prior to the dominance of the 2 Witnesses then there's clashes against the False Prophet and the Son of Perdition whether scripturally or by the use of their powers just like the time of Moses with Joshua battling in power the Sorcerer's and Dark practitioners Black magics of the Pharaoh using their pole sticks turned into snakes and their snakes battled  as correlated to that but not as exact such spiritual battles like that could be more about the Light Force Powers versus the Dark Force Powers at works, read the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse for you to tailor the details written, there's also mentioned the later dominance of their later part of the story or show the Son of Perdition and the False Prophet, wherein the Son of Perditioned was wounded and later orchestrated the slaughtering of the followers of the True Religion preaching God's teachings, but again there's the prophecy of the Who is  and is not and who is to come as Christ Imitator have fought the South forces and the North forces rushes to  either Israel or that person mentioned to aid in battle and then set his tent against the North and was irritated by the what's happening in the East which could be the same person the Son of Perdition or the Antiochus or King Nimrod, analyze and tailor events Bible Experts and Bible Scholars because the succession of events were not all written in the Book of Revelation, the others were written in the book of Daniel and the Book of Ezekiel and the book of Kings, as state of the fact written verses and frankly and honestly speaking according to my stock knowledge only as I can remember and analyzed , but when a mentioned amount of Dinario or Dinar which can only purchase some bread only is the start of the Great Tribulation of 42 months or 3 and a half years because an  area was remained after the disaster or onslaught done by the what was written in the 7 Trumphets of strikes from the skies which causes havoc, chaos, disasters, destruction on Earth and it's resources, could be caused by Wars, Extra- Terrestials, or by the 4 Powerful Angels to battle the 200 Million troops on horses could be symbolic or hi tech vehicles, or spiritual horses, or monstrous creatures mounted by creature armies with Nephilim giants, remember there's Armageddon 1 and after the 1,000 years there's Armageddon 2 when the Dragon Devil was released from the Abyss, but prior to the appearance of Christ in Red cloth mounted on a White horse together with his armies and Holy beings of Heaven there are the release of pesky dead creatures eating flesh as was mentioned in verses could be zombies or monsters and there are those battling them prior to the openings of the Skies for the coming of Christ in Warfare, Armageddon 2? Probably because I think it's about spiritual battles of principalities of opposing sides and by their power battles, in Armageddon 1 as I analyzed and tailored things only remember that happened in Old Testament Moses time by powers and in New Testament Christ time battle of the teachings, and that's the version of God's Gospel High Priest  Jesus Christ in simple clothing, Christ other version shall be the Warrior Christ.
