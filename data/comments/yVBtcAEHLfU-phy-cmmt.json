That said, the general idea presented in this video was extremely helpful. Thank you for filling in so many gaps and educating people on this compelling topic. Though I know very little I am very inspired by this quote: \"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.\" - Nikola Tesla A little off topic, I've also taken some interest in the law of vibration. The way cells are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons vibrating in a synchronized dance is truly amazing and it's the speed of these vibrations that determines whether something is a solid, liquid or gas.

When you calculating distance , you can calculate first what intensity will be for 1m with 1m you can easily calculate what intensity will be for 5m , 1.3m . For example intensity of sound from 2 meters is 100w/m2 , following this formula X/4=100 , since it is 2m distance we convert 2 , into 2 squared and that is =4. Then you multiply 100*4=400 W/m2 ,and you have intensity from 1m .Then you do similiar thing with 1.3m distance , 5m distance .For 5m you first calculate the square of 5 which is 25 ,then you divide  1m distance (400) with 25 ,and you get correct answer 400/25=16 , 16W/m2 .Same thing with 1.3m, 400/1,69=236 , 236W/m2.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "yVBtcAEHLfU", "cid": "UgwAe0F9TKSsb5-yYzF4AaABAg", "comment": "46:18 You can also instead of direct calculation by level of intensity, you can also convert level of intensity to intensity then calculate the distance (150m).

Unfortunately, it's also obvious that he's not given so much as one minute of thought at to what he's parroting back from those classes.\r \r This explanation of sound fails at such a cursory and basic level that it's both a crime and a sin that it's allowed to be taught this way in schools. Students deserve better.\r \r This comment will outline just a couple of the many errors in the teaching of sound. For simplicity only sound in air will be considered.\r \r The notion of sound as alternating compressions and rarefactions being \"pushed out\" by a sound source leads to a question that must be asked (but, never is). Why don't those compressions (air particles being pushed closer together) and rarefactions (air particles being...somehow...made to be further apart. Just how not being explained) can persist in the air for at least several seconds, without diffusing and fading out within a few feet at most?\r \r After all, it you create a fairly massive rarefaction by sucking air into your lungs and taking it out of the immediate atmosphere and then making a compression by blowing the air out. How long do those rarefactions and compressions persist when blowing out the candles on a birthday cake? Or blowing out the candles (or at least trying to blow them out) from 5 feet away?\r \r How much compression and rarefaction is there from a vocal cord moving perhaps a few thousandths of an inch for even loud talking or yelling. \r \r How does the sound take off at the speed of sound (standard conditions about 760 mph) when the vocal cords are moving at typically less than one mph? You seem proud to be a math whiz' calculate the speed of something you can fairly easily measure, like the motion of a loudspeaker cone.\r \r You must at least get it that a loud sound from a vocal cord or loudspeaker requires it to move faster than with a soft sound. The 'device' moving a greater distance in the same amount of time for the same pitch or frequency of sound when the sound is louder.\r \r If the sound source is moving at different speeds (both due to loudness but also from harmonic content), why don't the rarefactions and compressions run into each other and muddle up the sound? How is it that even from a considerable distance, sound can retain that harmonic content, making the sound easily recognizable?\r \r Some of these questions were asked in a video I made. But, the purpose of the video was not to teach science but to get permissions from Caltech for use of some of their copyrighted material. You can see the video here:\r \r https://youtu.be/4kTLMiGgnqs\r \r What is the mechanism for the sound taking off at 760 mph from less than a 1 mph emitting surface?\r \r The teaching of sound in school science classes is just one fairy tale after another.\r \r One of those fairy tales is the Decibels. The notion that sound is emitted as energy and thus must follow an inverse square law falloff rate. When, even the most obtuse moron can clearly tell that it doesn't, the mathematical physicist still continues to unmercifully beat that dead horse with the mathematics of logarithms, and coming up with the most ridiculous answers and presenting them with a straight face:\r \r https://youtu.be/R5rkg8mTRBI\r \r I guess my advice would be to actually think this issue of sound through...at least a little bit...before making a 3 1/2 hour video about it.\r \r salaphysics.com\\\r 062720", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "yVBtcAEHLfU", "cid": "Ugy1LOtm0sEzFVQ_BMp4AaABAg", "comment": "Currently watching at 2x speed 2 hours before my exam", "votes": "28", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "yVBtcAEHLfU", "cid": "UgyUZjMXF5a-WOaZAFt4AaABAg", "comment": "thanks sir", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "yVBtcAEHLfU", "cid": "UgwGTf-Fd2gHoTm-Ih54AaABAg", "comment": "Im just curious do you guys read the textbook before watching his videos or not at all?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "yVBtcAEHLfU", "cid": "UgwIQQ16obfQwimw7mN4AaABAg", "comment": "Fantastic!
