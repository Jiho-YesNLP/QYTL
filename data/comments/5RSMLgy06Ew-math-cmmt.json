Other resources probably don't need to be split into two exclusive groups to find stable solutions either.  If you make it so higher weights are better, and allow weights -1 and 0 (values -1 and lower all have the same effect), and make the graph n-node complete, you can run the (nearly) same algorithm and it finds stable pairs without needing to know gender. That is: heterosexuals will never be paired with same-sex partners, homosexuals will never be paired with opposite sex partners, bisexuals will be paired stabily, and people for whom attraction is less important than having any partner at all will potentially get paired with zeros to create stabil pairs, and people who would rather be alone than be paired with a zero, will be alone. Just never pair any resource with something that it weighted at -1.  This could also be expressed with all positive weights and a >threshhold or <threshold which each node could define for itself, which could work much more easily with some data sets. And that all of the edges with a -1 on either side could be pruned before evaluating the graph to increase performance. However, I find -1 to Infitiy to be a very intuitive scale for rating how much you want something. It represent [do not want] vs. [do not care] vs. increasingly more desireable than getting nothing. And that the edges where one side is negative and the other side is very positive could be useful information that should be taken into account, so we really ought to have the idea of a graph where these edges exist in our head and only prune them when needed to save CPU cycles instead of pruning our entire understanding of the problem.  How many other problems could we find better solutiosn for if we stop trying to force them to follow the same pattern as compulsury heterosexual marriage?

The proof is as follows,  On day d+1, the guys who were rejected on day 'd' will visit the balconies of the next best possible mate.  There are only three options for the girls, 1. Reject the new boy B, because her current lover R has higher preference than the new boy B.  2. Accept the boy B, because he is the only proposer of her so far  3. Accept the boy B and reject the previous lover R, because the new boy B is preferred by her.  case (1) will not change the state because girl is not falling for a new guy. So invariance holds  case (2) will add a new matching. The boy B has found his best possible mate so far. So the invariance holds  case (3) will change the currently matched pair. There are only three categories of boys - R, B and everyone else. Everyone else is in optimal pair until now because of P(d). B is in optimal state because he found his best match so far, same case(2). R just stricked off the girl from his list and will remain unpaired at the end of day.
