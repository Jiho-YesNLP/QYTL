So with the information we've been given, and the lack of him clarifying, we've done all we can do.   I think having to find a t value makes this problem more difficult so doing this is very beneficial.  We all makes mistakes.

In case he didnt and made a mistake, then i think we cans till solve the problem. since we are given the distance of .5m you can plug that into the position formula, like you mentioned to solve for t ( time it takes to travel .5m). To solve:  t= cos-1(.5/1.5)/(12.4). Then you can plug in the time you find into the velocity and acceleration equation to solve for their respective values.

Your way of the calculation is right but you calculated the t=(cos^-1(0.5/1.5)/12.4 in degree not in radians. (Calculator settings) In fact, it has to be in radians.
