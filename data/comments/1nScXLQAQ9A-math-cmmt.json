But such a set is a subset of infinitely many Cartesian products AxB. To determine if a relation is reflexive, you need to know which AxB you're talking about. E.g. the set {(x,x)} is a relation from {x} to {x} but also a relation from {x,y} to {x,y}. It is thus reflexive on {x} but not reflexive on {x,y}, so reflexivity is not actually a property of {(x,x)} itself. A better definition is to say that a relation is a triple (A,B,P), where the pair-set P is a subset of AxB. With that definition, it is clear from the relation itself whether it is reflexive or not.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1nScXLQAQ9A", "cid": "UgzaNW_N5t9pHGRnArB4AaABAg", "comment": "I take back everything I said about him.
