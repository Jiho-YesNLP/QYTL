I think you may be confusing CH2Cl2 (in the video) and C2H2Cl2 covered by your professor.  Note that these are not the same compound.  CH2Cl2 has a single carbon which is sp3 hybridized and bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees.  If the Cl atoms were 180 degrees apart, it would be nonpolar, but since they are just 109.5 degrees, it is polar. C2H2Cl2 has 2 carbon atoms that are double bonded to each other.  There are actually 3 possible isomers for this compound: 2 are polar and 1 is nonpolar.  If both Cl atoms are bonded to one carbon and both H atoms to the other, then the molecule will be polar.  The other option is for each carbon to be bonded to 1 Cl and 1 H atom, but there are still two isomers possible, cis and trans.  The cis isomer has the Cl atoms oriented only 60 degrees apart and is still polar.  But the trans isomer has them exactly 180 degrees apart and is nonpolar and I'm guessing that this might be the isomer your professor covered.  Toward the bottom of the page, you can see a comparison of these last two at the following link: https://testbook.com/chemistry/physical-properties-of-alkenes Hope this helps!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "HnLarF8emYU", "cid": "UgzJGD74_sBHPoKieUl4AaABAg.A1kYIoK7b3vA1kbnhIR5gu", "comment": "\u00a0@ChadsPrep\u00a0 my apologies, you\u2019re right.
