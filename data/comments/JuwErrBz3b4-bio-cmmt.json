But when we look to the gel electrophoresis result, isn't dominant the only choice? Because it is obvious that the M'' gene is responsible for the disease, all the sick offsprings have that gene and they got that from their mother. If the disease was recessive the father should have been a carrier, which means he shouls inherit the recessive gene to the offsprings for them to have the disease. This is the only choice, but the sick offsprings was able to get different alleles from their father. A carrier inherit only one type of recessive allele.
