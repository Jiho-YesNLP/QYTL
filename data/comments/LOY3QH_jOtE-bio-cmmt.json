SEXUALITY & TRANSVESTISM:\r \r Regarding SEX, which is considered to be an extremely important part of life by the overwhelming majority of adult humans:\r Sexual intercourse refers to the introduction of a man\u2019s penis into a woman\u2019s vagina.\r Other forms of sexual gratification are termed \u201cforeplay\u201d, and all forms of foreplay are not only acceptable within marriage, but encouraged.\r Although sex can be a wonderful thing, it is a private matter, and has no place in public forums, apart from a health-warning perspective.\r \r Sexual intercourse and foreplay is lawful strictly within MARRIAGE, as defined in the previous chapter, and has three main purposes: most obviously for having children; as a form of recreation (especially for couples who are unable to afford to partake in costly forms of pleasurable hobbies, due to poverty); and for bringing the couple (or in the case of polygamous marriages, however many are present) closer together.\r Whenever any one of the procreative, recreative, or unitive aspects of sex is omitted, sex becomes a selfish, sinful act.\r \r Some reasons for sexual intercourse being UNLAWFUL outside of marriage are as follows:\r \r 1. It often results in UNWANTED progeny. By and large, bastards have been shown to be disadvantaged in every possible way, compared to children born within wedlock, and in virtually every instance, are rife with behavioural problems (especially boys raised by single mothers).\r \r 2. It may spread contagious DISEASES, such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts or human papillomavirus, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, trichomoniasis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (which causes AIDS), as well as other infections that may be sexually transmitted.\r \r 3. It contributes to LONELINESS, particularly in the latter years of life. Sociological studies have demonstrated that, in general, the more sexual partners a person has had, the more difficult it is for that person to commit to a stable, intimate relationship (particularly for women).\r \r 4. It can contribute to sexual ADDICTION and objectification. When one is focused solely on gratifying one\u2019s own libidinous desires, it is easy to see attractive persons as mere objects, whose only reason for being is to satisfy that lust. All kinds of addiction to pleasure are self-destructive.\r \r HOMOSEXUAL acts are legitimate solely within polygamous marriages (as defined in Chapter 27). Read Chapter 12 and the Glossary entry under \u201cslippery slope\u201d, to learn the reason for homosexuality being detrimental to society, and therefore, other homosexual acts being unlawful. Whereas heterosexual unions are normal, natural, and necessary for a prosperous society, homosexuality is abnormal, unnatural, and unnecessary, and is destructive to individuals, to families, to society, and of course, to the very survival of the Homo sapiens species itself!\r \r Leading neuroscientists of the current century have demonstrated that same-sex attraction and gender dysphoria can be attributed to certain parts of the brain being formed similarly to the person\u2019s (biological) gender OPPOSITE. There are other physiological determinants for homosexual attraction, such as genetic and hormonal, and to a far lesser degree, environmental causes. As demonstrated in Chapter 11 of this \u201cFinal Instruction Sheet for Humanity\u201d (\u201cF.I.S.H\u201d), this phenomenon was preordained in eternity, but so too were all unbeneficial traits such as criminality and addictive personality disorders, and does not negate the obvious requirement for society to punish perpetrators of homosexual acts. Again, read Chapter 12 to understand metaethics, applied ethics, and the reason for homosexual unions being objectively evil, by nature.\r \r Of all the concepts put forward in this Holiest of Holy Scriptures, this condemnation of homosexual acts is, perhaps, the teaching that elicits the most vitriolic responses from individuals, because over the past few decades of writing this treatise, homosexuality has become widely accepted within most societies throughout the world, and even glorified in some cases! However, the obvious fact of its pernicious nature MUST be proclaimed, if human society is to endure and prosper. It ought to be emphasized that homosexual acts themselves are unlawful, and not simply being predisposed to same-sex attraction. In other words, homosexual individuals can not be prosecuted simply for being attracted to members of the same gender, but only for engaging in unlawful sexual acts, such as sodomy, just as heterosexuals should not be punished merely for being attracted to members of the opposite sex, but for fornicating with them (that is, engaging in extra-marital sexual activity).\r \r \r A TRANSVESTITE is a person who wears clothing belonging to the opposite gender, and is a criminal offence. This truism should not infer that transvestites ought to be severely punished for their choice of attire, but that they must, at least, be sternly admonished by a superior. When males and females dress similarly, including similar hairstyles, it creates an androgynous, or a homogeneous, population, thereby reducing the pool of available mates for that proportion of society who are \u201calpha\u201d oriented. For example, a genuinely masculine man (especially an alpha male) would never even dream of mating with a woman who wears male clothing, keeps her hair short in length, and/or behaves as a tomboy. Conversely, transvestinal men and men who conduct themselves in an effeminate manner, are utterly unattractive to dainty, feminine women.\r \r Transvestism is culturally specific, meaning, in each culture, males and females have their unique, respective fashions. For instance, in Middle-east Asia, at least in recent centuries before the modern era, both sexes wear long, one-piece garments, yet there is a distinct colour and style differentiation between the robes of each gender. The Indian dhoti and sari are both similar in size and shape, yet worn quite differently and of very different colour. At the time of writing, in most countries of the world, males typically wear pants, slacks, jeans, trousers, or short pants, whilst females wear skirts, saris or dresses (at least they SHOULD do so, but often do not, due mainly to the influence of feminism). Of course, there may be minor exceptions to this rule, such as monastic robes for Western monks, and Panjabi pants for North-Western Indian women. Yet, even in those last two cases, it could be argued that they are not, in fact, exceptions to the rule, since they adhere to the rule of cultural-specificity. Furthermore, both genders must dress modestly in public places, including at swimming pools, at the beach or bathing in rivers.\r \r \r \u201cLet marriage be held in honour among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\u201d\r \u201cLetter to the Hebrews\u201d 13:4, Author Indeterminate.\r \r \r \u201cA woman must not wear men\u2019s clothing, nor should a man dress up in women\u2019s clothing, for anyone who does this is offensive to the LORD your God.\u201d\r \u201cDeuteronomy\u201d 22:5, Yahweh (or to be more accurate, whoever authored the Torah).", "votes": "2", "replies": "5", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LOY3QH_jOtE", "cid": "Ugx60JXb2M4D6pRFgBt4AaABAg", "comment": "pretty fascinating! \ud83e\udd70", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LOY3QH_jOtE", "cid": "UgzdNMglMBCK_U9bhJV4AaABAg", "comment": "Does anyone know how the students responded to the survey about the parfumes at the end, because I didn't get that part?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LOY3QH_jOtE", "cid": "UgzdWKgn77GlVBPs5vZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Does anyone know what book is Robert referring to at 1;07 \"that chaos book\"?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LOY3QH_jOtE", "cid": "UgwoIncRTYuxd9PEJ3F4AaABAg", "comment": "\u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LOY3QH_jOtE", "cid": "UgwAlbD-g78HpJOkmhl4AaABAg", "comment": "His delivery is excellent.

Not always in terms of what is asked, but in terms of what is not asked. \"Why do women have orgasms?\" The problem here is that the assumption is that a male orgasm has to feel pleasurable in order for us to procreate. So the question should be: \"Why does sex feel pleasurable?\" And now the question is a lot easier to answer. In this talk, Sapolsky is talking about arousal increases vaginal secretion which helps sperm reach the egg, which greatly increases the likelihood of procreation. But so does sperm. It also leaves the question \"Why do female orgasms increase the vaginal secretion that increases the likelihood of reproduction?\" The male secretes his stuff, and the female secrete hers. The combination will often produce an offspring. Neither of these rely on it feeling good. The professor dismisses the question about why men have orgasms by saying sperm is way more voluminous with orgasm, but that presupposes that orgasms have to exist for the sperm to be voluminous. This is plainly wrong. This is not a biological necessity at all. It happens to be a fact in humans, but it shouldn't be so easily dismissed. The angler fish male melts into the female, and his body excretes sperm. The orgasm isn't necessary to increase sperm, in general. It just happens to be the case in humans. So why is that?  To make it clear what other options there are: people already want to have babies. They dream about having babies and kids, and romanticize this idea. This is a pure reproductive instinct. That in itself would be enough even if sex hurt. I mean, giving birth hurts like hell, and people still go through it because they want babies. Not because sex is so amazing that it's worth getting split in half. People do it despite this knowledge. They even select for natural birth. There are many species that die horrifically after reproducing, yet they still do it. I would even bet my life that if men's heads exploded if they ever had sex, we'd still do it. And we would sacrifice everything to do it. Just like every other species.  Another option that we for the most part don't experience, but could've been a strong motivating factor, is pain. We avoid injury because it hurts. What if not having sex hurt? And sometimes it actually does. Men's testicles hurt if we do not orgasm often enough. If it hurt ten times worse for everyone, we'd definitely have sex just to soothe the pain. On top of all of this, even with all kinds of sexual replacements (sex toys) people still long for a sexual partner. So pleasure itself doesn't really have such a central part as people think. Obviously, it's a very important factor, but reducing sexual motivation to this is not very intelligent.  That's why \"Why do women have orgasms?\" is a very stupid question, because it forgets almost everything else. If we combine all of the above, we get a much clearer picture. It hurts not to ejaculate; people have an instinctual desire to have children despite all painful downsides and risks of death; people still seek sexual companionship even when sexual pleasure through toys is available; and on top of all that, orgasms motivate sexual reproduction; fluid secretions from either sex significantly increases the chances of reproduction. Women can band together and fight off men despite the dimorphism (as history tells us they have done before), but them being willing is much more productive. We don't have one factor that motivates reproduction, we have many. And each factor increases the likelihood of reproduction.

On the surface, he answered no part of his question, but underneath he had truly answered his question, by telling him that his hypothesis was null and void, and moving on. That's great and all for the fluidity of the video, but I think it's a little too great. I believe this was reflexive, as if every linguistic neuron had been put to work to silence opposition, and having been done quickly, I think this was trained in him (although the answer clearly wasn't, you could hear him stumble over his lingo).  In his Primate's Memoir book, he talks of a recurring dream he has about being surrounded by an angry mob, having to talk his way out of peril, and eventually being able to, where the dream ends. I believe he's one of the many teachers who groom their students into the floppy flippant cynicism that comes with a world void of God. He has a well-meaning facade, in teaching students a new way to employ terminology which other smart people have used for hundreds of years to talk to each other and at laymen.

Well ,my version of the answer is quite different from the explanation he gave,or... the perfume industry use androgenic smells in female parfumes ,because(as Sapolski well explaned in another video lecture) the levels of the testosterone and androgen hormones produced from a young fertile women during sexual arousal are far more higher than in post menopausal women. Means ,men find appealing the smell of women that have a scent of perfume that contains male pheromones that simulates sexual excitement in women. There's nothing to do with the sex gender of their female habitual clients that usually buy the perfumes. The target is not to satisfy the olfactory preferences of the female buyers of perfumes, it is  to  render more interesting their female clients in the eyes(pardon,in the noses) of the opposite sex.

I think when it comes to humans, and how the brain deals with polygamy/polyamory vastly changes between people. Some people are entirely monogamous, whereas others are entirely poly.
