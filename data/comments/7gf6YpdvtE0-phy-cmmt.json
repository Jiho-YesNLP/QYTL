In physics, the word, \u201cForce\u201d as we know it, turns out to be nothing more than an expression to express an idea like one would use the word \u201cLove\u201d to express one's feelings.  But, physics and in mathematics, still use \u201cForce\u201d as thou it were something physical that could enable the initial cause of motion is wrong making it counterintuitive.   History teaches us that change is always constant.  Here is my challenge to anyone.  Without applying the Energy from within you, choose an object of your choices that is in front of you and try pushing and pulling it by simply applying \u201conly\u201d the Force or Net Force.  Remember, no energy.  Meaning that Energy (applied energy) is the origin of motion and not \u201cForce\u201d.  Once Energy (E) is applied, it creates what is known as Momentum (p).  When this Momentum (mass and velocity) comes in contact with another object(s), it makes a surface contact that will enable you to push and pull.  Example:  Ep=ma, Ep=mv and so on.  Note:  Ep is not to be confused as Kinetic Energy in any way.  Momentum represents things like work, wave, gravity, light, lightning, tsunami, earthquake, current, electricity, motion, magnetism, hurricane, etc.  Also note, that it\u2019s \u201cnot\u201d the size of a planet, but the amount of energy (E) being applied from within the planet that creates a strong or weak gravity.  Example:  A black hole the size of a marble can engulf or destroy our sun.   Without Energy, there is no Momentum.  Without Momentum, there is no surface contact on an object(s) to push, pull, work, shaping objects, motion, gravity, etc.  Momentum does not and cannot exist without the applied Energy that creates it.  Energy and Momentum or \u201cEp\u201d is the only common denominator that links all fundamental forces of nature.  Without Ep, all fundamental forces of nature would be inert and non-existence.  Energy is energy, but it\u2019s when Energy (E) is being applied that creates the Momentum (p) making it the initial cause of motion.  Example:  Ep. By applying the right amount of Energy, nothing is immovable or unstoppable.  ~ Guadalupe Guerra", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7gf6YpdvtE0", "cid": "Ugw00sKkPO6Puhu4dgp4AaABAg", "comment": "I believe it is possible that gravity really is a force produced by quantum level particles.

This is scientificly known as the mechanism of GAS BONDING, the process of making solid objects.   (2) Water do not evaporate  !  SUNLIGHT ENERGY at quantum levels splits the water molecules freeing the oxygen hydrogen gases, which rise upwards into the atmosphere to continue it's GAS BONDING cycle, creating a state of solid mass, water ! Which then falls downward as RAINDROPS !!!!!  (3) The spectrum of light is exposed when sunlight photons passes through gases of our atmosphere, which says our moon Mars and others has a different light spectrum if any, this is because of limited atmospheric gases ,with the exception of gaseous planets.   (4) Unlike the mythical Gravity !  Planets orbital motion around the Sun is determined from a physical act of SUNLIGHT PHOTONS ENERGY CONSERVATION, conserving SUNLIGHT PHOTONS at quantum levels in real time, obtaining and mentaining it's orbital motion with needed upgrades to stay locked on to the orbital plain, where the Sun's ENERGY FLOW of PHOTONS is strongest.  (5) There's Space Boundaries out there ! It's the circumference line of a SOLAR SYSTEM ENERGY FLOW, where nothing ever enters or leaves, they're all locked into the orbital plain strong ENERGY FLOW, unable to break away.   (6) - Four reasons why they're wrong about Omauomua.  A - Astronomers didn't see it coming because they were looking away from it's origin , the Sun !  B - Omauomua like many others was tossed out from the Sun for being a hinderance to it's flames smooth ENERGY FLOW, tossed into the far out depths of the solar system where the weak ENERGY FLOW cannot support it with a needed orbit, so here's where UNIVERSAL LAWS steps in, the stronger force overrides the weaker force as the orbital plain strong ENERGY FLOW came calling. Omauomua responded by turning around towards the orbital plain at a level that differs from astronomers point of view, they couldn't see it until it was close up near them, hitting them smack on the nose. C - It's tunbling motion is caused from trying to LOCK onto the orbital plain, trying to get itself an orbit, but was unsuccessfull, same as many others, including comet halley.  D - Omauomua carried no ice because it was newly ejected from the Sun flames.   (7) - Tides changes as in rise and falls when the Earth rotates through its ENERGY connection with the Moon. A high tide when Earth's solid surface faces the Moon , and a low tide when it's pulling on the oceans.  (8) The Sun has no direct influence on the moon , if it did ,it would have an orbit on it's own, out and away from the Earth . The moon, yes , conserves SUNLIGHT PHOTONS ENERGY, but within a single body of energy along with the Earth, to the Sun they're a single sphere, one piece of ENERGY.   (9) Light travel on waves within our gaseous atmosphere. On the moon and Mars where there's limited gas atmosphere there's no light waves.  (10) The Earth conserves less ENERGY when going away from the Sun , which explains two different levels of motion, fast going to the Sun, and slow going away.

If you can't recreate your claim with an experiment then it's nothing but a claim.  So the suns gravity is strong enough to keep all the planets in rotation but not strong enough to put the moon from earth even though it's gravitational pull is 109 times stronger????  So earths gravity keeps all the oceans on a spinning globe but a bumblebee can fly around all day long with its tiny fragile wings and it's massive body???? NONE of these claims can be repeated in an experiment because it's impossible.  So the gravity of earth keeps the moon in rotation but yet the moon passes by earth when it's close and earths gravity pulls the moon back when it's further away.... Another claim that can't be replicated.  If gravity existed and the claim that it keeps the moon in rotation in a giant vacuum then the moon would never get further away from earth..

It's hard to think about extra dimensions, I know right? But I have a strong belief that we have already discovered infact a 4th dimension of space.  And that would be with gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are stretching 3d space and we have detected them! Now how cool is that? Now if you want to stretch a 2d world (aka Flatland) you will need 'higher' dimension in which to do that! That means, that if I want to stretch, twist or bend a 2d plane, I will need a 3rd dimension to do so. And if I am about to stretch, twist and bend our very familiar 3d space, then I can't do it without a 'higher' dimension, in this case, the 4th dimension.  So, I believe that gravitational waves have infact proved with no doubt that the 4th dimension exist, otherwise, how does 3d space bend and stretch? Where will it stretch and bend into? You need the 4th dimension to do so, I believe...  We are also observing gravitational lensing! What that is, is that far away galaxies appear to be 'distorted' when we try to photograph them, when they are 'behind' (from our perspective) a big gravitational field. That proves Einstein correct. That proves that light can be bend when there is a strong gravitational pull and the only way for that to happen is for our 3d space to be severely bend. But where is it going to bend into? Not into itself of course! You need a 4th dimension of space to bend it in. Thus, proving again that the 4th dimension of space exists and it is very real.  Gravitational waves and Gravitational lensing are some of the undeniable 'hints' that there are more than 3 dimensions of space. Now, is time a dimension of space? We don't know yet. There could be 2 scenario's (so far at least)  1) Time is infact a dimension of space and our universe is fully deterministic. (that would also mean that we need to find a way to understand Quantum Mechanics where things are far from determined)  2) Time is not a dimension of space but something really, radically different. In that case, our world could very well be fuzzy and not definite (at least not in the quantum world). If that's true, when we talk about \"spacetime\" we should say this. \"Spacetime has 4 dimensions of space and Time which is not a dimension of space but something different\"  At least that's my point of view :P", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7gf6YpdvtE0", "cid": "Ugjrxzr4LtHSnXgCoAEC.8E426Y8Ov998E5df9l4UKu", "comment": "+Sylorinnis  Would you care to explain why you think you need fourier analysis for either Maxwell's equations or quantum physics ?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7gf6YpdvtE0", "cid": "Ugjrxzr4LtHSnXgCoAEC.8E426Y8Ov998E5hrvlLbWF", "comment": "Sylorinnis We didn't do any Fourier transformation in quantum mechanics.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7gf6YpdvtE0", "cid": "Ugjrxzr4LtHSnXgCoAEC.8E426Y8Ov998E5jOS0yWEL", "comment": "Sylorinnis No it just says, that you can do QM without it.

In Relativity, matter tells space how to bend and space tells matter how to move. 2.) Newton thought that time was unchanging regardless of the reference point. Again, this view is wrong. Time is the fourth dimension in spacetime and can speed up and slow down. Newton did not understand this and his assumption of the consistency of time is wrong. 3.) Newton thought that gravity was a mysterious force that pulled all matter together again was wrong! Rather as Einstein showed, gravity is nothing more than the curvature of spacetime. 4.)

Obviously is Newton wrong, just like GRT is. That is because EVERY theory is in principle wrong. You are obviously naive enough to believe that GRT is \"true\" and really describes reality and that what we feel to be gravity is truly due to the bending of space time. GRT is a theory, meaning that it is currently the best explanation we have for explaining and predicting several observable behaviors in nature. And it indeed does a fairly good job at it, no doubt, but that doesn't mean it's \"true\". It's simply valid until the next, better theory comes along- Same as before: Newtonian gravity did (and does) a fantastic job, but was succeeded by GRT, because later manages to explain certain facts (of which you correctly mentioned some), that Newtonian gravity didn't. Doesn't mean that the first was wrong and the second is true. The same thing will happen again. It's just a matter of time.

If you are an engineer, I'll try to explain it to you in a way, so that you should be able to understand it: A scientific theory is not reality it's a mental man-made construct for describing reality while trying to make sense of it and making predictions, which can be used to falsify it. Therefore no model is true, neither Newton, nor GRT nor QM. The bending of space time is such a mental construct. You need to learn to not confuse a model with reality. E,g, QED predicts the magnetic momentum of the electron correctly up to the 12th decimal figure and is the most accurate theory mankind has. Does this mean, that it is \"true\". Certainly not (which becomes obvious, when you try use it to predict the magnetic momentum of the muon). A scientist never mistakes his model for reality. The same is true for GRT. Space time is not truly bent, It is just a mathematical model to describe the physical effects we observe in a consistent way. Works excelent, but doesn't mean that it is true. If it would be \"true\", why does it lead to singularities when calculating the centers of black holes ? There are no infinities and therefore singularities in physical reality. Singularities just pop up in formulas when a theory is being applied to situations when the model is\u00a0 beyond its boundaries and therefore no longer valid. You don't have a scientific education, so I can sort of understand that you truly believe that every scientific theory is true, because that's what you were told. But if this would be true, no theory could ever be substituted with a better one. Because how could you substitute the \"truth\" with something even better ? That's obviously logically impossible. In practice is no theory true and should never be mistaken for reality. It's just the currently best way we have for describing reality. If you want to understand this, I'd suggest you make yourself familiar with the theory of science and how theories are in principle developed, falsified and substituted and what they truly are.
