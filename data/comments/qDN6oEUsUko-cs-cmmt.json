Now let's define \"inner\" and \"outer\" cables for one node.  Number of Outer cables is always equal to 2, in order to have mesh network.  OC=2 Number of Inner Cables is: IC= P/N - OC = P/N - 2 = 5-2 = 3  Total number of Outer cables is equal to the number of Nodes  TOC = N = 6 Total number of Inner cables is: TIC = IC*N / 2 = 3*6 / 2 = 9 (dividing by 2, because if one node is connected to other node, then there is no need for another cable to make connection again between these two nodes, it's a bidirectional network).   Sum of TOC and TIC is the number of total number of cables, TC TC = TOC +  TIC = 9+6 = 15  If we divide TP (num. of total ports) we'll get exactly the same result 30/2 = 15, and it makes sense, because it's a bidirectional network, to connect two nodes we need only one cable.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "Ugy1wdRg6rPz-E6cjIR4AaABAg.919twiSnbIH9MP7Y_BInKm", "comment": "\u00a0@opst1704\u00a0 Thank you so much for amazing explanation \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "Ugzp44yl4o1wzBVqqv94AaABAg", "comment": "1. 15 2 . 5 3. 30", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "Ugz4iugCU84r5FdAVDx4AaABAg", "comment": "When are you releasing the NESO academy app ?", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "UgwTZJj22ff-Xgbsmk54AaABAg", "comment": "Sir makaut university(west bengal)  semester is going to start from 1st week of december, could you please upload the whole videos as soon as possible......please we need your help #nesoacademy #nesoacademy", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "UgyvPcAz8dyPfta201Z4AaABAg", "comment": "(i) 15 (ii) 5 (iii) 30", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "UgxT5lnkCPzNTdtgx1h4AaABAg", "comment": "How Will be total 4 ports??", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "UgycnBuXGXNcYRintmd4AaABAg", "comment": "I was waiting for problem Thank you!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "UgxsJWyi3BA4XoTjMYd4AaABAg", "comment": "Tq for tiz one...\ud83d\udd25", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qDN6oEUsUko", "cid": "Ugz4iugCU84r5FdAVDx4AaABAg.919pVTx6xVE91BzJbOIyKN", "comment": "\u00a0@nesoacademy\u00a0 Thank you Sir.
