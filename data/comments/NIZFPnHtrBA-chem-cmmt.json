ElectroNegativity     - Linus Pauling --> proposed the ideas of it. (Prof. J. Grossman talks about it @L09 of 5.111 2018ed)     - Here, Prof. Catherine @01:00 --> focuses more on the Ideas of DR. ROBERT. S. MULLIKEN (1896-1986)     - \ud835\udf4c = \u00bd( IE + EA )      - I had a Super Hard time understanding it, Because Prof: Cathy never talked about it enough before throwing off that Clicker question. >_< I think it's because prof. Cathy was expecting students to be able to tackle the Clicker Question using the Equation that she showed on the Board. But I had very strong doubt about it & I was denying that equation from the insides of my body & mind. I had to go check out the Lectures by Prof. J. Grossman over @5.111 OCW-2018. That helped me understand it properly  & Also this article:- https://lavelle.chem.ucla.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?t=81989#p363278  :cat-orange-whistling:      - Why should we care about Electro-Negativity @06:55       - Honestly, IMO, The example shown about this is really Bad.... It hardly gets you to understand \"WHY ELECTRO-NEGATIVITY?\", & Why not Electron-Affinity? :shrugg: :face-blue-wide-eyes:I think they produced such video anyway, because they really couldn't find any real world example of where to actually talk about this goddamn confusing Electro-Negativity term which from the dawn of time should have been called \"Electron-Tight-enity\" [refer to the ucla Link that I put above.]        - They weren't at all talking about Electro-Negativity. They were just casually discussing usage of HALOGENs.... & That, good people, can also be understood just as fine using the idea of Electron Affinity & Ionization energy alone. & I got confused in the process, Thinking that I am dumb >_<    2. Atomic Radi-i @13:55, Ionic Radii @17:00 Iso-Electronic Atoms @23:00     - 90% of Probability Cloud (a.k.a Electron Density) is inside that Radius :cat-orange-whistling:     - \ud835\udc5f \u221d \ud835\udc5b\u00b2     - \ud835\udc5f \u221d 1/\ud835\udcb5     - \ud835\udc5f = radius     - BUT     - E \u221d \ud835\udcb5\u00b2/\ud835\udc5b\u00b2       [top/bottom is swapped now]    THE DOGS @27:11         &       \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5f \ud835\udd3b\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd63 \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5c\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd68\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd6a           BONDing = the thing between 2 Atoms & 2 atoms only       [SideNote By REY]     Molecule = Made-up of 1Bond or More :cat-orange-whistling:                             [SideNote By REY]  3. Ionic Bonds @29:30     - Catherine shows How can know if a Ionic Bond will form.... >_< :cat-orange-whistling:     - Coulombic Attraction between Ionic Atoms @33:25 4. Covalend Bonds (intro) @38:30 ===> Polar-Covalent Bond (the Idea) @46:30     - The GRAPH:- Distance v/s PE(IonicBond) @00:32  ==== \"The Diagram of Attraction & Repulsion\" ===+> It is better explained by Prof. Jeff. Grossman @L07 ending + L08 of 5.111 (2018 OCW)     - DISSOCIATION ENERGY a.k.a BOND STRENGTH ====> @42:10       - Which molecule has Stronger Bond? ====> @44:00  5. How many Bonds can an ELEMENT Make?     ====> Varies as per ELEMENT ====> Discussed in the next video in my KHEMEIA P2 playlist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0Qaf-UJ2XQ) 6. How the fuck does Molecules (with multiple Bonds) Look? In realiaty? Can we capture them with ElectronMicroscope? ====> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0Qaf-UJ2XQ) 7. What the fuck are Molecular Vibrations? In Reality? Can you Picture them in your mind? How does scientists think of it? ====> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0Qaf-UJ2XQ)     - All the Usage:- Also discussed in that video :cat-orange-whistling:", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "NIZFPnHtrBA", "cid": "UgxDYb_wGPxeUxSzm_l4AaABAg", "comment": "When she says that high electronegativity is due to high IE.
