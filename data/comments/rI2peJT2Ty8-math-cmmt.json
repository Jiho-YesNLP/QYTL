At school I enjoy sport and art because when i\u2019m in my sport lesson i have a lot o fun playing the games and doing the exercises, I like when it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday and they  bring in food for me to eat, I also like having fun with our class. But it\u2019s also important to get work done, I think it\u2019s important to have a good relationship with my teacher. My favorite food is chicken sandwich it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m really bad at maths so I want to learn more maths because i\u2019m SO bad. My favourite animal is a dog, I have a dog his name is romeo he is turning six this year.
