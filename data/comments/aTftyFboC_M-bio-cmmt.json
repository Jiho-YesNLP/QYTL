The most absurd pile of crap in the bible. 1. The most common date given for the flood is 4400 years ago, right in the middle of the Egyptians first burst of city and temple building, why did they not notice they were under water?\r  2. To flood the planet to over top the highest mountain you would need about 3 to 4 times the known amount of water in the world, where did all that water come from? \r 3. After the flood, where did the water go? \r 4. How did 8 people build a wooden ship bigger than any wooden ship built in modern times when THAT ship was reinforced with steel bracing and still broke up and sank. \r 5. How did animals with odd diets get to the ark? \r 6. How did 8 people deal with the needs of 10000 animals on the ark? Each animal had to be fed, watered, exercised and the poop scooped. Working 12 hours a day they would need to deal with over 100 animals per hour. \r 7. How did the animals get back to the four corners of the world when all plant life had been killed off by the flood? \r 8. If there were 10000 animals on the ark representing about 4000 species, and there is now about 8.7 million species on Earth, each species surviving the flood would have to generate 217 new species in the 4400 years since the flood.\r 9. Well according to the Book of Jasher, the wives ARE sisters. Jasher 5: 32-35 \"And thou shalt choose for thy sons three maidens, from the daughters of men, and they shall be wives to thy sons. And Noah rose up, and he made the ark, in the place where God had commanded him, and Noah did as God had ordered him. In his five hundred and ninety-fifth year Noah commenced to make the ark, and he made the ark in five years, as the Lord had commanded. Then Noah took the three daughters of Eliakim, son of Methuselah, for wives for his sons, as the Lord had commanded Noah.\" If a species undergoes a population bottleneck, the lack of genetic diversity can be seen in the members of that species. NO such bottle neck exists in the overwhelming majority of species. \r 10. 4400 years is not a long enough time to generate the diversity in the human population to give rise to the different populations of people we see on the planet especially when you consider that effectively the genetic diversity was limited to 4 people, Noah and his wife and Eliakim and his wife. \r 11. Ken Ham's phony Ark has a million Dollar + heating, ventilation and air conditioning system that ensures that workers and visitors do not suffocate in the building. According to the bible, the original Ark had one window, 18 in square. Sorry people but if Ham's estimate of 1600 species represented by a minimum of 4000 animals, they would have suffocated.\r     ~ Those who claim The Bible has contradictions simply need help reading/interpreting it.   <BULLSHIT.  Matthew 27:5\u20138 5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. 6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, \u201cIt is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.\u201d 7 So they took counsel and bought with them the potter\u2019s field as a burial place for strangers. 8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood ito this day. \r Acts 1:18\u201319 18 (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)\r        Would you elaborate on the \"poor science    <You cannot breed striped cattle by servicing the cow beside a striped wall.

It had a bone in it's inner ear called an \"involucrum\" that resembled something found in whales. It was fully terrestrial (lived it's entire life on land) and looked nothing like a whale but neo-Darwinist, desperate for a whale ancestor, tagged it Pakicetus or \"Pakistani whale\".  Ambulocetus, Maiacetus, Kuchicetus and Rodhocetus were extinct variations of sea lions or otters. They were amphibious (lived part of their lives on land and part in the water). They used their hind legs and tail for swimming and their four limbs for walking on land.  Basilosaurus and Dorudon were extinct whales that were fully aquatic ( lived their entire lives in the water). Land and amphibious mammals have nostrils for breathing on the front of their heads.  Whales have a blowhole on the top of their bodies to breath. The blowhole of a whale is surrounded by thick muscular \u201clips\u201d that keep the hole tightly closed except when the animal makes a deliberate effort to open it at the surface. Total submersion thus takes less effort for whales than for animals that must actively exclude water from their air passages. Coming onto land is not a natural act for a whale; beached whales die if they're not quickly helped back in the water. Land and amphibious mammals use four legs\u2014tail assisted for amphibians while in water\u2014to move around in their environment.  Whales use a fluke to move around in their environment. Land and amphibian mammals can survive without the tip of their tail. Whales can't survive without it. Flukes are flat horizontal lobes at the ends of their tails. Fluke movements are coordinated by a complex system of long, powerful tendons connecting them to specialized muscles in the tail. These are a few of the myriad of changes they would have to undergo. For neo-Darwinist it would take hundreds of millions of random mutations (random variations for traditional Darwinist), to compel a fully terrestrial mammal to turn into a fully aquatic mammal.   The biggest problem for the \"walking whales\" is the empirical evidence--Darwinist refuse to acknowledge--not found in the fossil record. It's all but complete. Paleontologist have not discovered the fossils of innumerable transitional intermediate mammals, falling between and linking Pakicetus and whales.  All the natural history museums in the world should be overflowing with them. With enough imagination anyone can invent a story about how land mammals evolved into whales.

Wolves and Dogs are descended from common ancestors (which looked more like modern wolfs than dogs). Over many generations, Humans selected the \u201cfavourable\u201d traits (e.g., long shiny fur, or stocky legs etc) to produce the many different types / breeds of modern dogs that we have today. The keyword here is \u201cover many generations\u201d. There are modern dogs that, of course, are still very much wolve-like in appearance (e.g., Huskies, German Shepherd etc). Some dog breeds are much less wolf-like in appearance (Chihuahua, Shih Tzu etc) as they have been artificially selected for their small size and \u201ccute\u201d traits. So why is it known as artificial selection? This is because the Human (the dog breeders) are the ones determining which individual dogs they would prefer to produce offsprings, thereby continuing the genes they would like to retain. Prior to this, it is also important to understand the idea of Variation. This means that in a litter of puppies, not every puppy is physically identical (even though they may look identical to the untrained eyes). Some puppies have slightly longer legs, some shorter legs. Very small differences, but, yes, the differences are there. It is due to this physical variations that the breeders (humans) select which dogs possess the traits he wants, thus the term \u201cArtificial Selection\u201d. This Selection process is repeated over many generations and the result is the modern dog breeds we have today.  Once we understood Artificial Selection, it will be easy to understand Natural Selection. In Natural Selection, the environment aka Mother Nature (instead of Human) is the factor deciding which traits survive through the generations. How? One example is Food Source. Many species of birds have developed the ability to swim to obtain their food (Adaptability). One pre-requisite of aquatic birds is having water-proof feathers. In this case, this is the \u201cFavourable Trait\u201d. One group of birds may live nearer to the seasides and Individual birds with better waterproof feathers is seen by Mother Nature as a \u201cfavourable trait\u201d. And so individual birds with this trait has a much higher chance of survival and passing on this gene to the next generations. Birds with \u201cless waterproof\u201d feathers may probably not even live to adulthood as they had difficulties obtaining their food (in the sea), resulting in their genes being eliminated from this group of birds. Using an analogy, you may think of this  process as a kind of filtration process, where only the finest particles is able to pass through the fine filter. This is Adaptation, and it has to be highlighted that Adaptation takes place over many, many, many generations. Physical Adaptations (e.g., change in body shapes) DO NOT take place in just one generation. In other words, an individual animal will not change its form physically to obtain that trait in its lifetime, unless it\u2019s metamorphosis which is a totally different thing.  We also observed this in rabbits living in deserts and rabbits living in cold countries. The long ears in rabbits act as effective heat radiators. This enables the rabbits to lose body heat efficiently, just as how humans lose heat efficiently by sweating. The rabbits living in deserts adapted (over many generations) to the environment by developing very long and erect ears for highly efficient lowering of their body temperature. But rabbits living in cold countries tends to have shorter ears (some even have lop ears). Shorter ears is the \u201cfavourable trait\u201d here as it enables them to lose less body heat. All animals (and yes, that includes Humans) are still in the midst of Evolution. If Evolution is constantly ongoing, why can\u2019t we see it happening? We need to understand that Evolution is a very, very slow on-going process. Evolution will never be \u201ccomplete\u201d, as change is the only constant. If Evolution is true, why are there no animals that are \u201cneither here nor there\u201d (i.e., in-between two species)? We need to remember humans are the ones who gave distinct names to different distinct species of animals in the first place. Let us look at the Seals / Walruses. Their ancestors are land animals, but their body shapes (flippers and hydrodynamic bodies) are hard evidence that they are in the midst of \u201ctransition\u201d from land animals to aquatic animals, as their main source of food is in the sea.

In particular an Anglo saxon religion. It has been called a religion by Karl popper and other atheist philosophers of science.  Natural selection can't be falsified and when it has, an ad hoc explanation is always given. Like I mentioned earlier it has been challenged by other alternative mechanisms that were developed by atheist evolutionary biologists.  Homology has never been proven. It's an assumption. It's circular reasoning. There are similarities between humans and apes because of common ancestor. There is a common ancestor of humans and apes because of similarities. This is the premise of homology. There is no paleontologists who would disagree with the fact that there are 4 assumptions when looking at fossils, the first is naturalism. Which basically means everything has to be explained naturalisticly. That's why Darwin and other atheist evolutionary biologists said if there are no fossils, human and chimp ancestry will still be true. It's because of the assumption of naturalism.

However, high degrees of certainty can be reached. In the case of evolution, we have huge amounts of data from diverse fields. Extensive evidence exists in all of the following different forms. Each new piece of evidence tests the rest. All life shows a fundamental unity in the mechanisms of replication, heritability, catalysis, and metabolism. Common descent predicts a nested hierarchy pattern, or groups within groups. We see just such an arrangement in a unique, consistent, well-defined hierarchy, the so-called tree of life. Different lines of evidence give the same arrangement of the tree of life. We get essentially the same results whether we look at morphological, biochemical, or genetic traits. Fossil animals fit in the same tree of life. We find several cases of transitional forms in the fossil record. The fossils appear in a chronological order, showing change consistent with common descent over hundreds of millions of years and inconsistent with sudden creation. Many organisms show rudimentary, vestigial characters, such as sightless eyes or wings useless for flight. Atavisms sometimes occur. An atavism is the reappearance of a character present in a distant ancestor but lost in the organism's immediate ancestors. We only see atavisms consistent with organisms' evolutionary histories. Ontogeny (embryology and developmental biology) gives information about the historical pathway of an organism's evolution. For example, as embryos whales and many snakes develop hind limbs that are reabsorbed before birth. The distribution of species is consistent with their evolutionary history. For example, marsupials are mostly limited to Australia, and the exceptions are explained by continental drift. Remote islands often have species groups that are highly diverse in habits and general appearance but closely related genetically. Squirrel diversity coincides with tectonic and sea level changes. Such consistency still holds when the distribution of fossil species is included. Evolution predicts that new structures are adapted from other structures that already exist, and thus similarity in structures should reflect evolutionary history rather than function. We see this frequently. For example, human hands, bat wings, horse legs, whale flippers, and mole forelimbs all have similar bone structure despite their different functions. The same principle applies on a molecular level. Humans share a large percentage of their genes, probably more than 70 percent, with a fruit fly or a nematode worm. When two organisms evolve the same function independently, different structures are often recruited. For example, wings of birds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects all have different structures. Gliding has been implemented in many additional ways. Again, this applies on a molecular level, too. The constraints of evolutionary history sometimes lead to suboptimal structures and functions. For example, the human throat and respiratory system make it impossible to breathe and swallow at the same time and make us susceptible to choking. Suboptimality appears also on the molecular level. For example, much DNA is nonfunctional. Some nonfunctional DNA, such as certain transposons, pseudogenes, and endogenous viruses, show a pattern of inheritance indicating common ancestry. Speciation has been observed. The day-to-day aspects of evolution -- heritable genetic change, morphological variation and change, functional change, and natural selection -- are seen to occur at rates consistent with common descent.  Furthermore, the different lines of evidence are consistent; they all point to the same big picture. For example, evidence from gene duplications in the yeast genome shows that its ability to ferment glucose evolved about eighty million years ago. Fossil evidence shows that fermentable fruits became prominent about the same time. Genetic evidence for major change around that time also is found in fruiting plants and fruit flies   The evidence is extensive and consistent, and it points unambiguously to evolution, including common descent, change over time, and adaptation influenced by natural selection.

Darwin's \"tree of life\" rendering and the factual fossil records are in direct opposition to each other.  I have studied the fossil records in great detail.  Darwin predicted a \"cone of increasing diversity\" with the first living organism gradually and continually diversified to create higher levels of taxonomic order.  The factual fossil records resemble such a cone turned upside down with living things present at the start then decreasing with not one transitional form falling between any two species.

Just because you dont understand evolution doesnt change that they were no longer able to interbreed. You are expecting a big change where there is none.

Nature gives variation and humans or enviornmental pressures selects. All these breeds of dogs came from around 10,000 to 20,000 years of selective breeding, if you dont think bigger changes can happen in millions of years thats just a failure of your imagination. Do you think grizzly bears and polar bears are the same species? What about lions, leopards, tigers, and jaguars? The similarities within groups are a direct result of their common ancestry. For example, all mammals give birth to live young, have fur, nipples, warm blooded and take care of their young, why? Because all mammals descended a comman ancestor that shared all those traits. If all tetrapods share a common ansector, we should expect to see the same  basic anatomy, and thats exactly what we see, same basic bone structures reshaped, check out comparative anatomy.

However, natural selection actually works in the opposite direction of what molecules-to-man evolution requires. It selects from already-existing genetic information, and cannot generate new genetic information.  God created the original animal kinds with much diversity in their DNA, so that as they reproduced and filled the earth, their descendants were able to adapt to many different environments. Scientists have observed this\u2014animals reproduce \u201cafter their kind\u201d (dogs have puppies, cats have kittens, geese have goslings, kangaroos have joeys, etc.). The genetic makeup of some members of a kind is more suitable to certain environments. Natural selection is the process by which animals die out when they don\u2019t have the genetic makeup that allows them to survive in their environment.  Those animals that survive reproduce more animals like themselves. For example, many animals that live in drier regions of the world are able to gain most of the water they need from the plants they eat. Animals without this ability would have a harder time trying to survive in that region, and would eventually die out.

One strategy like rape doesn&#39;t work in all species, specifically due to the way they raise their young. Like ducks is famous for rape behavior, and only the female gets to care for the young. And can be sometimes even worse in species to which no parent care for the young. Their strategy is to make so many kids as possible thus making the changes that a few of them survive more likely.  In mos most mammals, especially primates, the parents only produce few if not only one young at a time and both parents play a role in raising the child, increasing the change of survival not by producing more children, but by raising a few and taking care of them at childhood to adolescence.  The reason why rape isn&#39;t a common theme in mammals is because ovulation (when it is the best opportunity to pass on your genes) occurs not in all females in one time of the year or at steady cycles. Human females are only fertile in a few day period per month. So when a man rapes a women, changes are that the women isn&#39;t ovulating. So the rape strategy only works when the females of the species are all ovulating at one time and you can clearly see when they are ovulating. Ducks ovulate during spring, so rape would work since the chance of of having kids when having sex at that time is high.   In humans this clearly doesn&#39;t work. People with rape strategy need to rape quite often to get any kids and females only produce normally one child at a time, whereas when duck rape multiple partners they can have as 12 times as many offspring, so rape isn&#39;t as productive in species like humans.&#160; so the best way to get a women pregnant is to form a social bond with her and have lots of consensual unprotected sex and help raising the kids. Although despite that this is the better strategy, people still rape and this is due to the fact that humans often don&#39;t have sex for the reason of having kids, but it just feels fantastic, just like people don&#39;t want to get fat but eating gives lots of dopamine.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "aTftyFboC_M", "cid": "UghDA-rYNJmbSXgCoAEC.88Rn_ZD8eR78C8qicDmaPr", "comment": "+Kira1Lawliet My biology teacher discussed this topic with us today in class.

Breeding dogs for 375 generations is a thing you can actually do but humans take far too long to reach reproductive age for that to be practical.  Normally a human generation is considered 24 years; this is when female fertility reaches its peak. There's a bit of debate surrounding when women first become fertile, obviously if you're selectively breeding people you probably won't having any issues with a little child experimentation to find out how low you can go, but at 20 years of age the chance of chromosomal abnormality is 1/500 so I dare not go any lower than that (also the only data I could find on the subject doesn't deal with people under 20 because of obvious reasons).  If we assume that our breeding program has a stock that breeds as soon as the females reach reproductive age (in this case: 20) then finding the amount of time it'd take to breed that level of verification described in your isolated human populations. 375 generations x 20 years per generation = 7,500 years Basically we're looking at a breeding program you'd have to start as soon as copper smelting was invented and 1,000 years before the first mummy.
