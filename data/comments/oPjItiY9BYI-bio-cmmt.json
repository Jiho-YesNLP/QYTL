Can the start site be present on the template strand as well? if the start site is on the template strand shouldn't that be the coding strand? In 29:21 the start site is on the coding strand whereas in 38:22 the start site is on the template strand.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oPjItiY9BYI", "cid": "Ugx3n28aQsuF_5YrFQ94AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oPjItiY9BYI", "cid": "UgxPVrUOdr-Jw6y8U4t4AaABAg", "comment": "Hello\ud83d\udc4b", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oPjItiY9BYI", "cid": "Ugy5zEkPMDtgWfENNbN4AaABAg.9wbIYpRfaH79wku1vf_GBl", "comment": "Each strand can be the template strand. Only one strand serves as a template for transcription of a particular gene. However, there can be different genes present on either strand so transcription can take place along the chromosomes in both directions. What determines the direction of the gene is the orientation of the start sequences and the operator regions.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "oPjItiY9BYI", "cid": "Ugx3n28aQsuF_5YrFQ94AaABAg.9qEmTBUHQt29sOsTCXFjA0", "comment": "You're welcome", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
