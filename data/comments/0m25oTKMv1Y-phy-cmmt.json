And continuing on that theme...  ----------------------  Electrical engineers commonly know root mean square (rms) as the area under a sine wave as graphically depicted.   For someone who is satisfied with some sort of mathematical result without much concern or interest of the mechanism for it, the calculations in the video are probably...good enough.  But, the mathematical answer doesn't make sense. Yes, it can be shown that air is mostly nitrogen and even as N<sub>2</sub>. And, yes, there is math that can come up with a number that is said to represent the speed of that particle (molecule). And, that speed comes out to about 500 m/s at standard temperature.  I don't think YouTube comments allow HTML tags but, if you know aa little about HTML, you'll recognize the <sub></sub> tags...for whatever that's worth.  ----------------------  We can pretty easily measure the speed of sound these days, using a variety of methods, and find that the speed of sound is about 340 m/s. And, sound travels through the air which is mostly nitrogen.  The question is: If sound is traveling about 68% as fast as the nitrogen particles, what significant change in their interaction happens between when an object is traveling subsonically (at perhaps 65%) and supersonically (at perhaps 70%)/?  There's three possible answers. 1) the right one. 2) the wrong one and 3) the \"I neither know or care\" one. it's most likely that both you and the author of the video will say it's #3.

But, the speed of the gas particles at any specified temperature does have an impact.  \r Just looking at the mathematically derived answers you can see that only the temperature is shown (once the gas(es) has/have been determined.\r \r This is a tricky subject as the whole concept of sound is so poorly understood by, unfortunately, arrogant mathematicians who cannot conceive of being wrong about...anything. Even when (especially when) they are wrong.\r \r But, since this video is on the speed of nitrogen particles as N2, let's stick with that for now.\r \r The presenter immediatley launches into some mathematics that he memorized while taking some physics class and assumes the result to be as it was told to him to be so. And, anyone who does that math will end up with the same numbers he does.\r \r You mentioned the speed of sound.\r \r Thee are a number of issues that need to be addressed and sorted out. Here's one: In the mixture of gasses that is the air (mostly nigrogen as N2) it is said that the speed of air particles is about 500 m/s (meters per second, about 1100 mph). But, the speed of sound thoufh the air, at the same temperature is about 340 m/s or 760 mph. Somehow we need to come up with a cogent explanation of how sound can travel through air particles traveling at about 1100 mph when sound is traveling through the air at 760 mph.\r \r Figuring that out is a big step in getting the core concept of sound right.\r \r It's interesting that well over 100 years ago (in the 1880s) people were questioning the explanation of the mathematical physicists regarding the nature of sound. This link is to a Scientific American supplement of a lecture published at that time on this very subject:\r \r https://chestofbooks.com/crafts/scientific-american/sup3/The-Fallacy-Of-The-Present-Theory-Of-Sound.html\r \r They knew that there was something different between air with sound and air without sound and they guessed it was some sort of \"agitation of the air\". Not a bad guess but, an incorrect one. But, certainly no more wrong than anything you can see or read these days on the subject.\r \r Keep in mind that this was before the age of electronics and even the Edison grammophone was still in it's early stages of being developed. A time when accurate measurements of high-speed events (like sound) could not be easily made like they are now. So, they had an excuse for getting it wrong. We (plural \"we\") can't use that excuse.\r \r And, there is a LOT more to say about this but, I don't want to go into information overload so will stop here.\r \r salaphysics.com\r 110920", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "0m25oTKMv1Y", "cid": "Ugwa3b0nlINwO7yKXA94AaABAg", "comment": "didn't get the 1st one", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0m25oTKMv1Y", "cid": "UgwjOEnR4Qqr2P8n-LF4AaABAg", "comment": "I don't get this one", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0m25oTKMv1Y", "cid": "Ugyk0Kjy-J9W2ooPwB94AaABAg", "comment": "Would u please post a video lecture on Maxwell Bolzmann Distribution of Molecular speeds", "votes": "18", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0m25oTKMv1Y", "cid": "UgxOSd23E4ItPMu8qUt4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you!!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0m25oTKMv1Y", "cid": "UgzmI4X5oJDbc3MH4Rp4AaABAg", "comment": "Nice", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "0m25oTKMv1Y", "cid": "Ugwa3b0nlINwO7yKXA94AaABAg.92O0wHo7F-a93OAhCHV595", "comment": "You need to watch the 2 hour gases video ...
