I thought I would try and learn to do it in a more current language. Granted I have to get through this 6.0001 course first so I can get to 6.0002 where I need to be for database programming.  I'm just hoping to learn something I didn't know. So far it's just refresher, which is fine. I already know pretty much everything being discussed.

Basically a way of saying the value returned is \"good enough\" although  not truly accurate.  PI = 3.14159 is \"good enough\" albeit not correct for the value of half the circumference of a unit circle.  You can use an EPSILON value to change what your threshold is of what you consider \"good enough\"  Hope someone else reads this and can elaborate or correct", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "SE4P7IVCunE", "cid": "Ugg_y8Ig15dDdngCoAEC.8UlzFDb0a1v8amL7BhqCtx", "comment": "It also is used in Calc : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(\u03b5,_\u03b4)-definition_of_limit and actually here's a pdf with notation explanations: http://www.unm.edu/~ckbutler/ps541/MathNotation.pdf", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "SE4P7IVCunE", "cid": "Ugg_y8Ig15dDdngCoAEC.8UlzFDb0a1v8dLKcaitUSr", "comment": "a kind of quantization error, in my opinion", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "SE4P7IVCunE", "cid": "UgiZECwzKge-kXgCoAEC.8USu1QNo4wp8V0bjSfbRtw", "comment": "Just study and practice.
