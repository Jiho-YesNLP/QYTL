Start off with a retrospective from the renaissance where the perspective was introduced in the painting. How baroque emerged. Look from how impressionism involved into expressionism. How surrealism expressed the subconscious. Because art periods are often linked to historical events or scientific paradigm shifts. Surrealists were very inspired by Freud and his theory of the subconscious for example. It was just an thought or suggestion.
