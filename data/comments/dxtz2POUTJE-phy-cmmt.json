If you are taking a photograph of leaves, the pools of light on the lit bit of the leaf annoyingly come out as a stronger shape than the actual leaf comes out as being, the shine coming off leaves often   often comes out as light, as bits of white in the photograph it comes out as white. If you take a photo of the sunny side of a tree, its colour is much lighter than the other side but even this lighter side does not relfect the shinyness of leaves because on the sunny side of a plant you see the underside and so the non sunny side of the leaves that are above the camara and as leaves are often curved you also see the sides of leaves that are dark because curved away from the sun. I think all this should be mentioned when people categorise the effect of vegetation on climate change.   Another aspect of the usefulness of vegetation as a coooler of the world, without mentioning how they take carbondioxide out of the air, is how very shinny hay and straw are, so this dead vegetation would, if left on the ground, both aislate what is a pretty good material as far as storing heat is concerned, earth, i have read that earth has the same ability to store heat as brick but also, hay and straw are very reflective grasses are full of glass, silica, which should put animals off eating grass, so hay and strawlike live leaves and probably more so, also reflect sun light back towards space.   Have you thought how much land world over  is left fallow for a year where wheat is grown? Half as much as is used to grow wheat,  though this is not an agricultural habit used in modern Norht America? Also lots of land is ploughed in spring, just before the heat of summer, in preparation for autumn planting of wheat so leaving so much earth to accumulate heat, that it is absolultely mind boogling.    once it did nto matter how much of a material which was a good accumulater of heat was left bare to be heated by the sun but now things have changed and it does matter.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dxtz2POUTJE", "cid": "UgyuORPFZTWgxq61GZl4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you soo mucb this video was soo helpful", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dxtz2POUTJE", "cid": "Ugxlje02HvMdaVDXUZF4AaABAg", "comment": "I have a final in 30 mins and I\u2019m studying this now lollllllll I\u2019m about to shit myself", "votes": "7", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dxtz2POUTJE", "cid": "Ugy-xv0JZHY8oEpRp3V4AaABAg", "comment": "?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dxtz2POUTJE", "cid": "UgxvtsCFk3eW5H_PcD14AaABAg", "comment": "Bruh how tf did I learn more here in 20 mins than 8 hours of being taught by an actual teacher.
