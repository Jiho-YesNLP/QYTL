So if f(g(x)) is equal to 2x + 2, then f(f(g(x))) must equal f(2x + 2)  f(2x + 2) = 2x + 2 - 3  Answer should be:  f(2x + 2) = 2x - 1   or   f(f(g(x))) = 2x - 1   Now since we have the answer for f(f(g(x))), we plug that in for g:  g(f(f(g(x)))) = g(2x - 1)  g(2x - 1) = 2x + 5  g(2x - 1) = 2(2x - 1) + 5  g(2x - 1) = 4x - 2 + 5  Answer should be:   g(2x - 1) = 4x + 3  or  g(f(f(g(x)))) = 4x + 3", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "q3zmcFvHxP4", "cid": "Ugy8kFp2vieMNib5o8V4AaABAg.9eYPG71YXqW9lZ80MdeeD-", "comment": "\u00a0@ta_ogboy9998\u00a0 thanks for the efforts", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "q3zmcFvHxP4", "cid": "Ugy8kFp2vieMNib5o8V4AaABAg.9eYPG71YXqW9yiHmi3Zh-D", "comment": "I understand the usefulness of algebra and equations.
