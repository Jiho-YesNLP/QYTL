I'm thinking this might go too advanced for me and I don't want to get demotivated or something like that.

Though, if people here are not getting in any course, I think I'd suggest to get external help to understand why she says the things you do not understand.

These are complicted topics, and this is only an overview. The best way to learn this is taking notes and then researching the topics that seem complicated one by one. You also should start experimenting, there is a very good circuit Electroinc Circuit simulator online (The first one that apears when you search on google for \"falstad simuator\") which you can use to start experimenting with transistors and how to use them to build logic gates. Then you can start working with logic gates themselves using something like the AMAZING \"Gateway Logic Simulator\" that more people should know about, it's a FREE circuit simlator that let's you create custom component, just like what this series does with levels of abstraction. You literaly can follow the whole logic part of the course with that simulator and end up with a complete 8 bit CPU. On the other hand, if you don't know how to program i REALLY recomend you looking into the Processing and P5.js. They have an amazing comunity, a lot of tutorials and examples (The Youtube Chanel Coding Train is pure gold). They are designed with beginers in mind, and are completely graphics oriented, you can even use them to program the 3d engine from later on. Oh, and one final recomendation is to start using linux, at least in a virtual machine, or with the Windows Linux Subsystem on Windows 10. Linux is super friendly with developers, and it's also amazing for networking and hacking. Heck, if you want to program in C on windows you'll probably have to install Visual Studio. That's a 10Gb+ download, and in the end you wouldn't know what's going on with the compiler under the hood at all. While on linux you have the most used C compiler (GCC) preinstalled and ready to go (And yeah, just like all the other software i recomended, linux is a completely free OS). So yeah, those are my little tips. If you decide to go down this rabbit hole, you will learn a lot of amazing stuff and will create a lot of beautifull things. But you have to stay determined, never be afraid of admiting that you don't undestand something, and have the to learn it.

CrashCourse touched on this topic a bit but decimal numbers can't be represented perfectly on hardware. This is about floating point precision.   The following Java code gives an unexpected result:  public class NumericalPrecisionTest {   public static void main(String[] args) {     double cnt = 0.0;     for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {       cnt += 0.01;     }     System.out.println(cnt);   } }  // expected: 1000 x 0.01 = 10 // actual: 9.999999999999831  This has many real-world consequences (think anything financial related). What about irrational numbers like pi?  Another example. I was reading a stack overflow thread a few hours ago where someone got a 20x speedup by sorting an array before iterating through it. That goes against everything you learn in an algorithms course and common sense in general.   So how is it possible to get a 20x speedup by performing more work? Because branch prediction (e.g. design of computer architecture). OP got a recommendation (after a ton of discussion and research) to remove the sorting routine and slightly modify an if expression and BOOM instant gains.  The above are examples of why you learn system hardware while taking CS in University. It's pretty damn important!

It is a little complicated to intuitively understand, which is why I didn't explain it very much in my comment.   Going with that very specific example, if we want to subtract either 10 from 15 (which I think was your intent), we are going to use a 5 bit number, because signed 4 bit numbers only gives us a range of -8 to 7. So, if we want to subtract 1010 from 1111, we need to first turn these into 5 bit numbers. So, we have 01010 and 01111. Next, we realize that we want to subtract 01010, so we will make it negative. Taking the two's compliment gives us 10110. Now, we add this to our 01111 which gives us 100101. This, you may notice, is a 6 bit number. Whenever it overflows, we just get rid of it, which gives us 00101. If you look at what we were doing in decimal, we did 15 - 10, which should be 5. Our answer is 5, so we did it correctly.  The question of course may be why does this work? I can't explain this very well in a YouTube comment, so I'm going to refer you to these two explanations: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1049722/what-is-2s-complement The why in the Cornell link is near the bottom of the page.  If you are still struggling after looking at these, I learned from a book called principles of computer hardware. It is old and outdated now (2006) and also is filled to the brim with typos which make learning confusing, but maybe the chapter 4 computer arithmetic section from that can help you out.
