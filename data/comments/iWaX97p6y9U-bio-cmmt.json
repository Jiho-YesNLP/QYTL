You have a lot of critical but common errors in this video (it is okay, you are clearly not trained in botany, which is common). Here is a short list:  -CO2 doesn't turn into O2, H2O does -gymnosperms and angiosperms also descendants of initial green algae--Plantae is monophyletic -all plants need water for reproduction, was actually a major evolutionary pressure for the pollen tube & ovules -Spanish moss is not a lichen, but rather a flowering plant -alternation of generations description is a mess; alternation of generations is an outdated term used to over simplify the concept of haplodiplonticity, which is based on cell ploidy and multicellularity and not size or independence of the resulting cells/tissues/plant bodies. -SPORES ARE NOT DIPLOID; this is really critical -You never define where meiosis happens in the life cycle; this contributes to your spore error; sexual life cycles are defined by meiosis and fertilization--you cannot teach them adequately without including both -POLLEN IS NOT A GAMETE; it is actually a spore, it germinates via mitosis into a multicellular haploid body that then produces sperm (gamete) via mitosis -compare and contrast of vascular to non-vascular plants is a mess because all the understanding of plant life cycles is based off of misconceptions (see above) and therefore cannot be correctly applied to the vascular plants, which also display full haplodiplonticity or \"alternation of generations.\"  Normally your videos are very good, especially the cellular processes series, and I use them frequently when I teach.

After fertilization the zygote divides meiotically (this life cycle is also known as zygotic meiosis), then the cells resulting from this division will give rise to another gametophyte and the cycle goes on again.   But the relationship between the two organisms (charophyta and bryophytes) is not due to the life cycle but rather to the similarities in the reproductive structures, more specifically a cover of somatic cells in the gametangia.\u00a0 Another simillarity are the pigments (this indicates chloroplast filogenetic relation) wich are in both organisms Chl \"a\" and \"b\". They also have similarities in the habitat, both are from fresh water ecosistems and can survive out of the water.   The change in the life cycle can be due to environmental stress.
