Kinematics, and the way to determine velocity and acceleration given position as a function of time 3. Linear approximation of a difficult-to-calculate function 4. Design of smooth roads and rail paths, so riders of cars and trains can be comfortable  Some applications of integration: 1. Cumulative effects of force distributions, like the force of water on a dam 2. Cumulative effects of time-varying forces, like impulse and work 3.

Given an n-dimensional equivalent of the cube in general, its space occupied its higher dimensional space is given by L^n, and its boundary size would be 2*n*L^(n-1).  For the familiar examples of a square and cube, we can test this as follows: Square (n=2).   Total space is the area, which is L^n, plug in n=2, and get L^2.   Boundary size is called perimeter, which is 2*n*L^(n-1), plug in n=2, and get 4*L for its perimeter.  Cube (n=3).   Total space is the volume, which is L^n, plug in n=3, and get L^3.
