But otherwise equipartition wants to share excess energy with the environment (or in chemistry, the other side of the equation) in a way that depends on entropy, hence we need free energy. Basically, energy is conserved so it must go somewhere, rather than everything wanting to be at minimum energy. Systems with more entropy (e.g. more particles) are willing to accept more energy. For example in air, a molecule wants to bounce around, not be still. Of the many types which are just a Legendre transform apart, Gibbs free energy is chosen because its sign indicates reaction direction (spontaneity) under conditions of constant pressure and temperature.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "QTdJiG7mV40", "cid": "Ugy4YSG0Tcvy5R7Ro1B4AaABAg.9l0z4xOR1eF9qbUZCl179v", "comment": "Wow that's an amazing thing!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "QTdJiG7mV40", "cid": "UgwbE52WEkBhikDjQz94AaABAg.9Uj8o6hxIVQ9Wc5vxfdmYP", "comment": "I think she misspoke, and it is heterotetrameric", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "QTdJiG7mV40", "cid": "UgyaGv0MUjfDOq5nHHN4AaABAg.9TOStN-fntV9TRtg75Lzkd", "comment": "This course doesn't have any lecture notes but there recitation notes, readings, assignments: problem sets with solutions, and exams with solutions.
