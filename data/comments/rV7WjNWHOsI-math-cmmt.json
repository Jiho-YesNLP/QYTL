Being asked to build a house when I knew nothing past how to make the foundation. I\u2019d be embarrassed when confronted, but also far too embarrassed to explain why I didn\u2019t know. My childhood wasn\u2019t golden, and it is something I found myself wishing to hide for a better image. I don\u2019t think it helps that my brain has trouble even processing normal things. I\u2019d been treated badly by a lot of people and now you could tell me the sky was orange and I\u2019d doubt my eyes in favor of your claim. I\u2019d feel the need to believe.  You know whats terrible?  I was shamed and they moved on. No one took the time to teach me. And I felt dreadfully ashamed to look it up. I got over it though, and here I am. No matter what it was that brought anyone older here, It's okay! We all have reasons and you being here and wanting to learn on any of these is wonderful. Lots of us had no control over it and no one took us back to the opportunity. I promise you all that math can also be fun, and very pretty when done correctly.

I am 26 years old, working in IT as a programmer and I was shocked to learn that the result of a subtraction is called \"difference\".  I never saw the minus sign as a operator, instead I thought it's purely here to describe negative values.  Example:  10 - 2 = 8 (The difference is 8)  What I have seen up until your video:  (+10) + (-2) = (+8) (The sum is 8)  You have no idea how much your video helped me.  Hope to advance and keep up.
