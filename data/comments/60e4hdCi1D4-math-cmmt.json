If he was finding the area of a circle, the double integral of r*dr*d\u00f8 with those bounds would indeed be correct and would yield pi/4 because the formula for the circle would be sqrt(x^2+y^2) = r = 1.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "60e4hdCi1D4", "cid": "Ugx_5G70WN-kxTJWzw94AaABAg", "comment": "way to go MIT for the high quality videos!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "60e4hdCi1D4", "cid": "Ugx-jg6kcc2qQOu8fRV4AaABAg", "comment": "Wow, brilliant explanation of Moment of Inertia, far better than I got in physics.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "60e4hdCi1D4", "cid": "Ugz2nYItUHpvmtAxOql4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks a lot for this video, and by the way, for all the others as well. 5 Stars", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "60e4hdCi1D4", "cid": "UgzKNgJ79i5qqMdfW8R4AaABAg.8GcKrDKY2uB9DymefE78d7", "comment": "hey dude are you alive", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "60e4hdCi1D4", "cid": "UgzKNgJ79i5qqMdfW8R4AaABAg.8GcKrDKY2uB9LHRKT6MXmo", "comment": "\u00a0@9888565407\u00a0 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
