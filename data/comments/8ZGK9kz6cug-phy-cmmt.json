To find out the x distance, one could use cos(30) times 4, because cosine is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. Given the hypotenuse, you can multiply that by cos(30) to get the distance of the x. You do the same process for the y, but using sin. In either case, trigonometry is often the easiest way to get the components of a triangle, provided it is a right triangle.
