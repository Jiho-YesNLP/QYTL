He broke down the number of steps an algorithm has to take when searching within 40 elements, showing how we get to the O(log N) aka logarithmic time complexity.  Since this algorithm halves an array until the element is found or halved's length is 1, that means the first halved array would be n/2, where n is the length of the array. If the element is not found, then n/4 if we use the main array's length, otherwise we could say n/2 of the halved array.  I don't think it's important to memorize this, but you should remember that whenever an algorithm keeps halving an array by looping or using recursion, then the time complexity should be O(log N). You can test that by doubling up the size of the input, and see the difference between the number of steps. As per its definition, O(log N) states that the number of steps grows by 1 when the input size is doubled.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "6ysjqCUv3K4", "cid": "Ugw0SXARnbx233rXTpF4AaABAg.9XYjcXJ5YLd9ijhzvXR_v2", "comment": "Actually, it's correct!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "6ysjqCUv3K4", "cid": "UgwXIZVdbdaZKNNCnZh4AaABAg", "comment": "You just made it so simple!

Let\u2019s use 8 as the target. Using the example, the following steps occur:  - algorithm checks arr[3], target is greater than mid(7) so left pointer moves to 4 (target). - algorithm checks arr[5], target is less than mid(9) so right pointer moves to 4 (target). - algorithm checks (4 + 4) / 2, which gives a mid of 4 which returns our target.   Essentially if one pointer lands on the target it will keep searching by dragging the other pointer closer and closer until they\u2019re both on target. The algorithm actually relies on this to find the target, only that if one pointer finds the target early on in the search it will take more iterations before the other target \u201ccatches up\u201d.  You could include a check to see if either pointer is on the target if you wanted to, however given the relatively low number of steps even for large arrays, the provided example would work fine.  The algorithm also \u201ctechnically\u201d checks if the target is outside the array, it just does so indirectly. I guess it just avoids having to write \u2018if\u2019 statements for every edge case you want to check.  In a large array, the chance a random target lands on the element directly adjacent to your middle is pretty small.
