I was planning on maybe getting into some silver and gold purchases and learned of the rather large problem with fake metals being placed inside gold and silver products .  However I also learned that there is a device called a sigma metalitics precious metals verifier the will test metals authenticity based on resistivity.  Well knowing that the multimeter tool from the store costs like 40 bucks and measures resistivity ohms and all that stuff and that this gold tester costs over $2,500 dollars I was wondering,.... well I've been pondering that there must be a way using equations such as yours to verify a metal resistivity and thereby the metal itself since they all have a different resistivity ....  such as taking a reading from the multimeter and then performing an equation on it that should always come out to that metals exact resistivity..... otherwise it would not be authentic gold or silver....  There has to be a way... that must be what they are doing with the expensive machine....   im sure you figured out by now I am wanting to use the resistivity test using the math equations and $40 tool rather then the $2500 dollar tool.  What equations' for a coin and bar would I use.... always at room temp...  to determine if the metal is authentic....  I am thinking that if I know the equations I should be able to use a multi meter and do the calculations myself with a calculator rather than paying 2500 dollars for something to do the calculations for me.. That's one high priced calculator.
