Nothing gets easier but this is what makes it so fun and engaging, mathematics is indeed a fascinating subject. I've always detested Math ever since I was child, mostly due to the fact that my teachers used to present it in a way of following something, they want you to memorize formulas instead of actually understanding how the basics work. And that type of learning stumped my growth.  I prefer mastering the basics first before moving on in much more advanced topics. If I'm unable to, then I wouldn't understand anything they teach me.
