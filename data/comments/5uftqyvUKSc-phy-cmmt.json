What happens if a resistor were to be included? Classical analysis does not provide answers to these questions in an intuitive way. To understand the reason for phase shift in inductive circuits Faraday's law should be applied.

Also, a Coulomb electric field appears and this is hard to explain unless one takes a unified approach to electrostatics and circuits.  How does phase shift occur in a single capacitor? What happens if a resistor were to be included? Classical analysis does not provide answers to these questions in an intuitive way.
