The example is actually about comparing the average number of opposite-gender sexual relations, not the number of distinct opposite-gender sexual partners.  The lecturer mentioned that the sum of the degrees of the F vertices represents the total number of opposite-gender partners for all females. However, this isn't entirely accurate. Imagine a scenario where all females have the same male partner. In that case, the total number of opposite-gender partners for all females would be just one, which doesn\u2019t reflect the actual total number of edges in the graph.  A more accurate description would be to say that the sum of the degrees of the F vertices represents the total number of sexual relations with opposite-gender partners for all females. This phrasing correctly accounts for the actual number of interactions (edges) in the graph, rather than just the number of distinct partners.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "h9wxtqoa1jY", "cid": "UgwrCeD-zsn6yG6jnbx4AaABAg", "comment": "I just ge a bit frustrated when I notice there are empty chairs in the room...

But I can prove it by induction on d only. First, pick a the vertex whose deg is d + 1, removed it and all the edges containing it. If the remaining graph stil has a vertex whose deg is d + 1, then keep doing like above untill we get the final graph such that each degree is <= d. (remember each step we removed not only the vertex degree d + 1 but also the edge contaning that vertex ).   Notice that there are no removed vertices adjacent each other. We can prove this by contradiction. Assuming there are two removed vertices called a,b such that a and b are adjacent. We can also assume a is deleted first. After deleting a, the degree of b would be d ( as b is adjacent to a). This means the vertex b, as a result, will never be cleared. This contradicts to what we are assuming above (a,b are two removed vectices)  Applying the induction hypothesis on the final graph, we need <= d + 1 colors to colors this graph. Now rejoin all of deleted vertices and edges. We can choose a color to color so that all removed vertices have the same colors (we can do so as they aren't adjacent to each other). Whether this color is old or new, the number of color we use is still <= ( d + 1) + 1 = d + 2.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "h9wxtqoa1jY", "cid": "UgxltmfzAFBq5T4ou5Z4AaABAg", "comment": "At first, we proved that the basic algorithm will use at most d + 1 colors on any graph.

I believe the professor simply made a mistake in overlooking that distinction.  If you only consider the people who have had a sexual relationship or a study session with minorities/non-minorities, then obviously the percentage that participate in these partnerships would be 100%. So, then the pertinent question would be the average number of partners, in which case study partners and sexual partners would be comparable, and this method of induction would be applicable.

Wouldn't the average degree only be equal if he is considering the population of people who have been in these partnerships? If he uses the 300 estimate for the population, he is also considering people who have not been in a partnership i.e. degree of 0. The only way now for both degree averages to be the same is if the ratio of 0 degree men to 0 degree women is the exact same ratio of men to women in the population.

For the four boys there is also a 1-to-1 ratio. if you exclude the unconnected nodes, it would be 4 relationships for every single girl but you've created a universe with only 1 girl and 4 boys so it would make perfect sense if that were the case.   Now do we know exactly how many relationships every individual will have? Of course not, but that's also not the point. And these sociological studies can't make that claim either. If anything, these survey studies only suggest that men either exaggerate the number of partners they have or women understate the number of men they've been with. Societal norms suggest it's a bit of both.  Also if you study sociology, abandon ship. It's the most counterproductive area of research to be in. People only pay attention to certain studies that conform to the general biases of the field which lead to a snow-balling effect. Sociology is supposed to teach us that many of our fears are the result of misperceptions, but unfortunately sociologists themselves are a big contributor  to such misperceptions.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "h9wxtqoa1jY", "cid": "UghXucjaOLo5angCoAEC.7-H0Z7-OdTo8g-1VkMyZWP", "comment": "Science must provide falsifiable explanations, and make falsifiable predictions.
