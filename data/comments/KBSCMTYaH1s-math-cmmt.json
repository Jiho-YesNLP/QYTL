Seems kinda foofy, but here's my reason:  So all these manipulations make perfect sense for displacement, cuz it is after all length, and the geometry works for lengths.   So, if it makes sense for displacement, won't it work for say displacement in a period of time? Hence it's justifiable for velocity, and similarly acceleration.   So I thought what if all vectors have displacement (and the basic involvement of length)? And I searched and searched and found that all vectors have length in some way or the other.   Tldr: it works for displacement/distance (cuz geometry) and since all the vectors I know have length involved with some other scalars like mass, charge, etc. that proportionality still holds good.   Hope that makes sense! (I recognize my arguments crumble if you find a vector which doesn't have length/, distance in it, so lemme know if you find any).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "KBSCMTYaH1s", "cid": "Ugzxv6zjyqwf1hI57j14AaABAg.8yCLOEBxHl99HmVdulb0bT", "comment": "Thankyou so much for a good explanation.
