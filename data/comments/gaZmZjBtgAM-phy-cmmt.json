It doesn't depend on the path taken between the two states.  Internal energy is directly determined by Cv, because when heating at constant volume, heat Q equals change in internal energy deltaU, which by definition equals n*Cv*deltaT, assuming Cv is constant.  If you are interested in change in internal energy, regardless of the process, you can use Cv to evaluate it, when knowing the temperature change.  More formally, because Cv does change with temperature, this really would be an integral if you knew the details of how Cv varies with temperature.  At that point, you are probably looking up u-values in a reference table anyway.  Heat and work are path functions, and it is only when you have constant volume that you can use Q=n*Cv*deltaT.  At constant pressure, Cv gets replaced with Cp when finding Q, but when finding deltaU at constant pressure, you still can use n*Cv*deltaT.  You just have another destination for the heat at constant pressure, which you'd account for with P*deltaV, and we coin the term enthalpy (H) to represent the aggregate destination of heat when heating at constant pressure (change in internal energy plus work done on the surroundings to make space for it).", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "gaZmZjBtgAM", "cid": "UgwHU9gS1yETXBB4Fwp4AaABAg", "comment": "On all the comments about the sign for dU = Q + W or -W.
