So if the reaction is at equilibrium, then the ratio of products to reactants will equal both Kc and Q (as Q=Kc at equilibrium).  But if change the concentration of a reactant or a product, then at that instant the reaction will no longer be at equilibrium, and the ratio of products to reactants will still equal Q by definition, but it will not equal Kc (since the reaction is not at equilibrium).  But you could also look at the situation mathematically and say that this is why the reaction will shift...in order to get back to equilibrium.  If the altering of the concentration resulted in Q < Kc, then the reaction will shift to the right until we once again reach equilibrium and Q = Kc again.  Or If the altering of the concentration resulted in Q > Kc, then the reaction will shift to the left until we once again reach equilibrium and Q = Kc again.  Ultimately, changing a concentration does change the ratio and this changes Q, but not Kc (as a reminder the only thing that results in a change in Kc is a change in temperature).
