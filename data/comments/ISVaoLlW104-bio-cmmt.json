Controversial views on its powerful insights or being labeled as gibberish. 04:48 \ud83e\uddec Exploring how behavior genetics identifies genetic components by examining shared traits in individuals with varying degrees of shared genes. 08:36 \ud83e\uddec Discussing the classic approach using identical twins versus fraternal twins to infer genetic influence on behavioral traits. 10:31 \ud83e\uddec Complications in the twin study approach, considering differences in environment and shared genes. 15:15 \u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udeb9 Examining gender differences to infer genetic influence, challenged by early environment variations and subtle behavioral differences from birth. 18:32 \ud83e\uddec\ud83d\udeb9\ud83d\udeba Critical analysis of the influential Benbow and Stanley study on gender differences in math skills, highlighting flaws in assuming identical educational environments. 21:49 \ud83e\udde0 Behavioral genetics study claimed to discover a \"math gene\" with gender differences in advising, leading to media hype. 24:40 \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Landmark study by Seymour Kety in the late '60s examined schizophrenia's genetic component using adoption studies in Denmark. 27:29 \ud83e\uddec Kety found a 9% incidence of schizophrenia in adopted individuals with a biological legacy of schizophrenia, indicating a strong genetic component. 30:23 \u2699\ufe0f Adoption studies faced challenges such as postnatal shared environment, prenatal effects, and issues of paternity uncertainty. 37:00 \ud83d\udc6d Identical twins separated at birth became the gold standard for behavior genetics, showing about 50% heritability for IQ, introversion/extroversion, and aggression. 41:20 \ud83d\udd04 Critique: Non-random placement of adopted children in families limited the power of identical twins studies; solutions included comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins. 44:10 \ud83e\udd30 Prenatal environmental effects are often underappreciated, challenging the assumption that environment begins at birth. 45:07 \ud83e\udde0 The traditional approach of comparing monozygotic with dizygotic twins assumes environment starts at birth, overlooking prenatal influences. 47:32 \ud83e\udd30 Prenatal environmental factors, such as hormonal changes, influence fetal development and can have long-lasting effects, even spanning generations. 48:56 \ud83e\udde0 Hormonal variations in prenatal environments, such as exposure to glucocorticoids, can impact brain development and influence traits like puberty onset. 49:54 \ud83e\udd30 Maternal age and stress during pregnancy can affect offspring, demonstrating non-genetic transmission of traits and linking prenatal conditions to adult outcomes. 53:41 \ud83c\udf7c Nutrients shared in the prenatal environment play a crucial role, as seen in the Dutch Hunger Winter example, linking famine exposure to adult metabolic disorders. 56:59 \ud83e\udd30 Fetal metabolic programming during times of nutrient scarcity, like the Dutch Hunger Winter, leads to a thrifty phenotype and increased risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood. 01:03:36 \ud83d\udc76 Prenatal learning is possible, demonstrated by rats showing preferences for flavors consumed in amniotic fluid and humans recognizing their mother's voice in the womb. 01:05:01 \ud83d\udcda Prenatal influences on behavior: Study involving pregnant women reading \"The Cat in the Hat\" shows newborns prefer the familiar story, indicating prenatal learning. 01:07:22 \ud83d\udc2d Prenatal effects on anxiety: Rat study by Darlene Francis reveals anxiety levels in offspring match those of the mother, challenging the assumption of solely genetic traits. 01:13:26 \ud83e\uddec Asymmetry in DNA inheritance: Mitochondrial DNA, inherited exclusively from the mother, carries genes related to mitochondrial function, impacting genetic influence distribution. 01:18:41 \ud83d\udd00 Lamarckian inheritance: Environmental factors disrupting transcription factors in eggs lead to non-expressing genes, resembling Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits. 01:21:29 \ud83d\udd04 Indirect genetic effects on behavior: Height, appearance, and feather color heritability indirectly influence traits like extroversion, rank in social hierarchy, and pecking behavior in chicks. 01:26:16 \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Heritability of political party affiliation: Studies suggest approximately 70% heritability, challenging assumptions about the role of genetics in political preferences. 01:27:12 \ud83c\udf10 Political and social progressives versus conservatives often show a reliable personality difference in ambiguity tolerance. Conservatives, on average, are more ambiguity-averse, and this trait seems to have a genetic component. 01:28:08 \ud83e\uddec Aggression in rat and mouse strains is a genetically influenced trait, but it's mediated by genetic differences in neurobiology of pain sensitivity. Traits with genetic components often manifest through indirect routes. 01:29:32 \ud83e\uddec Epigenetic changes, beyond genes, can lead to multigenerational inheritance of non-genetic traits. Environmental factors, like neonatal handling in rats, influence gene expression and behavior across generations. 01:30:56 \ud83e\uddec Epigenetic differences in access to transcription factors related to insulin metabolism were observed in the Dutch Hunger Winter people and animal models, demonstrating multigenerational effects of epigenetic changes. 01:35:37 \ud83e\uddec Behavioral neurobiology studies, like those by Michael Meaney, reveal that early experiences, such as maternal behavior in rats, can cause lifelong changes in gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. This includes multigenerational effects and reversibility with later experiences.

Evolution of psychology and ethology  The history and evolution of psychology and ethology includes the dominance of behaviorism in American psychology, the importance of studying animal behavior in natural environments, and the benefits of enriched environments for brain development. Animal behavior has become a significant aspect of ethology, as understanding such behavior provides important insights into the adaptive mechanisms and survival strategies.  2. Fixed action patterns in animals and humans  Fixed action patterns, observed in both animals and humans, are innate behaviors triggered by specific environmental stimuli. The concept has been studied by ethologists and evolutionary biologists for its adaptive value and role in passing on genes over generations. Learning and experience can enhance these behaviors, but their hardwired nature remains a key aspect of these patterns.  3. Studying animal behavior and communication  Animal behavior studies include the exploration of communication methods and sensory modalities. Researchers use experimental techniques to study fixed action patterns in animals, such as bee dance languages and the use of robotic animals to elicit responses from real animals. Understanding how animals perceive and interact with their environment has led to groundbreaking discoveries in various fields.  4. Importance of touch and cuteness in development  Touch is a critical aspect of healthy infant development, and positive reinforcement goes beyond food to include physical and emotional comfort. The phenomenon of cuteness in baby animals has been studied and incorporated into popular culture, as these features evoke nurturing and protective instincts in adults.  5. Neuro ethology and behavioral understanding  Neuro-ethology examines animal behavior by understanding the neural and endocrine processes underlying it. This approach has led to significant progress in various fields, including bird song neurobiology, the female hamster lordosis reflex, and brain chemistry studies of baboons in their native habitats. Ethologists have also discovered traditional and unexpected types of learning in animals.  6. Learning and adaptation in animal behavior  Animals are capable of learning and adapting through trial and error, classical conditioning, and tool-making. Experience and hands-on practice are vital to mastering skills like parenting, hunting, and tool-making, with larger social groups facilitating earlier development of these abilities.  7. Unconventional learning and awareness in animals  Unconventional learning types in animals, such as imprinting and prepared learning, challenge the traditional reinforcement theory. For example, bees exhibit a preference for smell associations over shape associations when learning food sources, and humans and monkeys quickly associate spiders and snakes with unpleasant stimuli.  8. Animal cognition, self-awareness, and understanding  Animal cognition studies include understanding self-awareness, as demonstrated through the mirror test and other experiments. Animals like chimpanzees, non-human primates, and birds possess cognitive abilities such as recognizing individual voices, understanding numbers, and having a theory of mind. They can also distinguish between intentional and unintentional behaviors and plan for the future. These findings fall within the realm of cognitive ethology, which studies animals' cognitive abilities.

By the early 1920's Marais was publishing in a series for the South African magazine 'Huisgenoot' and by the late 1920's he had published his seminal book on the behaviour of termites 'The Soul of the White Ant'. He had experiences which were unparalleled in Europe, living in the remote Waterberg region and observing nature first hand. He was the first man to live among baboons, which Professor Sapolsky may find interesting. Very sad that his life's work was stolen and his life ended in suicide. He was the true pioneer of ethology. I defy anyone to read 'The Soul of the White Ant/Termite' and disagree. Fixed Action Patterns are something my Grandmother interpreted in chickens without knowing it.

It's quite common to people confude \"negative reinforcement\" and \"(positive) punishment\"; but not only they are not synonyms, but actually literal antonyms (a subject noticing the improving of \"negative liberty\" in relation to a need, versus a subject noticing an obstacle when pathing towards some nice expectancy).  The usual conflation happens because of tranferable learning with the words from different contexts. The remedy is checking casuistry of reference; glancing over textual ideas one can easily find alternative interpretations (or hardly, if understanding identity in simplistic prejudices). Behaviorism relies quite a bit on concepts, but it's deeply experimental in nature. The purpose that nurtures the concepts is not learning to explain behavior (in a static past), but rather learning to predict and modify behavior (in a dynamic present).  ------- ----- --- --  00 Non-related extra-checking: Steamboat Willie has four fingers, not five.  01 Related extra commentary: the behaviorist understanding of learning (a relatively stable change of relative behavior [not trial-and-error as video-stated]) is applicable to species as well as organisms (and [arguably, but contendously so {for there're philosophical clashes in changing from a kind of monism to a different one}] superorganisms [such as anthills or cities] and infraorganisms [such as cells or attitudes]); that may be a short description that may or may not help wonders in understanding.   > Caution: Using abstract constructs alongside experimental hypoteses can easily mislead concepts (non falseable description, such as mathematical axioms: \"1u+1u=2u\"; which may describe as accurate, but not necessarily as valid) into faith (non falseable prediction, such as quasi-paradoxical quasi-redundances: \"willing as thou hast been must be what would have been\"; which may contextualize, but not predict). - Special attention should be practiced when changing between relatable qualities.

A brain damaged woman is talking to her husband in a room. The husband leaves and comes back a little later and the woman doesn't recognize her husband. As soon as he identifies himself she recognizes her husband and they continue their prior conversation. The woman had a part of her brain damaged that affected short term memory, and where her brain stored the memory of visual images. She saw her husband when she was talking to him. She could see, but couldn't remember anything she saw. I bet she wouldn't recognize herself in a mirror until she moved in front of it. Maybe not even then. I have often wondered about it, ever since I saw the documentary she was in and the subject of animals being self aware. A dogs primary sense is smell, not vision. I heard of an inadequate test using smell to determine if dogs could recognize themselves through odor, but what's needed is an experiment to be developed by some clever person that doesn't depend on vision. Then again, it's obvious that dogs are self aware and why anyone would believe they weren't because somebody or people said they don't meet a qualifying standard set by humans, makes no sense to me. Any animal that can recognize another animal and predict, or assess its behavior, recognize agency and intent, is self aware. Plants communicate with each other, fungi, and insects, and can even learn. Experiments that display behavior that we humans define as learning, is being observed by scientists that won't or don't want to say learning, because what they have observed is learned behavior that no branch of science provides an explanation, or even a theory for. Slime mold intelligence. Transmission of memory in slime molds. Plant memory and learning. Check out \"Intelligence Without Brains\" on You Tube. Mind bending stuff. Science has never answered what our conscious mind is. Birds build nests, and spiders weave webs, and they are both tools. Dismissing them as tools because they are built by instinct and not intelligence is a display of ignorance born of hubris. We don't know enough to know what we don't know. Mr Sapolsky should find a qualified shaman and experience Ayahuasca or do a little research on how to take Psilocybin Mushrooms. He is obviously a very intelligent and well educated man, but his saying dogs aren't self aware shows the rigidity of his thinking.

I believed and invested my career heavily in that idea. I know the work of Piaget and Montesorri well and taught the theories in Early Chilhood Development under grad psych courses. I dont think they are incorrect but there is more genetic influence on learning than we wsnt to admit.  I do know that all the Head Start Research shows a slight positive effect for up to two years three at most for children in Head Start. And I do know the demographic you mention.Some of the problems are the atitutudes toward education in the home. No books, never seeing a parent read a book, parents modeling other bahaviors like daytime TV , TV on junk shows all day and all night as background noise so children HAVE NO quiet place to read if they want to. And that is in the more pleasant environments...I wont mention the bad ones...we all know what goes on in the bad homes. THOSE poor kids have almost no chance of learning much or coming out healthy and happy in adulthood , who would?  However recent studies, twin studies in Australia with samples in the thousands of twins separated at birth show statisticslly that identical twins raised in very different homes, positive ones and negative ones,end up.having almost the very same outcomes! This means genetics plays a MUCH stronger role than environment. Those children were not usually placed in the WORST homes because agencies do try to screen for alcoholism, drug addiction, police records of violent homes etc...but these studies show a very high genetic component to outcomes.See the work of Pinker...he shows FMRIbraiin scans of the structures of brains active in learning tasks etc where both identical twins have the same anatomical activations like exact maps of each other so different environments have been conclusively SHOWN to NOT have changed neural pathways and structures and neurotransmitters in brains solving cognitive problems, etc etc so all the Head Start, Piaget, Montessori etc ie ENRICHMENT of learning has far less effect than we had hoped. Not to mention the decades of anecdotal and outcome research showing the same.  Perhaps you dont want to believe that, the education establishment certainly does not want to believe that, because it is an industry requiring ever mushrooming amounts of funds to provide these demonstration projects that turn into generally funded curricula...as I said, an industry and one that does not stand up to close statistical evaluative research regarding results. They say \" well it isnt us its the home\" but more and more research sadly shows this NOT to be true.   There is now  strong predictive results showing heritablity in IQ, all sorts of abilities, interests, mental illnesses ( my field of specialty as a clincical psychologist and professor training grad stdents as well as undergrads). NONE of us likes this, but for HONEST scientists and researchers more and more of the research is irrefutable.  We want SO MUCH to save people, to cure people, to.fix people, to help people learn better and more, to help people be more succesdful, happier, with less personal strife and suffering but there is no magic pill, education theory, or psychologicsl theory that does that. We CAN and do tinker around the edges and take great solace in whatever small gains we can make and positive outcomes we can cite, but it is a question of asking :\"Are the gains worth the billions and trillions of dollars thathave been and sre being spent?\"..this is a question for TAXPAYERS, not policymakers any longer, because policymakers we know only too well, have ulterior interests at stake careers, raises, fiefdoms, the mushrooming of state and federal agencies where very little of real progress is ever made....it is for a society to decide where to put resources that in fact belong to individual taxpayers.   I have recieved many Federal and state grants, as well as GIVEN many state grants in my career when I was asst director of a state agency in the late 70s /early 80s.  There have just been TOO MANY decades where we have wasted enormous amount of funds often on projects we already had data would prove to have almost zero effect ...careers were invloved, lobbyists were being paid to get those public funds. Our systems are in sore need of a realignment , evaluations of programs based ln what we know NOW, not what we wished to be true in the 60s to the 90s.

Tax payers should demand responsibility and accountability. Sadly though even the GAO doing audits of the federal government admits they can\u2019t do a full audit because parts of the federal government they can\u2019t audit. They have a going concern of the federal government. If a public corporation got that audit result they\u2019d be freaking have their stock crash basically.   The U.S. artificially kept interest rates low so go screw over social security that can only own government debt. It really started with long term capital management bailout. The government created the dotcom and 2008 bubble and the 2020 crash and 2021 bubble. It\u2019s funny that people trust the government but then they compare saying there\u2019s wealth inequality. It\u2019s like of course there\u2019s more wealth inequality. Obama had a chance to reset the system but he chose tk save the rich and had bernanke preach the wealth effect. Low interest rates makes money cheap and transfers wealth to the rich. Like Rick rule says he didn\u2019t benefit at all from the government handouts in 2020 to businesses. Where rich benefited the most was 20 years of super low interest rates letting them get assets and the inflation pushed assets up.   Medicare runs out bg 2028, social security runs out by 2035 and when the government prints tk bail it out it\u2019ll be super inflationary.   The sad thing is it\u2019s become normal for democrats to say MMT maybe a great thing. Real modern monetary theory promoted by professor kelton is the government can print money without issuing debt. It\u2019s true. Lincoln did it and it\u2019s the reason the north won their war of aggression or war against seceding cause it certainly wasn\u2019t a civil war since the south didn\u2019t want to control the north. Kelton says there\u2019s no need for bonds. She basically says ya banks may use them for collateral but it doesn\u2019t matter at all. It\u2019s hilarious. She\u2019s like printing money is fine if it keeps up with goods and services expansion. That\u2019s true in theory. But she says once we have inflation then you must solve that. And that\u2019s where I think she\u2019s doomed in her belief. She honestly thinks if we change the laws to do MMT that politicians will have the self restraint to cut spending etc when there\u2019s high inflation or money expansion beyond the expansion of goods and services.   2020 was a great example. Governments locked down workers reducing the supply of goods and services. Millions of small businesses died. Supply shrunk. Then the government gave out checks to people and bigger checks to businesses. That increased demand. It\u2019s like of course there\u2019d be inflation. 40% of all dollars in existence were printed in that year and or year after. Like the money expansion was way beyond the retraction of goods and services.   Hopefully the U.S. don\u2019t take us to war and try to get Russia and China to strike. We don\u2019t need the world joining the BRICs and dedollarizing.

He is probably aware that dancing is taking place on the vertical honeycombs rather than on the horizontal floor but he wanted to present the subject in a simpler way.\r \r The fact that the floor is a space that the 40 to 60 thousand bees of the hive use only to climb on the honeycombs they crowd, is known by all beekeepers.\r \r But the fact that dancing takes place on the vertical honeycombs also introduces the gravitational field of the earth, making the problem a little more complex. I want to say that the bees dancing on the vertical honeycombs inside  the dark hive transmit a gravitational signal, a gravitational information, if you want a touch-type information, which when the bees who get it come out at the entrance of the hive in the daylight, convert into visual information. We do not know by what mechanisms within the bee's body a gravitational touch information is transformed into visual information, we only know that by dancing the 8 formed dance, bees who follow the dancing of the collector fieldbee  suffer the same relative inclinations of their body parts (head, chest and abdomen) depending on the slope of the symmetry axis which is perpendicular to the lobes of the 8. This axis is correlated  with the gravitational line, an angle is formed between them with one leg the line of gravity and the other leg the symmetry axis of  the 8. When the bees come out to daylight follow a course determined by an angle that is the same as the angle that was written in the dark hive on the vertical combs, now one leg is the straight line joining the hive with the projection of the Sun on the horizon on a horizontal plane and the other leg is the one with the hive as angletop  passes from the point where the flowering is located. We see, therefore, that a gravitational information has been transformed into visual, electromagnetic information.\r \r Researchers were able to interrupt the flow of information either by sealing the eyes of the bees who could no longer see where the sun was relative to the flower, or by cutting some of the small bristles between the three parts of the insect body (head, chest, and abdomen) and which transmit the sensation of tilt to the nervous system and the brain of the bee.\r \r  As I said above, nothing removes or adds something to what the professor teaches. It is just a detail which shows that besides the information governed by the electromagnetic light field, we have an information phase within the gravitational field, making the image more complex (and more amazing). \r \r Yannis Alexakis.", "votes": "5", "replies": "5", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ISVaoLlW104", "cid": "UgzWAtYm-LfgEIybH854AaABAg", "comment": "The bees do not \"dance\" on the floor of the hive.

Eventually you get to where you have two chimps that can see each other but not interact. One chimp has to choose from between two numerals, and the number of treats they choose is given to the other chimp. The choosing chimp soon learns to always pick the lower value numeral so that the other chimp gets fewer treats than it does.   The fun part is, if you replace abstract numerals with actual piles of treats, the choosing chimp always selects the greater pile (which then goes to the other chimp). They can deal in abstract numbers but can't get over the instinct to grab the bigger pile of food.

Here is a copy and paste of my latest TOE idea along with the associated gravity test for your perusal:  Revised TOE: 3/25/2017a.\r My Current TOE:\r \r THE SETUP:\r 1. Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.\r  ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.\r \r a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.\r b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.\r c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.\r (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)\r d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.\r e. Do this with the em fields on and off.\r (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.)\r f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.\r (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)\r \r (An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)\r \r 'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done.\r 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what 'gravity' was not, which is still something in the scientific world.

It goes beyond any quantum field theory formulas that I am currently aware of.  The outline though is basically as follows:\r \r The formula has at least 3 levels to it:\r 1. The Internal Photon Level:  The 3 interacting forces, (which might even be just a singular force with 3 different modalities), all interacting at basically 90 degrees to each other and all simultaneously pulsating and swirling.  A complex part of the formula but I believe to be totally doable.\r \r 2. The External Photon Level:  For each pulsating, swirling photon, all the pulsating, swirling photons interacting with it.  An exponential part of the formula that I am not even sure modern day super computers could adequately handle.\r \r 3. The Inter-dimensional Photon Level:  For each modality within each photon would have an energy frequency associated with it.  The energy frequencies could be seen as being in their own space time dimension.  (For me, 'space' is energy itself of which is the 'gem' photon and 'time' is the flow of energy; 'temperature' is the interaction of energy), so one would be dealing with way more than just 3 spatial dimensions and way more than just 1 time dimension (as there would many different energy frequencies with many different flows of energy).  Whenever like resonate energy frequencies resonated with each other, they would affect each other, kind of like 'spooky action at a distance'.  Anytime energy frequencies overlapped, there would be a temporary spike of some sort in each space time dimension.  In addition, if in reality the 'gem' photon is just a singular force with 3 different modalities, it's possible that energy could 'slip' between modalities which would also affect the results.  A very complex part of the formula on top of all the complexity that came before it.\r \r 4. Any time any energy moved in the system, the entire formula would have to be recalculated due to potential ripple effects.\r \r Like I said above, I don't even believe the mathematics exists yet for what I am trying to do, but at a minimum, the formula would contain the above levels the way I currently see it to be.\r \r ____________________________________________________________________________\r \r 'IF' my latest TOE idea is really true, (and I fully acknowledge the 'if' at this time), that the pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon is the energy unit of this universe that makes up everything in existence in this universe, and what is called 'gravity' is a part of what is currently recognized as the 'em' photon, then the oscillation of these 3 interacting modalities of the energy unit would be as follows:\r \r Gravity: Maximum in one direction, Neutral, Maximum in the other direction;\r Electrical: Maximum in one direction, Neutral, Maximum in the other direction;\r Magnetic: Maximum in one direction, Neutral, Maximum in the other direction.\r \r Then:\r 1 singular energy unit, with 3 different modalities, with 6 maximum most reactive positions, with 9 total basic reactive positions (neutrals included).

That said it is incredibly annoying to hear him bash Skinner and then go on to explain basic reinforcement concepts incorrectly. Within the first 10 minutes he equated negative reinforcement with punishment, which reveals a complete misunderstanding of the terms, because essentially these are opposites. He seems to be using positive and negative in the good/bad sense, when in reality Skinner intended positive and negative to mean something very specific: the addition or subtraction of a stimulus that influences the future probability of a particular behavior. This includes positive reinforcement (stimulus added and rate of behavior increases), negative reinforcement (stimulus removed and behavior increases), positive punishment (stimulus added which decreases behavior), and negative punishment (stimulus removed which decreases behavior).

That's Lamarckian evolution and it's not how things generally work. What you learn can create an outcome that in turn has heritable consequences, but that's not the same thing, and it's not going to preserve the thing you learned - it might just reinforce it. And that kind of repetition across generations would generally not function as a fixed action pattern.  For example, five immigrants move to a new country. One of them learns the local language, four don't. The one who learns the language ends up with a better job and their kids are bigger, stronger and have less prenatal stress. This can become heritable (these kids might in turn be more likely to have bigger, stronger kids with less prenatal stress), but it doesn't mean the kids or their kids or their kids come out speaking a language. They might be more likely to learn it because of the factors that were passed down - but that's not a fixed action pattern and it will never become \"hard-wired.\"  - If it's selected for gradualistically, then it's not \"learned.\"  It's just at some point at random a gull started turning their shells over because of some biological drive, and then that gull out-reproduced the others. Yeah it might look like the gull learned how to do it, but that's not what's happening.  If there's a behavioral component, it might involve a behavior that brought the organism into a new environment or exposed them to some new pressure that prompted the trait to outcompete. Maybe.  - If you remember the bit about epigenetics and transcription factors, the way our heritable information becomes part of our physical body and behavior involves a lot of complex \"if-then\" statements, where a small change in a factor, or in the environment, or in the part of our genetic code that is not expressed into amino acids and proteins can change a whole bunch of things at once. And so the gull might have been doing some unrelated thing that involved speckles or wanting to turn things over, it might have been a spandrel from some other characteristic, and with a tweak to the right transcription factor suddenly the gull is turning over their eggs. The fixed action pattern does not have to have originated from something that had a similar purpose.  - Fixed action patterns are not so precise as to be the same as advantageous behaviors. The environment or situation can change the outcome of the fixed action pattern, or what it would look like to a human observer - the action pattern is fixed, but what it means or what it accomplishes are not fixed.
