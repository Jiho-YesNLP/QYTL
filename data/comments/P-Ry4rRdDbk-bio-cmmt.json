Who cares whether the bases only differ slightly. Any difference is enough to encode information.  Boringness shouldn't come into it, I would have thought. What bearing does that have on whether it is the \"transforming principle\"?  Does he mean those scientists were subpar? If so, why not let us know that? I wish Lander had explained what he meant. Edit: Also, so what if (a strange conclusion) \"DNA has to be structural, given that it is boring\" (or words to that effect)? Even if it were structural it could also carry heredity information, just as a load-bearing wall can have writing on it, or could encode information in different color bricks\".
