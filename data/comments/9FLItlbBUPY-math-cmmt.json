It's distinct from the dot product, which yields a scalar. 35:41 \ud83e\udd14 The cross product formula involves a symbolic determinant with unit vectors i, j, k. The actual calculation expands to three terms corresponding to each unit vector. 37:03 \ud83d\udccf The length of the cross product vector represents the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors a and b in space. 38:09 \ud83d\udd04 The direction of the cross product vector is perpendicular to the plane formed by vectors a and b. The right-hand rule determines whether it points upward or downward. 48:29 \ud83d\udccf The volume of a parallelepiped formed by vectors a, b, and c can be calculated using the triple product, where the determinant of ABC is equal to the dot product of a with the cross product of b and c.

Therefore the net force in the normal direction is zero. String tension is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the normal component of pendulum weight. 2) The pendulum displays oscillating harmonic motion in the tangential direction. It should be obvious that the only time the tangential force is zero, is when the pendulum passes through the equilibrium (lowest) position. At any position where the pendulum is displaced to the side, there will be a tangential component of the pendulum weight that accelerates the pendulum back towards the equilibrium position. In harmonic systems this is referred to as a \"restoring force\". 3) If we assume zero air resistance or friction, the harmonic system is undamped, and will continue to oscillate indefinitely. With damping, the amplitude of oscillation gradually decreases, unless power is somehow delivered to compensate for energy loss via damping.
