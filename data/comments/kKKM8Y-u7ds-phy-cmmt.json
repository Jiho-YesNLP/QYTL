You just have a grossly flawed understanding of the laws.   The first law states that an object in uniform motion will remain in that same exact state of uniform motion if no unbalanced forces are acting upon it.  The third law states that every force has an equal and opposite reaction force.   An object will NOT remain in its state of motion of an unbalanced force is acting on it.  You say it will; that's not what law of inertia says.  A book remains at rest on a table because there are no unbalanced forces acting on it.  There are two forces acting on the book.  You mention only one of these forces (the table pushing upward on the book).  There is an equal force to this in the downward direction : gravity.  These two forces both act on the book in opposite directions, and therefore cancel each other.  They are balanced.   Perhaps you are just confused - because the two forces I mentioned that were acting on the book are NOT a force pair.  Force pairs NEVER act on the same body.  There are two DIFFERENT force pairs at work here.  You have the force of gravity on the book from the Earth - the opposite being the force of gravity on the Earth from the book.  Then you have the actual contact force the book exerts on the Earth - the opposite of which is the table pushing up on the book.  When you identify all of these forces, you find two forces acting on the book that cancel each other.

But there is something I can't get my head round in relation to the laws of physics with a round disk full of information. I will try to explain what I mean. A record will turn at a set speed say 45 RPM. how can the center or near center turn at the same speed as the outer perimeter and arrive back to the start at the same time as the outer? Or let say if you walked around the inner circle of your town at 12 miles per hour from a starting point and at the same time someone else walked around the outer circle of your town at the exact speed 12 miles per hour who would have completed the walk first. I think logic would say, well you would because you had less distance to walk as you were on the inner circle. I hope you're still with me? So now if you place a record on a turntable and drew a white line from the center to the outer edge then switch on the rotation at 45 RPM the inner circle will arrive back at the starting point the exact same time as the outer circle.? how can this be possible.

The force on the ball is only being applied for a very short time.  Suppose that you can accelerate your hand up to 20 m/s, and for the sake of simplicity, you can do this whether you have a ball in your hand or not.  When you punch the ball, your hand is only in contact with that ball for a tiny fraction of a second, but the ball accelerates up to 20 m/s.  So, the ball goes from 0 m/s to 20 m/s in something like 0.05 seconds.  The acceleration here is v/t, or 20 / .05 = 400 m/s\u00b2.  The mass of a typical football is about 0.4 kg, so the force exerted is F = ma, or 0.4 * 400 = 160 Newtons.     When you throw a ball, you are in contact with the ball for a lot longer.  Probably about half a second.  You still accelerate the ball up to 20 m/s, but you do so over 0.5 seconds, so the acceleration then is only 40 m/s\u00b2 which means the force was only 16 Newtons.   This force also acts back on you, so it would make sense that the one with the force of 160 Newtons (10 times the force on the throw) would hurt while the throw does not.   In your ice example, assuming it is a frictionless surface, you would accelerate backwards as soon as you started applying a force to the other person and for as long as you are applying a force to the other person with equal mass - and that person would accelerate in the opposite direction at the same rate.  Once you are no longer making contact (no longer applying a force), you would still move, but you would not be accelerating anymore.  You would just continue with whatever velocity you had the moment you stopped applying a force.   A shower nozzle reacting to water coming out, a firearm recoil, and rockets are all examples of Newton's third law at work as well.  These things all work the exact same way as the ice skating example.  Forces always come in pairs - without exception.  There is also another concept very closely related to Newton's third law that applies in these examples as well and that is the conservation of momentum.  Within any arbitrary system, the combined momentum of all parts of that system will remain constant.   First off, momentum is simply mass times velocity (p =mv).  Take a rocket.  The momentum of all that mass that makes up that rocket, and all the fuel inside that rocket - forever and ever will remain constant (unless it interacts with something outside our defined system).  Our defined system is just the rocket and all its fuel.  Suppose this rocket is just sitting in space stationary.  It's velocity is zero, ergo the momentum is zero.  The combined momentum of all that mass will always remain at zero.  Let's suppose our rocket has a mass of 10,000 kg.  This rocket fires up the engine and ejects 2,500 kg of mass at 500 m/s.  While all that fuel is no longer in the rocket, it's still part of our system, and the momentum of just the fuel is now 2,500 * 500 = 1,250,000 kg m/s.  Remember, the momentum of the system is conserved, so the remaining 7,500 kg of mass in the rocket must necessarily have a momentum of -1,250,000 kg m/s to offset the momentum of the ejected fuel to maintain the total momentum of zero.  Ergo, the rocket must be propelled in the opposite direction at v = p/m = -1,250,000 / 7,500 = 166.7 m/s.  The same logic can be applied to water shooting out of a hose or a bullet shooting out of a gun.  You can look at all these things from either a Newton's third law perspective or a conservation of momentum perspective.  They are two sides of the same coin.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "Ugxq7w2ePNBZxQqSPGJ4AaABAg", "comment": "I didnt understand it that well :(", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "UgzUPG11c-ho_9TLppp4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks a lot", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "UgxxgMyf-7XISNqrtQZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Gosh i think I learn more in YouTube than my teacher's stuffs thinks that she knows too much while she was fooling us around\"LOVE U YOU TUBE TEACHERS\"got to understand alot", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "UgyVtCot667AFhNF5QV4AaABAg", "comment": "I lost it at his 3rd law rip", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "UgyQjpep2lkLmVFOic14AaABAg", "comment": "It\u2019s very helpful", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "UgwLfbCtxhB_u0P20Zt4AaABAg", "comment": "Can anyone please explain, Why in the elevator problem  in both cases the tension forces is same ?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "kKKM8Y-u7ds", "cid": "UgwzBAyp09HW8rVgBkd4AaABAg", "comment": "Great Video!

They are considered mainstream only if their theories are based on phenomena.  Example: Gravity is considered a phenomenon. It is considered a phenomenon because we cant explain it. Because it doesn't work and it doesn't exist. If it did exist, we would certainly have discovered it by now. However, instead of making the Logical conclusion that we need a real Force. We continue for 200 years with this force. Gravity does not even explain Gravity.  Lot alone anything else in our universe.  We do not correct the error. What we do is add another phenomenon to explain the first phenomena such as dark matter. Then when that failed they created another phenomenal dark energy.  That is science now? You cannot use a phenomenon to explain the phenomenon that explains phenomena.  That it's not science under any circumstances or any definition. At best it is witches and Fantasies. This is why they're not finding the truth.
