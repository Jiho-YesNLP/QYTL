It is a method of momentarily focusing the listener's attention on theirself, to induce self-exam, and awareness of gaps, questions.  Since i happen to be an individual who is aroused in social interaction, mind enrapt with the info coming in, i , like you, feel that such filler noises are intrusions in both external and internal information flow, i tend to like concision in speech.  That IS  taught in speech class.  Instructors, however, ARE attentive to signaling from audience, and may be either seeing confusion & inattention, or needing more overt feedback, unsure if their lecture point is being absorbed.  Or, the 85% or so of humans caffeine-dependent (worldwide!) are slightly to highly hyperaroused, and consequently anxious as to whether they have correctly communicated. Early in life we may have been behaviorally influenced to be anxious, and are no longer attentive to our performance/delivery.
