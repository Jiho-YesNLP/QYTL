If the capacitance of the capacitor C is made large, then the fringe field does not build as fast as it would have if C were to be smaller. With a large C, the charge sprays on the plates do not result in developing a large voltage in a given interval of time as evident from the capacitor voltage-charge relation Q = CV. The fringe field is smaller and the net field consequently is greater. Therefore, at a fixed frequency, the current increases as the size of the capacitor is increased. Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two. To learn the operation of circuits it is instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos: i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and  ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail current in capacitor circuits and capacitive reactance.
