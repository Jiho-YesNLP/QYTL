Human's are opportunistic eaters who developed tools and used fire to survive in geographical areas that didn't provide fruit. Early hunter gatherers ate a small portion of animal food, mainly eggs and small animals such as birds, lizards and insects. The consumption of mollusks most likely helped assist with brain development, but the idea that humans come from a species that ate meat is really off base. Unlike a cougar, we do not possess the speed, agility, teeth, claws and specialized digestive system to bring down large prey and consume it. Most likely, the consumption of mollusks and cooked plant foods helped with brain development, which led to the development of hunting tools, cooperative hunting techniques, the use of dogs and other methods which allowed us to kill, process and consume game.

I know it seems hard to imagine but something you need to understand is that nothing is simple, the world we live in is so absurdly complex there are things the human mind cannot even comprehend, let alone understand. That doesn't mean we don't stop trying, however.\u00a0 Evolution is hard to explain to a lot of people without confusing them, but i think a better idea is to get a view of the mechanics of it before grasping the entire concept of evolution. First thing to note, evolution is not a random system, it has predicable patterns and can be observed pretty easily. Natural selection is a major mechanic of evolution and learning it helped me better understand it.  Natural selection occurs gradually as some genetic traits are made more or less common in an environment containing a population or 'selecting.' \u00a0Basically, when you have an animal that has a genetic mutation it can go several ways: one, it could do nothing and have no noticeable effect on its species thus not being selected for or against it. Two, it could be detrimental and cause defects or negative abnormality's that hinder it, thus reducing the likelihood of offspring.  Environments are constantly changing, and so some genetic abnormality's that seemed initially useless or even detrimental can be useful in some situations, giving the animal with the selected trait an advantage over the other variants and thus producing more offspring. Over long periods of time those initial minorities have become the dominant variant that continues to have genetic mutations that might be more, or less useful in a scenario. \u00a0 An example: If i have a bear with a brown coat give birth to a bear with a white coat due to a genetic mutation, the bear with the white coat won't be as effective in the forest as the brown bear, however if something changes (like the climate) and it becomes cold or food is short and the bears migrate to a colder climate with snow, then the bear with the white coat has an advantage. The animals with the advantage almost always create more offspring than those without it, so the bear thrives in its new environment and over time will become different enough from the brown bear to become a new species (through the process of speciation, look it up) and so you have a population of bears with white coats adapted to their environment.  I hope that helps you understand it a bit better, if not you can always learn.

Alien physiology most likely won't even be made up of DNA but something else entirely that i can't even imagine, so for alien worlds we can't really know if evolution works the same way it does on earth until we find them.  As for where DNA came from, well, i could spend an hour writing how early cells are theorized to have formed into RNA but i don't wanna mostly because i'm not a teacher and you could(and should if you're interested) study this on your own. Although, having someone explain some basic stuff is always helpful so...  Long and complicated story short, RNA came first and they handled all the jobs proteins and DNA did, copying itself, holding genetic code, metabolic functions, et cetera. Since the RNA-holding cells can self-replicate, they came under the effects of natural selection, creating variants of the replicating molecule that eventually was accidentally(i don't mean by random chance but more so the cell doesn't have any intelligent thought behind it, this is all chemical reactions) built in a way that had an even better chemical makeup and that variant would take over. Eventually, by natural selection, a stable system is formed.  In this primordial RNA world, RNA was pretty much supporting the early stages of life until some cells started using new molecules for other functions, enter DNA and proteins. DNA handled the genetic information and proteins kept the cell metabolic while RNA became the transcriber for the DNA to the protein factories in the cells.\u00a0  The cells would at some point become more and more focused on specific functions and multi-celled organisms like algae would start popping up, quickly becoming the dominant form of life.  This is all incredibly oversimplified but it's a good starting point to understanding how systems like this are formed.  It's not hard to find answers(the most simple being school education) for your questions on the internet, it does have the entire sum of all human knowledge contained on it after all, better than a textbook that's for sure.(though they do have their perks, a good one being you can trust a textbook better than random people on the internet.)

Basically the big bang explains how the universe came to existence (as in non-living matter, so yeah.. no explanation for life here), whereas the theory of evolution tries to explain how life became differentiated into various organisms from a single original organism (unicellular).  The theory of evolution has nothing to do with the formation of the planet or any other celestial body in space. Long story short, (big bang theory - how I understand it, experts feel free to correct me) there was a single tiny point of SUPER concentrated matter, which exploded and spat out all the matter in the universe. Think of this matter as dust. Since there is gravity, and all matter exerts gravity to a certain extent, this dust begins to clump together.  When this dust clumps together, they become larger and larger. The bigger the object = stronger gravity; stronger gravity = more dust getting pulled towards the big dust clump. This is basically how planets form.  As to why our planet has life, it is due to a metric butt ton of reasons and events. The Earth was initially like a ball of magma, and was even hit by a planet about the size of Mars, which caused some parts of this planet to fuse with the Earth and some of it to fly into orbit around the Earth, along with some bits of Earth as well - this became the moon. Eventually after A LOT of years, the Earth began to cool down. Earth got its water from comets, I think. (they have Ice, which melted or evaporated on Earth) I don't know, but yeah... LOTS and LOTS of comets. Earth is on the goldilocks zone, in the space where water can be in liquid form, just close enough to prevent freezing and far enough to prevent it from boiling. And as far as we know, liquid water is essential to life. There are more planets similar to earth which may support life  Just think of the odds. We are one planet in a solar system orbiting 1 star. There are about 1 billion stars in a galaxy. There are about 100 billion galaxies in the universe. We cant be the only planet supporting life.

To explain how this happens in an analogy, think of humans and apes/monkeys (I'm not saying that apes and monkeys are the same) as cousins in the same species, having the same grandparents, and the apes/monkeys stayed in  the place where their parents were born, whereas the humans migrated to an environment that had a lot of other animals competing for resources. The humans would develop, let's say, intelligence to counter the competition. In that environment, the smarter men would be more attractive to women, and the not as smart men would be less ideal. Thus, the smarter men would pass down their genes more, than the not as smart men. Eventually after generations, almost all people in the society or population are all composed of the men with the \"smarter gene\", since the not as smart men had less chances of passing on their \"not as smart gene\". This is NATURAL SELECTION. Eventually after millions of years, humans which had mutations allowing for larger brains - meaning more intelligence - meaning more offspring, would develop larger brains compared to their originally identical ape/monkey counterparts in their original homeland. Basically after millions of years of mutations and natural selection, the humans would become a different species from the apes/monkeys - this is EVOLUTION. Humans and apes are related, there is no doubting this, the genetic difference between individual humans today is about 0.1% on average - study of the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of about 1.2%.  Fourth, \"its funny how evolution has NO evidence\" is totally wrong. It's friggin happening before our eyes. Please do research prior to making claims such as evolution having no evidence. Read this: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060714-evolution.html Further more, fossils of early hominids are evidences of evolution, if you don't count our DNA being 98.8% identical to that of chimpanzees as evidence.   Fifth, indeed the Piltdown man was a hoax, but how about about the countless other finds of early Hominid fossils, such as A. ramidus and Lucy? Plus, the Piltdown Man was found in the early 18th century, you can't really blame them for not having a lot ways of finding out that it was a mix of contemporary human and ape bones. Further more, it was a skull, not just that of an early Hominid.  I'm not attacking your views on creationism. Just please, make sure to get your facts straight and do your research before making immature comments saying evolution is \"this impossible thing some 4 year old made up.\", not doing so simply makes you look much much less believable.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s06XzaKqELk", "cid": "UgjcE7pMJvsMpXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Tatf754FG46wBPy", "comment": "Lauren Cannon oh, but it did :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s06XzaKqELk", "cid": "UgjcE7pMJvsMpXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Tatf75Q48tSKYj7", "comment": "jackson marley +Lauren Cannon +RogueWave318\u00a0\u00a0\u201cScience without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\u201d Einstein worded it so perfect and is\u00a0exactly\u00a0how i feel about evolution and\u00a0religious beliefs, u need both in ur life and u cant do one without the other in my opinion :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s06XzaKqELk", "cid": "UgjcE7pMJvsMpXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Tatf75QaEwMFKww", "comment": "Legendkilleraaron\u00a0the bible is the only book that can tell history better than scientists.\u00a0", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s06XzaKqELk", "cid": "UgjcE7pMJvsMpXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Tatf75Uwg1HDGvp", "comment": "In evolution it's not by chance, it all makes sence.
