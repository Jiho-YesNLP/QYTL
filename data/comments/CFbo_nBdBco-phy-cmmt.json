Let's take the example from the video. 4kg ball moves towards the 2kg ball and touches it. 4kg ball exerts force on the second ball for some amount of time and the second also exerts force on the first (Newton's third law). During this, second ball will accelerate while the first is deaccelerating. At some moment they both will reach equal velocity. If they have equal velocities, they no longer exert force on each other. So, they will continue their motion with equal velocities.

An elastic collision is defined as a collision where net kinetic energy is conserved, therefore:  Ek1 + Ek2 = Ek1' + Ek2'.  This can be expanded to:  (1/2 x m1 x v1^2) + (1/2 x m2 x v2^2) = (1/2 x m1 x v1'^2) + (1/2 x m2 x v2'^2) Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by two to get:  (m1 x v1^2) + (m2 x v2^2) = (m1 x v1'^2) + (m2 x v2'^2).    Then, we subtract (m1 x v1'^2) from both sides of the equation to get:  (m1 x v1^2) + (m2 x v2^2) - (m1 x v1'^2) = (m2 x v2'^2) Then, we subtract (m2 x v2^2) from both sides to get:  (m1 x v1^2) - (m1 x v1'^2) = (m2 x v2'^2) - (m2 x v2^2)  Next, we group similar terms:  m1(v1^2 -\u00a0v1'^2) = m2(v2'^2 -\u00a0v2^2)    We can now go back to the pinned equation and, using substitution, replace m1 with (m2(v2' -\u00a0v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1')): (m2(v2' -\u00a0v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1')) x (v1^2 -\u00a0v1'^2) = m2(v2'^2 -\u00a0v2^2)  Now get rid of the extra brackets:  m2(v2' -\u00a0v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1') x (v1^2 -\u00a0v1'^2) = m2(v2'^2 -\u00a0v2^2)  Now divide both sides by m2:  (v2' -\u00a0v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1') x (v1^2 -\u00a0v1'^2) = (v2'^2 -\u00a0v2^2) Now divide both sides by (v1^2 -\u00a0v1'^2):  (v2' -\u00a0v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1') = (v2'^2 -\u00a0v2^2) / (v1^2 -\u00a0v1'^2) Now expand the squares:  (v2' -\u00a0v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1') = (v2' -\u00a0v2)(v2' + v2) / (v1 -\u00a0v1')(v1 + v1') Now multiply both sides by (v1 -\u00a0v1'):  (v2' -\u00a0v2) = (v2' -\u00a0v2)(v2' + v2) / (v1 + v1') Now divide both sides by (v2' -\u00a0v2):  1 = (v2' + v2) / (v1 + v1') Finally, multiply both sides by (v1 + v1'):  (v1 + v1') = (v2' + v2)  Get rid of the brackets:  v1 + v1' = v2' + v2  This can be rearranged to:  v1 + v1' = v2 + v2'  Thx for listening to my TED Talk", "votes": "897", "replies": "50", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CFbo_nBdBco", "cid": "UgyCb3uLsHzV6aRfe_t4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks so much.
