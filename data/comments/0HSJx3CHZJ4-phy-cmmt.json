I do have a question. If the lever is balanced horizontally on the fulcrum, and a small amount of additional weight is applied to one side, what determines how quickly that side will fall to the bottom and what relative amount of weight is required to partially or fully unbalance it. An analogy would be a playground see-saw. Consider one person on each side of exactly the same weight. If you add a pound to one person the equilibrium shift but perhaps only a few degrees. If you add 10 lbs to one side it may be sufficient to cause the opposite site to coast slowly to the ground. Addition of 100 lbs will cause the side to plummet to the ground like a heavy stone. Is there some way to calculate it. In my case I am trying to design a simple lever that will maximize the weight required to allow the extra load to cause the lever to drop around 20 degrees and not fully collapse the side. I hope that makes sense.
