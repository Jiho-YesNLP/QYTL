On the comprehension test 24 and 90 was easier with shown method. But with the 72 and 168 it was easier for me with the Euclidean. For the 21 and 111 Euclidean was easier because it was kinda hard to figure out 3 * 37 and then finding out that 37 is a prime! The last one was very fast and easy with Euclid method!
