That's what we are talking about today! @04:10     - We Still  don't know what the actual wavefunction means.... Physically.... @19:05     - QuantumDots @  1. The 1st Quantum Number  ====                   (Principle QN/ Shell)                  ==== ORBIT a.k.a Main Energy-Level @  2.

Thats what it Tells us @31:45    - And explaining why atoms are different, Remember that was our goal.... We needed to go Quantum to answer that @32:15  4.
