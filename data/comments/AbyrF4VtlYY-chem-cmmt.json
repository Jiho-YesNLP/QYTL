Giving fulgurites.  Sand, granular.. different vibrating pattern ..not Chladni. See surface tension on Numberphile..extra. No derivatives there.  So how, instant lightning gives that glassy resonant form?!  I think of nano nucleation, cleaRing, of biFurCaViTation 4.7, of bubbles, holes, pores, genus, and cones, sections. .. sand particles ice ocurring ball, hail, sometimes 2 concentric circles... hexa poles of 2 streams, flows, layers as on Saturn.  Reminds of how we cast iron into steel. Stal is steel. Synonyme.  Also chemical chaotic amorphous  bonding uses knots. Those aren't tabulated yet. But they can give more strenght to any material.   NonRUSTing (crust , resting) iron is a thing. Etalon has oxidation. But this one don't. Vacuum won't help. Bacteria film won't help. Those are some ancient secrets.
