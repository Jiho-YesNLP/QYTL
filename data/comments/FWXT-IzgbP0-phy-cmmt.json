E(Potential) = E(Kinetic)   We then calculate potential energy E(Potential) = 0.5 * m * h = 0.5 * 9.8 * 0.42 E = 2.058 N   With this value of potential energy, we know that is the kinetic energy at the bottom as described before. We can now plug this value into the kinetic energy formula where we can then solve for velocity. E(kinetic) = mv^2 2.058 = 0.42 * v^2 2.058 / 0.42 = v^2 v = 2.2ms-1 (2 s.f)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "Ugw4I-v4DY6f3BB_viN4AaABAg.9M9bB02KVuI9MBT5vSinoT", "comment": "https://youtu.be/GO0wb4MhYTg", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "Ugw4I-v4DY6f3BB_viN4AaABAg.9M9bB02KVuI9MGvJMl0mC3", "comment": "\u00a0@rxpe\u00a0 thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "Ugw4I-v4DY6f3BB_viN4AaABAg.9M9bB02KVuI9NYilPZNCkK", "comment": "Jeff L wrong, PE=mgh", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "UgyPZtU7glJ-A9UZZnp4AaABAg.9M9Y_T7UDH39MBSzbhyUSP", "comment": "https://youtu.be/XwSNYQVwnW4", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "UgxP8acLgVoNnPE0tgt4AaABAg.9M9X55EIfAv9MBT0OHq4ue", "comment": "https://youtu.be/XwSNYQVwnW4", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "UgyZGDbKDx3hyL3xdbV4AaABAg.9M9WvTI4UFb9MBT-SU0wQ-", "comment": "https://youtu.be/XwSNYQVwnW4", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "UgwIJMBBpTv9Y8tSEhN4AaABAg.9M9VJaM0hIO9Wqo1vvmmZO", "comment": "I am not sure if you found a book, but take a look at some Pearson textbooks, the year 11 physics pearson textbooks has helped me a lot, and the year 12 physics pearson textbook has some great motion stuff that relates to this topic.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FWXT-IzgbP0", "cid": "UgwIJMBBpTv9Y8tSEhN4AaABAg.9M9VJaM0hIO9XBBH0yU_c5", "comment": "Do you guys have any account that has subscribed to his channel on Patreon?
