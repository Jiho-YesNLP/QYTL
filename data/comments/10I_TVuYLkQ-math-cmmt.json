When you plug in -1-e in the original equation, squaring the negative value will still yield positive answer. For example, (-1)^2=1 and 1^2=1. In case you didn\u2019t see the properties of logarithms of the even powers, it would be ln(x+1)^2=2ln(abs(x+1)). abs stands for absolute value. The absolute value is there because the value can be negative at that value. If there\u2019s no absolute value there, it would make the answer undefined.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpg9KRAbQT_V6s", "comment": "log\u2082(-1) = log\u2082(-1\u00d71)=log\u2082(-1)+log\u2082(1) log\u2082(-1)+log\u2082(-4)=log\u2082(-1\u00d7-4)=log\u2082(4)=2  log\u2082(-1)+log\u2082(-4)= log\u2082(-1)+log\u2082(1) + log\u2082(-1)+log\u2082(4) = log\u2082(-1\u00d7-1)+log\u2082(1)+log\u2082(4)=2", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpg9Kv71B6ML89", "comment": "Hie to my teacher", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpg9Qw1VlbHaQ-", "comment": "I guess it is kind of randomly asking but does anybody know of a good website to watch new series online?", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpg9Qw3PKAYw7c", "comment": "@Hassan Ruben I dunno I would suggest Flixportal. you can find it on google =) -kyng", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpg9Qw5Ab4TDKH", "comment": "@Kyng Ronin thanks, I went there and it seems like a nice service =) Appreciate it!!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpg9ckl3RcjT_T", "comment": "\u00a0@hassanruben1019\u00a0 Sir, this is a McDonalds.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "10I_TVuYLkQ", "cid": "Ugxqcumr-ubirGCEYiB4AaABAg.90yJzwFeWpgA6l_vNk3uNV", "comment": "Try to show  most  of your  working professor.

Log(1) = x is asking you to find what number, if the base 10 was raised by this number, would be equal to 1? By the laws of exponents, any number raised to 0 will equal 1. Any base log will do the same. Log3(1) =0, log999(1) = 0.   The answer to the third question, log(3x-2) = 1, has nothing to do with that rule. The 1 is already equal to the left side of the equation, the question is not asking you to find out what log(1) = x is.  In the third question, we can express the 1 on the right as log(10), so it has the same base as the left side. Because log10(10) is equal to one, log(10) can be substituted for 1. To confirm that, solve log10(10) = x, which is asking by what number 10 needs to be raised by to equal 10. 10^1 = 10, so the answer is 1.  Then we have log(3x-2) = log(10). As we have log on both sides, they can be cancelled out, leaving 3x-2 = 10. Balance by adding 2 to both sides. 3x = 12. Divide by 3. X = 4.
