Also , i learn how heredity followed particular patterns which Gregor Mendel discovered. He used pea plants to see if traits got passed on and which didn\u2019t. In addition i learned what classical genetics is which is a branch of genetics based solely on visible results of reproductive acts. What i also  learn is that some plants have polyploid in them which is when they have more than 2 sets of chromosomes in each cell. One thing that i thought was important in this video is how everything adds up together. For example traits are described by the genetic information carried by a molecule called DNA. Then a gene is a hereditary unit consisting of DNA which occupies a spot on a chromosome which then determines a characteristic in an organism", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgyYsILj3pkkEpqtLPF4AaABAg", "comment": "april 22 2020 biology class and im still watching this video from 2012. thank you ! it has been great help !", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgyaopDElxafch6ThJx4AaABAg", "comment": "\"Im definitely getting that VIBE from you\"", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgyoUSl1-KZ9iCPZj4d4AaABAg", "comment": "This, is better than watch an hour long video from knah academy.Seriously ,i fall asleep every  time watching those videos and learn nothing afterwards.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgwFplFoXZMiyaInMEF4AaABAg", "comment": "lol \"im doing you a favor\"lol!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "Ugx0o4rGYEmrSyQyQzt4AaABAg", "comment": "who are you more like:John or Hank? comment down below", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "Ugz4VnceQseikANShBR4AaABAg", "comment": "Dude, Johan Gregor Mendel was not Austrian...", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgwIu-oPImkKRDqmvkt4AaABAg", "comment": "2012 huh, 6 years past. 2020 is horrorable!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgzBvX80NU3HqghK3PF4AaABAg", "comment": "John is a mood", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgxMqwZdfWek5Od9AIF4AaABAg", "comment": "Okay!

Say you have alleles A and B and assume they follow the Mendelian pattern of inheritance (with no bullcrap like masking or complementation or w/e). Say you have two parents, both with an AaBb genotype. You want to find out the probabilities (or ratios) of each kid having a certain phenotype.   Sex linked genetics are when you have a trait present in one of the sex chromosomes. The only one I can think of is eye color in fruit flies. Say you have a wild type trait, W, which codes for red eyes, and a recessive mutant, w, which codes for white eyes. The allele is present on the X chromosome but not on the Y. So if you have a female fly (XX) with the genotype, Ww, it'll have red eyes. If you have a male (XY), it'll only have the genotype w because the gene is not present on the Y chromosome.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "Ugicc7KgWMWp_3gCoAEC.8ApGpQE6hwJ8AvJanEK9hB", "comment": "+nasraah mohamed I hate your mum.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "Ugicc7KgWMWp_3gCoAEC.8ApGpQE6hwJ8Axf3hS-SoD", "comment": "+Oscar Pearce I hate u bitch", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8FHrLSwW1iR", "comment": "dont be so mean to yourself you look nice\u263a", "votes": "92", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8JCRWN7FAeT", "comment": "u r flirting with her now", "votes": "47", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8JJYIb6X2xE", "comment": "He's just being nice", "votes": "148", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8PxJ8d1YDne", "comment": "too funny", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8Vy6t8DHwtd", "comment": "Your profile pic of yourself looks really pretty.", "votes": "19", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8Ynj-inPAuN", "comment": "lol spongebob?", "votes": "21", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8hPJIRjKcRj", "comment": "chellooza SAME", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8iIiIqDHGBc", "comment": "Lol just so you know, there are men that will kill for a girl like you.", "votes": "20", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8kaAjowQHL7", "comment": "Shut up, you are cute", "votes": "10", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8ob86ewSNeJ", "comment": "always", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8omFiOA1EaM", "comment": "RIP Steven Hillenburg", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8opdnoXPlrm", "comment": "I feel like throwing tomatoes at my parents sometimes", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CBezq1fFUEA", "cid": "UgjFkY6eznvEJXgCoAEC.8Ank1eNJanF8qAL3yPXSF2", "comment": "Is it just me or have you ever just looked at the parents of a very pretty girl and wondered... \"how did they do it?
