No idea how correct they were though. Found readings to be a bit excessive and problem sets a bit discouraging to solve. Answers to problems would have been nice I think. 2. As for material presentation: Number theory - the part that I I joined the least. Counting & probability. I felt like I needed a lot more exercises to try myself to get used to concepts.
