(2x^2 y^4 z^5) ^3 -- As you recall, when cubing elements with exponent we simply multiply. So 2 cubed is 8, x^2 cubed is x^6, y^4 cubed is y^12, and z^5 cubed is z^15.  2. Remember that because the exponent is negative, we get rid of it by inverting the fraction. So now we have (x^2y over xy^2) squared. We multiply the exponents, yielding X^4 Y^2 over X^2 Y^4. That cancels to give us X^2 over Y^2.  3. Let's substitute Y=3, chosen at random. X^ (6+1) over X^(6-1) gives us X^7 over X^5. Cancel out, and we're left with X^2.  4. Good golly Dave, way to crank up the difficulty! This is just mean.  Okay, remember that the \"2\" in the exponent is also a 2/1. So now we can multiply the exponents. X^1/3 by 2/1 gives X^2/3. The other term, X^2/3s multiplied by 2/1 gives us X^4/3s. So now we have X^2/3 times X^4/3 divided by X^3/2.  Now we go ahead and multiply X^2/3 by X^4/3, which means we add the numerators, giving us X^6/3. (which is the same as X-squared, but in this case we'll convert it to X^4/2, a common denominator.) Now when we divide X^4/2 by X^3/2, we subtract the numerators, yielding X^1/2. Whew!  (At least I think that's how it works.

Basically the inverse operation of y^2 or y squared would be to get the squared root so instead of (16\u20222)y^2 you can do the square root of 16 and 2. This looks like /16 \u2022 /2... 4 is the square root of 16 so that's where the 4 comes from and /2 or square root of 2 comes from.   You leave the square root of 2 looking as is because if you solved for that number you will get a long repeating number that'll make the while equation look ugly. You want your equation to be simple aka simplified so that's why you dont solve for it. Anyways, now your equation should look something like 4y\u2022/2. The reason the 4 gets a y and not the 2 is because you solved for y by using the square root! Because you can't get a whole number by solving for the square root of 2 aka /2 you leave it there alone, no y because that was the whole point of doing the square root. Remember the inverse operation of a variable squared is to find the square root and vice versa.

Thanks so much for replying by the way, you're amazing. I'm currently studying for the GAMSAT (MCAT for Australia and the UK) and your channel has helped me so much (ive been watching heaps of your chem videos too). I'm currently doing my masters in medical research, and so I have a pretty good grasp of science as a whole, but my mathematics is so lacking it's embarrassing. There's so many little rules like this that accumulate into a solid understanding of mathematics (regretting not trying harder in highschool every day) and unfortunately it doesn't seem like there are an shortcuts. Would you have any recommendations/sources, apart from going topic by topic, where someone a little further on in their careers can go and practice the basics?

And I think this is the first maths one I've watched so I will definitely continue. I've been using tutorial videos to study for many years now and honestly I've only found your channel recently. At the moment I actually prefer your stuff over Khan academy or others because you start simple (for people like me) but still extend the concepts to their complexity which is where you actually start realistically applying them, and your comprehension section at the end is great. Also your intro jingle is dope. Thanks again dave, i honestly can't  express how much people including myself appreciate the work people like you do.
