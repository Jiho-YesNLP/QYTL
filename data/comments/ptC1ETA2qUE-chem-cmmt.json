To obtain the energy balance, the extraction work Wex is added to the equation. Something that is a subsequent effect of the interaction of the photon with the electron in the metal. The mechanism of the photoelectric effect is based on an electric impulse of induction that occurs during the rapid damping of the standing wave, of high amplitude, constituted by the constructive interference of the wave titles from the component of the wave packet of the incident photon in the metal. The high-amplitude wave of the photon refracted in the metal appears after the contraction of the photon both longitudinally and transversally and its refraction at 360 degrees, in the atomic environment, of high energy density. The stationary wave, of high amplitude, propagates on the circle of the Rfm metal photon radius, with a speed of C/137 (m/s) and behaves like an elementary electric charge, which produces a current in the coil. When the high-amplitude standing wave breaks, the electric impulse appears, through electromagnetic induction, which accelerates the electron in the immediate vicinity.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ptC1ETA2qUE", "cid": "UgwP1iGT5XIDd39uZwJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Great camera and great explanations\u2764!", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ptC1ETA2qUE", "cid": "UgyJmHto8I91nUixF494AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks for making science more fun!
