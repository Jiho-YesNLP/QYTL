The term \"species\" is almost an arbitrary statement, it is to take an arbitrary line of the casual chain and call it something because it makes sense in comparision to our immediate surroundings. Today we know a lot more about biology than what we did when the named the species, so we look back at the term \"species\" and realise that it is more or less an arbitrary term, so we came up with a definition for it, and that is: \"two individuals that can mate and procude fertile offspring\", this defintion is however very loose. In certain cases the following principle is true: Population A is able to have fertile offpsring with Population\u00a0B and Population\u00a0C, however, Population\u00a0B can not have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0C, it can however have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0D, Population\u00a0D can however not have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0A, yet, it can have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0E, Population\u00a0E can however not have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0B, it can however have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0F, Population\u00a0F can however not have fertile offspring with Population\u00a0D, but it can however have fertile offspring with Population G, I can continue to make an infinite series out of this, but unfortunately I do not have the time. Now, do we say that Population\u00a0A is the same species as Population G? Most certainly not, yet, both of them can have fertile offspring with a population that can have fertile offspring with a population than can have fertile offspring with a population that can have fertile offspring with a population that can have fertile offspring with Population A. In other words: is then Population A and Population B the same species? Well, they can both have fertile offspring with each other, yet Population A can have offspring with with Population C, and Population B can not, Population B can have fertile offspring with Population D, so where do we draw the line for what a species is here?
