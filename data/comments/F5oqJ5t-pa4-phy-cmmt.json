The reason why online learning seems more effective than traditional classes is because, in school or college, we often find ourselves goofing around with our peers, being too shy or scared to ask back questions or any of our doubts, the lack of revisions after classes, and lacking the necessary attention span.   If you start disliking a teacher, your brain just automatically shuts itself up and doesn't bother listening to him/her which creates an endless cycle where you struggle to grasp even basic concepts, despite the teacher's decent lecture.\r \r On the other hand, online learning fosters a greater willingness to learn. When you come home and realize there's an upcoming exam, the urgency kicks in. A quick YouTube search leads you to reliable channels teaching the same concepts taught in school. The key difference lies in the pre-planned and organized nature of online lectures. They are shorter, concise, and to the point.\r \r Moreover, your attentiveness is heightened because you know this is your last resort. Your brain becomes more capable of comprehending topics that seemed challenging during in-person classes due to a lack of concentration or fatigue.  I am pretty sure, people may find \"Organic Chemistry Tutor's\" teachings to be more challenging to learn and comprehend at a live-irl-class than on YouTube.  \r So, the moral of the story is that you should always rely on yourself, in this case, through self-study with a guide, rather than depending solely on others. Actively participating in your own learning allows you to grasp more information. In school, there's often a lack of interest, making it challenging to absorb the material effectively.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "F5oqJ5t-pa4", "cid": "Ugznwd9PL4qBRCTkUbZ4AaABAg.9gK1V9dMfmx9xc-rJDzBns", "comment": "(1)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "F5oqJ5t-pa4", "cid": "Ugy-pyLlMxl50NAEDKt4AaABAg.9gA9EWu3k9l9imPn2pB9XE", "comment": "You use cosine when you are dealing with x direction while sin is for y direction", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "F5oqJ5t-pa4", "cid": "UgybUedgwXGK12D9Rxd4AaABAg.9fMIFwVLHZbA7o4BFSGfcV", "comment": "True and me", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "F5oqJ5t-pa4", "cid": "UgxOvsNbQLjJAbKYHZF4AaABAg.9eGQFNXt-9j9jWu5c4Pe6N", "comment": "yes i was thinking that too.
