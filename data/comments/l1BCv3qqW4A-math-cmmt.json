But given the results aren't mutually independent, and the \"best\" we can assume is pairwise independence. Our goal is to prove OJ was indeed the murderer.  Since we can assume pairwise independence, what would be the \"best\" indicator that OJ is guilty. That is to say what pair of M's would have the least possibility that the blood was matched to some perpetrator other than OJ.   We know that: Pr(M1,M2,M3) <= Pr(M i ,    M j) for the relevant i's and j's (which are 1,2,3).  So as you have calculated, 1/20 is a valid \"lower\" bound. This implies that there is a 5% chance that OJ is innocent (null hypothesis). In contrast, the 1/50 pair implies that he is innocent only at a 2% chance. In other words, the upperbound comes from the (alternate) hypothesis that proves OJ is guilty with 98% probability as an \"upper bound\".
