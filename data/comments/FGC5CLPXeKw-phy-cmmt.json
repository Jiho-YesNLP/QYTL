Understanding the concepts is key to getting an intuitive sense of what the concepts mean, so that we understand what we want to do when we do calculations. Thank you very much again!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FGC5CLPXeKw", "cid": "UgwNRFOmXiJ7B0RBKTF4AaABAg", "comment": "I just want to say thank you for this video, I\u2019m currently in a physics 1 class in college, and have been struggling to understand key concepts in physics, it\u2019s currently Saturday, and I have an exam Tuesday and was worried because I didn\u2019t understand this stuff, only 8 minutes into the video, and you\u2019ve answered so many of the questions I\u2019ve had so far. Just wanted to comment, because you relate to my struggles, and find a way to explain what\u2019s going on in a way I understand. Just the example where you are relating moment of inertia to mass, I didn\u2019t understand inertia at all, but now feel I have a base to build off of. This video is what\u2019s going to help me start to understand rotational motion in a way I couldn\u2019t before.
