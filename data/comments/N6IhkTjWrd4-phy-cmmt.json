That is just a bad explanation. I like your videos but some of your explanations are sometimes bad and sometimes just wrong. \"ay\" per this convention is negative and MUST stay negative. You cannot just say let's make it positive to match \"ax\". Acceleration is a vector!  Changing its sign makes it opposite of \"ax\" which is just wrong! Sum of Fy=-aym2 . You don't just pick one or the other. \"ay\" is negative so Fy must be negative. All checks out. To clarify \"ax\" and \"-ay\" being the same, you explain that their change of direction is a result of the pulley changing their orientation by 90 degrees CW. If you reverse the 90 degree orientation, they are still the exact same acceleration, that being \"ax\". They have same magnitude and both point to the right. They both have the same magnitude and direction when the orientation is reverted back 90 CCW! A positive \"ay\", as you claim to have chosen, if the orientation was rotated CCW by 90 degrees would yield an \"ay\" that is opposite \"ax\". In other words it would yield a \"-ax\" acceleration.  You can't just say \"let's pick '-m2ay' \" as your Fy. You have to be able to justify it. It is precisely that because you multiply \"-ay\" times m2. End of story. The problem is done right but your explanations are just plain wrong. Sorry but I've noticed you have a tendency to explain things wrong. It's like you know what to do by virtue of memory but you don't know the reasons behind it. Sorry to call you out, but you can't teach people like this.

Read my comment on that video.  Yes, it can be done stated as he does, because it will yield the same result, but it is an incorrect interpretation of the integration here. The idea with this integration is to treat the rope as infinitely small dx's of rope and each will be pulled up a distance X. Upon summing(integrating) all these infinitely small changing work, one will arrive at the total work done on the rope. For this reason, your force is dx(tiny piece of rope) * the density of your rope. This will yield you the weight of the dx piece of rope which is your force due to gravity. The work you do on this dx piece of rope is the same as what gravity does; it's just in the opposite direction. W = FD and D in this case, is X, the distance that each tiny dx has to move to get to the top.

It does not and will NEVER match if your coventions are left and down are negative and right and up are positive. If your sign coventions were changed to reflect down being positive and up being negative, then yes, their signs would match and it would be Ay, not -Ay. The issue is he cleary doesn't understand that acceleration is a vector, therefore it has both a magnitude and a direction. Ax and -Ay have the same magnitude but their directions are clearly NOT the same. Ax moves to the right while -Ay moves down. Their sign tells us which direction they are moving and nothing more. Our covention is that down is negative so an acceleration downward would be negative. To determine if the object would move down or up after the pulley, just straighten out the line after the pulley by rotating it 90 CCW. This will form a straight horizontal path. Ax is acceleration to the right so after the pulley it must continue to move to the right! But because the pulley changes the direction by rotating it 90 degrees CW, a right acceleration (Ax) will yield a downward acceleration -Ay. What he doesn't comprehend is that what stays the same is the magnitudes of Ay and Ax. Their directions will NEVER match in this convention. You can visibly see one is to the right and one is down therefore the signs(direction) of the accelerations will NEVER be the same unless your conventions were changed to up being negative and down being positive. This is how one should read these vectors: Ax = magnitude is A and sign is positve indicating direction is to the right -Ay = magnitude is A and sign is negative indicating direction is down  \"A\" by itself is just a scalar; it has no sense of direction at all. It's just an acceleration which is positive by the way.  We give it a direction by multiplying it by \"+1\" or \"-1\", the coeficients of our unit vectors. Remember unit vectors \"i hat\" and \"j hat\" , your  unit vectors in the X and Y axis respectively? Because we donote Ax, we already know it's in the X axis so we just need to multiply by \"+1\" or \"-1\" which tells us to the right or left. In the Y axis, they tell us down or up.

Note that the two tension forces are the forces the two masses exert on one another. The tension force at M2 is the force M1 exerts on M2 and the tension force at M1 is the force M2 exerts on M1. These forces are equal and opposite so they actually cancel out. The pulley just redirects the force of M2 at 90 degrees. If you imagine rotating everything after the pulley CCW 90 degrees, you see that the tension force on M2, M2, and M2g all lie in a straight line with respect to M1 and the tension force at M1. Also notice that now, the tension force at M2(force of M1 on M2) opposes the tension force at M1(force of M2 on M1). Because these two cancel each other out, you have an Fnet  that is acting on both of these masses, that being, M2g. This tells you, M2g = a (M1+M2). Solve for a and you get, a = M2g/(M1+M2). Once you have this, it's easy to solve for T as is noted here on the video as T is the force accelerating M1 while the force accelerating M2 is equal to T-m2g. The take away you should get from this is that since the tension force in the rope is the same, but in opposite directions, they cancel out and you are left with two different masses being accelerated by Fnet(M2g). Since they both have the same acceleration (connected by a 100% static rope is the assumption), per Newton's second law, F=ma, each of these different masses must be experiencing a different Fnet given the fact they even though they have different masses, they are accelerating at the same rate. The only way this is possible is if each were accelerated by two different net forces, Fnet1(net force acting on M1) and fnet2(net force acting on M2). Note, these two net forces are not the same as the net force M2g. Remember, M2g is the net force acting on (M2+M1...imagine M2 & M1are fused together as one single large mass). It accelerates them both(imagine one large mass) and from this acceleration, we can determine the individual net forces acting on each of the masses. This is the takeaway one should get from this pulley problem. The answer is meaningless if you don't understand what's happening and why.
