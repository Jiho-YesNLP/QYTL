Generally speaking, it is preferable to expand numerators, and factor denominators. This helps put your expressions in the most calculus-friendly form.  Consider: 6*(x + 2)*(x + 3)/(x^3 + 10*x^2 + 29*x + 20) \r You could take a derivative of the original expression without simplifying it, it will be tedious to do so.  To integrate it without preprocessing, is impossible.  I deliberately set it up, to factor with no removable factors.  The denominator factors as: (x + 1)*(x + 4)*(x + 5).  Expanding the top, and factoring the bottom, you get: (6*x^2 + 30*x + 36)/[(x + 1)*(x + 4)*(x + 5)]  There is an algebraic trick to simplify it further, so it is much more calculus-friendly, called partial fractions.   Set up the solution in the form of; A/(x + 1) + B/(x + 4) + C/(x + 5)  Equate to the original expression, match corresponding terms, and solve an equation system for A, B, and C.  For simple linear factors, Heaviside coverup works as a shortcut.  To find A, cover up (x + 1), and let x = -1 to make the covered-up term equal zero.  Evaluate what remains of the original expression, to find A. at x = -1: A = 6*((-1)^2 + 5*-1 + 6)/[(-1 + 4)*(-1 + 5)] = 1  I'll leave it as practice for you to find the others, which are B = -4 & C = 9.  This means the expression is: 1/(x + 1) - 4/(x + 4) + 9/(x + 5)  Now it looks MUCH simpler, and easier to use for calculus.  It's now a simple case of the power rule and trivial case of the chain rule for differentiation.  And for integration, it's just natural log saving the day, at the special case where the reverse power rule fails.  The derivative: -1/(x + 1)^2 + 4/(x + 4)^2 - 9/(x + 5)^2  And the integral: ln(|x + 1|) - 4*ln(|x + 4|) + 9*ln(|x + 5|) + C (this C has nothing to do with the C from earlier)", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "KfrkcGx2Xl8", "cid": "UgwXApFOtIkLJ6dM1HR4AaABAg.9vwNZcbJ0ZP9wnN1oX40nx", "comment": "\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 thanks!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "KfrkcGx2Xl8", "cid": "UgwXApFOtIkLJ6dM1HR4AaABAg.9vwNZcbJ0ZP9zSvY0Q7BPJ", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 u saved someone lives again", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "KfrkcGx2Xl8", "cid": "UgxkBf6_khGvikt9DfN4AaABAg.9thqB3GpHBi9wh5HEITaMT", "comment": "Historical reasons.

With calculators, it is no longer as much of an issue, because 1/sqrt(2) is just as easy to enter into a calculator as sqrt(2)/2.

For calculus applications, it's preferred to have single factors in each denominator, instead of a product of factors.  Since the degree on the top is 2, and the degree on the bottom is also 2, we can expand it so it becomes a stand-alone constant, and a sum of partial fractions if we want.  Dave has a video on partial fractions, but he doesn't cover my preferred shortcut, Heaviside Coverup.\r \r In this case, it helps us, to look at the original given form.  Had you been given the single solid fraction we just derived, you can expand the denominator, and manipulate the numerator so you can form a term we can cancel.  This brings it to the form:\r 3*(x^2 + 3*x - 10)/(x^2 + 3*x - 10) - 21*x/[(x-2)(x + 5)]\r \r Which allows us to cancel common factors in the first term and get:\r 3 - 21*x/[(x-2)(x + 5)]\r \r Partial fractions and Heaviside cover-up, can simplify it from here.\r \r For us, let's look back at the original form:\r 3*x/(x + 5) - 6/(x - 2)\r \r The second term is already as simplified as we can get it.  The first term, has a linear term on top of a linear term.  We can manipulate it, to form a term we can cancel, by adding zero in a fancy way:\r 3*x/(x + 5) = 3*(x + 5 - 5)/(x + 5) = 3*(x+5)/(x+5) - 15/(x + 5)\r \r Construct complete form, equal to the original expression:\r 3 - 15/(x + 5) - 6/(x - 2)  Now, we have the factors untangled from each other.

Mathologer has an excellent video on making sense of the cubic formula.  Usually, if you're working with a cubic or quartic in an academic example, it will be deliberately set up to have rational roots, and you can find them with the rational roots theorem.  Given any polynomial in the form of: a*x^n + b*x^(n - 1) + ... (other terms) ... + k  Its roots will add to -b/a, and multiply to k/a for even polynomials, and multiply to -k/a for odd polynomials.   This means, roots of the polynomial will be (integer factors of k)/(integer factors of a), and knowing the two properties above will help narrow them down from those options.  Once you positively identify one rational root, you can use polynomial division to reduce the polynomial to a lower degree.
