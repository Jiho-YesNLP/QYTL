If you don`t have the information about the thing that you will create you cannot create. When evolutionists said that it happened coincidentally they say that the atoms or causes have the information of the creature that happens after all of the processes that caused the emergence of the creature.  Another example, animals where do they get from the information for sucking blood without causing any problem or how do bees get the knowledge of making honey, or how did cows learn to make milk? I don`t think nature has the knowledge of making those things. Those things are so unique things and as human beings we need them. Also, they are proper for our bodies.

THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION *The theory of evolution is  the, evolution is the idea that gene distribution changes over time, however the theory of evolution is a large set of ideas that integrate and explains a huge mass of observations from different sciences from palaeontology to anatomy. Thus the theory of evolution explains many things that we as humans have seen and observed for thousands of years, it\u2019s the theory that precisely explains how all life on earth is so diversely complex and different.\r*  EVIDENCE 1: FOSSILS *Fossil record shows that organisms living long ago were different from those we see today. When scientists first discovered dinosaurs they thought they were all giant iguanas, however it wasn\u2019t until the dinosaurs with 2 legs started coming up that scientists had to grapple with he fact that organisms from the past where somewhat similar to animals today, however they have al gone extinct therefore they must have evolved to survive and be the animals we see today. Another example is how scientists found out Whales used to walk, they first found an old fossil that in fact had vestigial leg bones that fell into the same category of whales, then they later found an older fossil that had whole legs, as well as a pelvis, however the pelvis wasn\u2019t fused to the backbone therefore still swam like a whale. In addition this fossil still had ankle bones that were in turn unique to the same family that included pigs, hippos, bison and deer.\r*  EVIDENCE 2: HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES *Homologous structures are the structures of our bones and things for example the difference between this human arm and bat arm, they both have the Exact same structures that you can see is colour coded with a long bone at the hinge, 2 smaller thin bones connecting to the hands, which has a group of smaller grouped together bones, then the fingers. Although all organisms will be using their limbs for  different purposes, due to the very similar structure, we can see how really close we are. This is the same for DNA/RNA, all living things on earth has DNA and/ or RNA, the fact that we all use the same molecules shows how alike we all are. However, if we look into  the sequencing of a species DNA we can see how really related we are.\r*  EVIDENCE 3: BIO-GEOGRAPHY *When it comes to species that are very related to each other and their distribution around the world is explained very well by the evolution.  Animals that are the most similar tend to be found in the same regions, because evolutionary change is driven by geographical change. When organisms are restrained and separated by rivers or mountains, they take their own evolutionary courses. However, in this type of time period we are talking about, change happens over a much larger period of time, and it is in fact often due to continental drift. For example, the reason why Australia has kangaroos, Koalas, and many other unique animals, is because when Australia started breaking off and becoming it\u2019s own island all the animals that stayed o the mainland were killed off over the years whilst the animals that stayed on the Island slowly breaking away stayed alive becoming the animals we know in Australia today.\r*  EVIDENCE 4: *There are many things we have seen in our own lifetimes that are amazing examples one of the most common being the resistance to drugs and chemicals. In 1959 a study in India found that DDT killed 95% of mosquitoes on the first application, those that survived reproduced and passed on their genetic resistance to the insecticide. Within a year DDT was killing 40% of the mosquitoes and it continued to drop. We have also observed larger animals such as the Italian Wall Lizards, which were originally insect eaters, were moved from one island of the coast to the other. 30 years later, the immigrated Lizards have changed their entire digestive systems and effectively had made their own fermenting chambers to maximise energy and digested the islands main food source, plants.\r*  Hope this helps anyone attempting to create a PowerPoint or something that needs some sort of text to go off.

Left to themselves, all things in our universe will fade away into useless mush. Not even life can prevent it for long. ONLY an intellect can reverse the process of intentional construction. Not one incident of spontaneous generation of a complex organized system that has EVER been seen. With good reason. Its IMPOSSIBLE. And since this is more important to understand, i'll point out a common misconception that has fooled many an intelligent person into believing it HAS happened before. This subject is evolutionary theory, and more specifically, the difference between MACROevolition and MICROevolution. It's really easy if explained in simple terms. MACROevolution  is when a lower species gains complexity and develops into a higher species. MICROevolution is the scientific term for minor changes in organisms. It cannot change a species into a better one, but it can make changes that better suit the animal. I could describe more differences, but I don't have the time. in summery, MICROevolution uses genetic information ALREADY PRESENT in the animal to allow small changes in the animal's characteristics while MACROevolution depends on NEW INFORMATION forming by  accident. sometimes, an an information - losing mutation my give an animal a survival advantage over its peers, but MACROevolution depends upon having, not only a survival advantage, but also an increase in information and complexity. There's obviously a problem then. MACROevolution depends on blind chance. And I've learned that when things are left to chance ( according to the laws of the universe )  they have always become LESS complex, not MORE complex. In addition, MACROEVOLUTION HAS NEVER BEEN OBSERVED. Therefore, MACROevolution is a FICTION. Unfortunately, MICROevolution is often used to \"prove\" that MACROevolution is a FACT. Even the term MICROevolution is misleading. They are two very different ideas.

Every car they produce will have tires, windshields, side mirrors and the rest but they produce different models of cars, cars that all have the same features but are different. If you see two cars that look similar in design, its not far-fetched to think they were created by the same designer. They can design their cars however they want. Same thing with God, the creator. He creates animals and it doesnt prove that different kinds of organisms evolved from each other, he can design his creatures however he wants. Its absurd to think there would even be a missing link between them.

ERV markers are non coding sequences of DNA inserted into the genome of host organisms by viruses. These markers are inserted at random and are used by the virus to take over the cell and produce more viruses. Humans and chimps share 12 ERV markes that are in the same locations in both genomes and have the same content. The ONLY feasible way for this to happen is for our species to have a common ancestor that also had these 12 ERV markers. \r 2. Almost all mammals produce the Vitamin C they require. Humans have the gene to produce Vitamin C but there is a single bit error in the gene that renders it useless. The only other mammals that have this error are the members of the primate sub-order Haplorhini; Tarsiers, New World Monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World Monkeys (Catarrhini) including the family Hominidae (humans and other apes).\r 3. Most animals do not see in 3 colors. The gene that allows humans to see yellows, blues and reds is only found in one group of animals, primates of which we are a member species. Some 40 million years ago a gene duplication mutation occured doubling the OPN1MW gene sensitive to the yellow/green section of the light spectrum and a later mutation of this resulted in the OPN1LW gene that enables primates having this to see the color red. This mutation is unique to primates and as a primate, we too have this form of color vision.\r 4.Valid Scientific Theories can be used to make predictions. Darwin noted that the bones in the wings of birds resembled the fused finger bones of other animals so he predicted that fossil bird would be found with unfused finger bones. Less than 5 years later, archaeopteryx was found with feathers, a long bony tail like a dinosaur, teeth and unfused finger bones in the wing. \r 5. Dr Neil Shubin wanted to find the first fish that could crawl up onto land. Eusthenopteron of 385 million years ago was similar to the later Acanthostega of 365 million years ago but there was too much difference for there not to be an intermediate species so he looked for exposed sedimentary rock of the right type and age and found this in the Canadian Arctic on Ellesmere Island and found the intermediate species that was then named Tiktaalik. \r 6.The human and chimp genomes have been compared and the two are over 98% the same. More over, where there are differences the are those genes that enable brain development, different hair growth, language development. \r 7. The fact that new medicines have been tested on animals for side effects and efficacy shows that the underlying biological systems are biologically similar and therefore related however distantly. \r 8. Embryology hints at the Evolutionary history of species with snakes developing limb buds in the early stages of development that then get reabsorbed. We have the fossils of primitive snake that have vestigial legs that extend beyond the body of the snake and it is a regular \"birth defect\" in snakes to have non functioning legs.\r 9 Whales evolved over the past 55 million years from land animals. This is shown through the fossil record that start with Pakicetus that was identified as the precursor to the whale lineage by the presence of an S shaped bone in the skull of Pakicetus that is unique to whales as well as an unusual double tendon arrangement on the limbs of Pakicetus and is still found in the flippers of modern whales. Neither of these features are found in any other animals. It is also noted that by comparing the genomes of many species, the closest living relative of whales is the hippo, another aquatic mammal. \r 10.Genomes contain non functioning genes called pseudogenes. Mammals, including humans have the gene to produce egg yolk due to the fact that we evolved from egg laying ancestors some 100 million years ago. \r 11. Birds are descended from and are a living branch of dinosaurs. We have found many dinosaur fossils with the imprints of feathers preserved, even dinos that were too heavy to ever fly. Even the velociraptor of \"Jurassic Park\" fame has been shown to have the anchor points on the bone of its fore limbs of feathers indistinguishable from the same bumps found in eagles or geese. This case is further reinforced by the fact that chickens still have the DNA for a long bony tail like a dinosaur. \r 12. Characteristics of animals and plants are strictly divided by phylogeny. Only birds have gullets, feathers and beaks, features that have all been identified in dinosaurs. Only mammals have lactation glands and hair. Only reptiles and snakes of land animals are cold blooded. \r 13.

Interestingly, we can eaven test and see how they started in fresh water and slowly started living in saltwater, by testing isotopes we can know that indohyus and pakicetus lived in freshwater, ambulocetus lived in brackish waters, and kutchicetus and other more derived cetaceans lived in saltwater. And then Atavisms, as we can and have directly observed modern cetaceans with atavistic hindlimbs.

One of the biggest mistakes is the global flood story. In reality there was no global flood,it only occured in a certain area somewhere in the Middle East or East Asia and the proof for this is that the  ancient biblical Hebrew word translated to earth/world was 'Eretz' which actually trans*literates* to land and the reason why Noah's family was saved was because he and his family were the only remaining racially pure descendants of Adam as all others had intermixed with other races. Also Noah couldn't have had all of animal species present on this earth on his ark but he could've had all the species belonging to a certain area/region/land,hence the global flood is a total hoax but the actual flood occured.

Actually I've been trying to find the article where I read the true place of flood and if I find it sooner or later, I'd let you know. Now, you see my last comment was partially written and I intentionally missed out on some things because the truth is much more controversial than what I just wrote. Also the words you used to describe God are just a much exaggerated form of what he actually is(but he is along those lines)and to be more precise,read Galatians 4:16,Matthew 10:34-36 ,37, Matthew 7:21-23,Ezra 10:11,Romans 9:11-13,Mark 7:7,Mark 8:38 and then see how much of the modern values you uphold as \"good\" or \"ethical\" are actually good and ethical in a long run. And if you can't bear what is written then leave it for it is not meant for you. But I suggest you read 'Young's literal translation' and 'The Analytical Concordance to the Bible ' by Robert Young as they will help you understandd the actual sensical and logical truth of the Bible. About incest,it is important to distinguish between incestuous relationships prior to God commanding against them in Leviticus 18:6-18. There are numerous examples of incest in the Bible. The most commonly thought- of examples are the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve(Genesis 4), Abraham (whose real name was Avram) marrying his half sister Sarah(Genesis 20:12) etc. Lastly,I said this before and I'll say it again I'm not a Christian for I was not born one and God never wants me to be one. Also I'm not trying to wage any racial argument in the comment section and I won't be provoked to participate in one,I'm just telling you what is written in the Bible.( Pardon me for any grammatical mistakes for English is not my first language)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "P3GagfbA2vo", "cid": "Ugzz94frVFyUca3APn94AaABAg.97j1C0Q_oWe97qaNcyvvTK", "comment": "always I\u2019ve never been offered any actual evidence that anything supernatural is real.

The thing is there are two types of two types of human creations: one is referred to in Genesis 1: 26 and the other one in Genesis 2:7. The difference between the two is presence of spirit which the former one does not have but the latter one has. So not all human beings descend from Adam. Moreover,there is scientific evidence that some races are older than others and this concludes not all human beings have to have spirit to live and the other species definitely don't need any spirit in order to live. The difference between the spirit having and spiritless is pretty evident throughout history as the one with spirits have contributed much more to the greater good and advancement of the humanity in every field and the spiritless don't compare to them. The one with the spirit are the racial descendants of God who has a name which is Yahweh Elohim but the spiritless are mere creations and not directly related to God. Thus the Bible is the historical account of racial children of God,it has prophecies in it which were fulfilled and it is life guide book for the children of God and hence it is not exactly a magic book. Why I say not exactly is because the definition of magic is 'the power of apparently influencing events by using mysterious or supernatural forces' and God is supernatural but not mysterious,he makes himself and his appearance very clear if you read the original paleo-hebrew version or even the Greek translation of the Bible or 'Young's literal translation of Bible'.

What you see as absolute fact is only a possibility. You could look at a Whale and see an inefficient design, yet I see beauty as I watch a giant mother humpback whale push her newborn to the surface to take its first breath. You will not have liked that answer. Our God Created a diverse world and did this instantly. How could a bombardier beetle have developed its spray of toxins instantly? This is an extremely complex system which if only one part does not work perfectly the creature would die. How can a giraffe drink water? If any number of structures within the giraffe did not work the giraffe would not be able to drink. Where you see inefficiency, I see evidence of a design because the complex structures could not have arisen slow or else the creature would be dead. We have probably no idea what any number of so called \u201cvestigial\u201d organs or structures use is actually. They once thought the human tailbone was a vestigial tail, yet it is an essential connection point of the nerves and tendons. We have so few whale species that an examination of the function of its hip is extremely difficult. Also you can only say that 99.99 percent of all life is extinct if you in the believe in the assumption of millions of years. Because most of those creatures within that long timeframe are gone. Also, in human history we are the cause for many species going extinct, if there where once creatures like T-Rex walking with man we would have probably killed it for sport. Our God also did not design the world as we see it today, he did design it perfect even if his idea of perfection is not ours. Also what speciation is true macro-evolution? Bacteria to bacteria, and fish to fish is still micro-evolution or adaptation. And if evolution is the cause of life on earth; how did life begin? A pot of goo And a little lightning, yet even still scientists cannot create a bacteria out of raw matter. And if an intelligent scientist successfully makes a fully functioning reproducing bacteria. Can you still honestly call that random natural selection?   In the end it is a choice of faith. You choose to believe in evolution. And I choose to believe in my God, King Jesus. The only difference is that I already know I made the right decision, yet you will only learn that you made the wrong decision until it is too late.   \u201cThe fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds; there is none who does good.\u201d \u202d\u202dPsalm\u202c \u202d14:1\u202c \u202dESV\u202c  \u201cFor the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.\u201d \u202d\u202dRomans\u202c \u202d8:7\u202c \u202dESV\u202c\u202c  \u201c\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

I want to say thank you for being civil and having a pleasant debate (unlike other name callers in comments that add nothing to the conversation) regardless of where we stand.  2.) Theoretically,  Genetic mutations can cause 1 of 2 things:  A loss of information or a gain of new information.  3.) Virtually all observed mutations are in the category of loss of information. This is different from loss or gain of function. Some mutations can cause an organism to lose genetic information and yet gain some type of function. This is rare but has happened. These types of mutations have a beneficial outcome. For example, if a beetle loses the information to make a wing on a windy island Tama the mutation is beneficial because the beetle doesn't get blown out to sea and killed. Genetically, the mutation caused a loss of information but was helpful to the beetle. Thus, it was a beneficial outcome.  4.)  Besides mutations that cause information loss, in theory there could also be mutations that cause a gain of new information. There are only a few alleged cases of such mutations. However, if a mutated DNA strand were built up with a group of base pairs that didn't do anything, this strand wouldn't be useful. Therefor, to be useful to an organism, a mutation that has a gain of new information must also cause a gain of new function.  5.)  Your 1st example is point mutation.  We lost the information for one word as well as changed the meaning of the sentence. We did gain 1 word but we lost 1 word and lost the meaning of the original phrase so the overall result was a loss of information.  However many times point mutations won't produce another word. The chances for it to produce something unrecognizable far outweigh those that do. See progeria, a disease with resulting from this mutation.  6.)  Your 2nd example is known as deletion mutation. And Alicia mutation is a segment of DNA, whether a single base pair or an extensive length, that is deleted from the strand. This would be an obvious loss in this instance we only lost one letter. Some disorders from deletion mutations are facioscapulohemeral muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular dystrophy.   7.) There are also inversion, insertion, and frame shift mutations.  8.)  For molecules to man evolution to happen, there needs to be a gain in it NEE information within the organism's genetic material.   For instance, for a single celled organism, such as an amoeba, to evolve into something like a cow, new information ( Not random base pairs, but complex and ordered DNA)  Would need to develop over time that would code for ears lungs brain legs etc.  If an amoeba were to make a change like this, the dna would need to mutate new information. ( Currently, and amoeba has limited genetic information, such as the information for protoplasm).  This increase of new information would need to continue in order for a  Heart stomach kidneys etc to develop.  If ADN a strand gets larger due to a mutation, but the sequence doesn't code for anything (info for working lungs, veins, stomach acid, etc), Then the amount of DNA added is useless and would be more of a hindrance than a help.  9.)  I want deny that there have been a few arguable cases of information gaining mutation, but for evolution to be true, there would need to be billions and zillions of them. The fact is, we don't  Observe this in nature, but rather we see the opposit, organisms losing information. Organisms are changing, but the change is in the wrong direction how can losses of information add up to a gain?  10.) Thank you for reading all that.

The guessing game. And then the belief game.   You have no science behind your theory. I was just curious as to what you believed. Which is relevant. Don't know what you have to hide. We are talking about things that are from start to finish. You wanna say that you know how we came about...through evolution...so why just stop there? Why not continue the questions of causality? How did the animals come about? How did the cause of the cause of the animals come about? And so on and so forth. The question is, \"Where did everything come from?\" Not, \"Where did only certain things come from?\" Besides, your little math example of 1+1+1+1+1=5 still ceases to amaze me. How could one who has studied evolution come to that conclusion? That it's that simple.   I think that if evolutionists REALLY KNEW evolution then they would realize that it's not really possible.

What experiment and observation demonstrates this? And I mean repeatable experiments. None. It takes too long. Therefore you just have to believe in what someone told you.   \"And I will repeat myself, evolution is descent with inherited genetic variation via mutations and or genetic recombination, these variations in the dna can accumulate until you get new species.\"  Again, experiment please?

Which is no where near close to giving a proper analogy. I just used the example of the odds of a protein cell occurring because someone has done that already.

I will repeat myself again, evolution only explains biodiversity, where new species come from. Abiogenesis, is where life came from, by the definition of evolution I have shown you multiple times, if it doesn\u2019t have dna / rna and reproduce, then it can\u2019t evolve, therefore nothing beside inherited genetic variation via mutations and or genetic recombination is evolution. The Big Bang, not evolution, stellar and planetary formation, not evolution, stellarnucleosynthesis, not evolution, abiogenesis, not evolution. When I asked you if you knew what evolution is, why didn\u2019t you just say \u201cno, I have no idea.\u201d Because you obviously don\u2019t. The biological law of monophyly / biodiversity explains that no organism can evolve out of a preexisting Clade, a fish will always be a fish, just like how it is still a eukaryote, still a metazoan, still a eumetazoan, still a chordate, etc. You asked for repeated examples of observable evolution, I have given them to you, the problem is that you don\u2019t understand what evolution is.

We do observe natural selection and variation. I  have stated this before. And that is ALL we observe. But you want to take it many many steps further by saying that this process naturally and eventually leads to an ape becoming a man. I'm sorry. IT' IS NOT as simple as 1+1+1+1=5. No wonder why you believe in this hypothesis. Do you even know how many changes have to occur for this to happen? You can't just say, \"It could happen even though we haven't been around to observe it.\" You want to lump it all into one when it is clearly two separate things. You can't just observe variation or natural selection and cry out \"Evolution!\" Nope, it's just natural selection and variation. But the science community wants to put it in the evolution category. Let's get this straight, natural selection and variation have been observed, anything else has not.   \"Now, which answer makes more assumptions, do we have an observable process today by which populations of organisms can change to better survive in their enviroment, yes we do, evolution via natural selection.

If there was designer of this universe then it would appear to be supernatural to us because the designer would not be limited to the laws of this universe. In fact, the creator would be the one that created the laws of science without having to submit to them. This is the most logical answer judging by the DESIGN of the DNA cells.

Yes, you have observation of variation and natural selection but nothing else therefore you have to just believe it.

It appears you are uninformed about the predictions of Creationism and ID.

As far as falsifications go...sure there are falsifications (although the idea that falsifications are a requirement is not a universally accepted view of what makes a good theory).  To falsify ID, you just need to use unintelligent forces to create novel systems (not change existing complex systems).  If you could demonstrate unintelligent forces creating a strand of functional DNA, or a non-racemic useful protein, then you will have falsified Creation/ID.  And ID is a Theory, by the way, it provides explanations to the phenomena we experience and observe.  Sure, it raises questions and gives room for more research, but all theories have that same effect.  Do you think that Einstein's theory of relativity didn't provoke new questions and give room for new research?   Darwin admitted (in his 1859 \"Origins\" research) that intelligent design (animal husbandry) was very effective at producing new strains and varieties.  And he proposed his theory (Evolution) was a competitor to ID at that time.  So ID is observed, it was, is now, and always will be a valid explanation for these phenomena.

I can Prove The History Of Creation . Than You Can Prove one single thing is True about Evolution ! Tell me If Evolution is True it Goes by The Survival Of The Fittest ! How Come There Are no Dinosaurs Alive Today ? And Mankind is a Much Weaker Species ,Than a lot of other Species living today if , Everything Living Evolved From Fish That Crawled Out Of The Ocean How is It That Mankind is the Dominant Species above All other living Things if we all Evolved From Fish Shouldn\u2019t More Land Species including Mankind Have Gills ? And why is it That there isn\u2019t just one language if We all evolved From Fish Shouldn\u2019t There Be A Common Language where we Should Be Able To Talk To Animals And They Should Be Able To Talk To us ! If All Living Things evolved we should have more in common with all living life Right ? With Evolution We Are Suppose To Believe Everything Takes Billions Of Years to Evolve With not A single shrewd of Reasonable Proof Name one Species That has Evolved into Another Species Where Are Any Species In The Process Of Turning , Into Another Species , If Evolution were True there would be examples all over the Place ! But Evolution is a lie so Evolutionists Claims Everything Takes a Billion Years to evolve ! Why is it that Mankind is The Only Species That builds Cars And Aircraft And Ships ? I Will Tell You Why Because Everything That is Almighty GOD Created Everything That Is In 6 Thousand Years And Then He Rested ! Give me One Example Of Anything ,That Has Created Itself Man Created Cars And Aircraft And Ships They Didn\u2019t Create Themselves And Almighty GOD Created Man And The Bible Explains Everything ! But You Are Afraid Of The Truth !

And That Is Exactly What Satan , Wants You To Believe No Heaven , No Hell , HoRay ! I can live like I Please with no consequence ! I Pray In JESUS Name Almighty GOD Puts The Fear Of Him In You Before You Die ! Life Is A Test And A Short One And Those Who Fail Go To Hell Forever And You won\u2019t be Able to Evolve Your Way Out ! Even In Billions Of Years ! If I were You I Would Give it some Serious Thought Because once You Die There Are no Second Chances ! And Tomorrow is Promised to no one !
