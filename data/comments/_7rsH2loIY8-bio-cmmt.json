Perhaps the reason why so many modern societies oppress sexual minorities is because by doing so, they can make homosexuals reproduce, thereby increasing the species's chances of survival. One example (if I remember correctly) is that ancient Hebrew culture was very much against homosexuality, as well as masturbation and sodomy, but was very pro sex within marriage so people would end up having a lot of children. Having a lot of children was really important for the Hebrews, because the death rate was high, and they needed a lot of people to farm.

Oxygenated blood passes through these vessels---arteries--narrower arterioles and finally even narrower capillaries. However, even with many narrow capillaries, not every cell in the body can obtain the metabolic products it needs directly from the capillaries. Therefore, the final journey of these compounds is via a liquid solution which bathes the tissues-this is tissue fluid. Blood pressure increases as blood is squeezed into narrower and narrower vessels. Blood pressure in capillaries is so high that blood plasma is forced out under ultrafiltration from the capillaries-This plasma, along with dissolved molecules eg glucose, oxygen, amino acids etc. forms the tissue fluid. Cells absorb glucose and oxygen and release CO2 and waste products to the tissue fluid. This fluid must be returned to the circulatory system (eg back to the blood) to allow tissues to keep getting the substances they need. Most tissue fluid returns to the capillaries (as blood in capillary now has lower water potential than tissue fluid as blood plasma squeezed out+lots of undiluted proteins remain in blood-also loss of blood plasma has reduced blood pressure to lower than hydrostatic pressure of tissue fluid-so there is a pressure gradient too). However, not all tissue fluid can be returned via the capillaries. The rest returns via lymphatic system-Initially resembles capillaries but then merges into larger vessels and combines with vena cava just before entry to the heart to return to blood+remove waste products. Tissue fluid is moved along lymph by hydrostatic pressure gradient of tissue fluid (high at tissues, lower at vena cava end-so fluid moves down pressure gradient) and the contraction of muscles (the same as how blood moves through veins). Also, a system of valves ensure fluid only flows in 1 direction (again like veins). I hope this helps. It's basically just another network of vessels that return excess blood plasma to the blood after being squeezed out of capillaries :) Sorry for rambling! \u00a0\u00a0", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_7rsH2loIY8", "cid": "Ugjl5cpTXGC46ngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-GHe_92XgXjUaL0s", "comment": "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_7rsH2loIY8", "cid": "UggtCEZ8xJzUHngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-RK2O79SOs_JTH72", "comment": "Lindsey Leigh Awesome Lindsey, glad you enjoyed them.
