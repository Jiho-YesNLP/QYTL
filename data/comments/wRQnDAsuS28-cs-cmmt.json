Which college did you go to that they started with python? that Is my question, no doubt further down the line most of these colleges will have other classes that offer python as a second or third language. I don't think starting with python would be ideal in most colleges given that when they teach data structures and algorithms they use arrays as the foundation to teach you how they work in great depth, but arrays are practically non existing in python, everything is already predefined as list, tuples and dictionaries.   However, if you aren't interested in writing effective code, given the rise of powerful computers, than python is a great first language, but it is not what \"most\" universities start with.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
