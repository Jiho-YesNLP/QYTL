The exact number isn't known, and interestingly as Smithsonian points out, \"using different metrics gets you different outcomes\" (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-are-372-trillion-cells-in-your-body-4941473/). The article estimates 37.2 trillion. Which is...a lot of \"billions and billions!\" And you also have to wonder---are you going to count all the bacterial cells in our body? Because that's also a whole lot. Cell bio is fascinating ;)  P.S. Wanting to focus on prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cell characteristics only? Just to let you know, we have a new video focusing only on that! https://youtu.be/Pxujitlv8wc  UPDATE: We have videos dubbed in Spanish and Portuguese using an artificial voice via https://aloud.area120.google.com to increase accessibility.
