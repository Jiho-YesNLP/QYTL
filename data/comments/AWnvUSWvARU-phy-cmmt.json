Some people find music and sound in general distracting, but there's also the phenomenon of colateral inhibition (we \"drown out\" the sounds because the brain identifies more important stimuli: the stuff we see or feel we are writing) which can occur voluntarily to some extent.   Secondly, teaching helps information remain in our long-term memory because as social animals, any information we remember and then utilise in social interactions is automatically deemed relevant and thus is more easily kept in memory. To some extent, social interactions while studying also have similar effects to music: keeping you \"awake\" and preventing you from slacking off, those being good reasons some people work together (just don't do it with your crush because all your brain will focus on is romance, unless you exercise great control).  For people who have made it this far, I'd like to finish with some encouragement: there are many reasons to study, it obviously makes you a better person, but not just mentally, also physically. This stuff is still ongoing research, but it is widely considered that training your brain actually makes it better (kinda like muscle, although not as evidently) in functional organisation, increasing speed of reaction and formulating ideas, even in structure (more dendrites, postmembrane receptors and neurotransmitter vesicles). \ud83e\udde0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AWnvUSWvARU", "cid": "UgwezzcmUWYiIKEhqjN4AaABAg", "comment": "Create strength of materials course videos", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AWnvUSWvARU", "cid": "UgwpbehG2jli2jcoLmJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Discrete Mathematics and Abstract Algebra videos would be very helpful!! :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AWnvUSWvARU", "cid": "UgyeUxjiNBvJDKlWKSN4AaABAg", "comment": "One thing that helped me pass my exams is watching ur vids the night before or just 2 hours before exam i usually don't study tho but ur vids helped me alot .

All your favorite study techniques follow these concepts Active recall is like challenging your brain to think really hard about a lesson. The act of thinking really hard helps you remember even better in the long-term. - a good example of active recall are practice tests and questions. These questions challenge your bare knowledge (no textbook, no notes) to answer a questions about a topic. Active recall makes you think really hard. There are more study techniques that follow active recall.  Spaced Repetition takes advantage of how our brain works. Once we first learn a concept, we forget after an hour. If we review this concept an hour later, we will forget after another day. If we review after a day, we will forget after three days and so on. Search up the \"Forgetting Curve\" for specifics. This forgetting curve is basically your time schedule for studying information to cement it in your brain.  - Flashcards take advantage of this pretty well. Some apps like Anki and RemNote already make the flashcards spaced out for you.   Hope this Helps!

Time management: throughout the day, write down any due dates or tasks you get and once a day, transfer these items to a master calendar that you then use to plan your days  2. If the teacher publishes their slides, use those to take notes on (print ahead of time or use a tablet)  3. Use any study guide or practice test provided. If nothing's provided ask if they can make one or if they can suggest certain problems from homework/the book that would help you study.  4. Find good study spots early in the semester. Coffee shops, study rooms that you can reserve, random computer labs that nobody uses... It's worth finding these now so you don't waste time trying to find a free table at a crowded library later  5. For notes: I write the main concept as well as steps for solving a problem, then a couple example problems. I like to highlight the main concepts and steps in different colors. This really helps my memory and to keep things organized in my head. It also makes it easy to look through old notes and make a quick practice test with those example problems or flash cards with those main concepts  6. Network with the other students. Find out if there's a discord anyone uses. Get there early for class and stay late. Talk to the other students during these times, especially the first few classes. The information and connections you get during these times can be incredibly useful  7. Take advantage of office hours  8. study the course material before the lecture so that you can use that time to ask questions and not just take notes and try to figure out what they're talking about  Good luck everyone!

Basically they're little piece of notes where you write questions on one side and answer on the other side. You can easily find them at bookstores or if not, just cut a big paper into several small square pieces, each about 5cm long.   What you want to do next is write the equations on one side of the flashcards, then flip them over and write the name of the equation on the other side.   For example, i wanna memorize the Equation of State. On one side, i write \"what is the equation of state?\", then i flip the card, and write the equations on the other side.   Once you're done writing the flashcards, put them together like a little deck, make sure the questions side are facing up, maybe shuffle them and begin to answer the questions written on them. Once you're done with one, flip the card and check whether you got it right or not.   If you get it right, place the card down on the table, which side face up doesn't matter.   If you didn't get it right, memorize it again then put it at the back of the stack of cards, question side facing you. Repeat till you finish every card.   You can even just start out with only 5 cards and eventually expand it till you get all the equations.   This really helps me as i have memory issues and I absolutely suck at remembering things. I hope it helps you too  Edit: oh and make sure you review the cards often. Like, i do it 3 times a day toward exams.

Study outside of your room 2. Set a timer for like 15-30 minutes to study then take a break 3. On your breaks walk, get water, play a simple game 4. Make a to-do list  5. While studying listen to white noise or instrumental. I mean you can listen to lyrics but I don't because it can be distracting. I prefer silence, it feels weird at first, but it also helps you really focus 6. Study with people to keep you accountable or don't lol if you get easily distracted 7. If you're tired take a nap for 5-10 minutes or stop for the day, you're not being productive, just accept it and sleep 8.  Youtube videos are good but don't be afraid to ask a friend, classmate, tutor or teacher/professor for help 9.  Turn off all your notifications 10. Use a timer on your laptop/desktop instead 11. Don't study while hungry, I would say you can take a break to eat but then you could get distracted 12. Don't be afraid to say no to people, sometimes you have to study instead of hanging out and good friends will understand that. I call it \u2728hermit mode\u2728 13. Practice a lot, if it's not fun do you really understand it? jk kinda, for me when I finally understand like a math or science concept it's kinda fun, so  keep that in mind 14. Don't overstuff your brain. 15.  Write down concepts you don't fully get/understand 16. SLEEP, BROOOOOOOOOO if you don't sleep well all your efforts are in vain 17. Make a schedule of your entire day if you procrastinate easily, that way you have time to study and stuff and don't have to cram 18. If you didn't do good in a class specifically like math or science, where everything you learn is built on each other study over break, I know it's not fun but it's better than trying to catch up later. Like I did trash in chemistry but I have to take chem 2 next semester sooooo I'm studying now \ud83d\ude12 19. Write a recap of everything, and if you forget to write something go back and study it again 20. Repetition is key, doing lots of practice problems, rewriting the same things, or hearing the same things over and over they all help That's all I have, I think, uh have fun studying, it doesn't have to be hard. sometimes we make things more complex than they need to be.  no, I'm back 21. If you can, take notes before class. like, watching the lecture or class from last year or even the other class(like if you have TTR classes, you can watch MWF classes)  if available because for the most part, it's the same thing. And then you can just add on what the teacher says in class.   For me taking notes in class is bad because I'm focused more on just getting down whatever the teacher is saying or writing(obvi not all of it, just the main stuff) but it's still hard for me. Like I'll be trying to think about the atomic structure e of an atom isn't really accurate usually and next thing ya know she's talking about how to find the percent of an element with just the mass of the entire compound but the compound name is just Xy(II)Xz.. jk kinda. my point is I get behind and my notes get sloppy, and I end up being confused. But when I watch the recorded version I can pause and take my time, you could also watch the video after class, but then you'll be a bit behind               ayo this is pretty solid advice I should listen to myself more", "votes": "9", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AWnvUSWvARU", "cid": "Ugwy2hTYSeeGZRUSrid4AaABAg", "comment": "When it comes to homework, study the questions themselves.

Having two notebooks, one for rough scribbles and one for smart writing is really useful. I use the rough book in class and use a smart notebook for revision. Your smart notebook should be written in a way that YOU understand! I highly recommend the Leuchtturm1917 notebooks they're such a pleasure to write on, once you tried one you'll never want to go back.  2. Colour code your revision notes in the smart notebook. I use a Bic pen (multi-pen) which comes with 4 colours. It makes it a lot quicker than having lots of different pens. The key that worked for me is: - Black: General writing  - Blue: Laws - Green: Important Actions - Red: Don't forget! Sure, it might seem slow at first but when i took the time to make neat notes i was surprised how much I used them as a resource that I still refer back to from previous semesters.  3. Use different media sources, invest in a good textbook and work through that, if you're an engineering student I highly recommend getting Engineering Mathematics by KA Stroud. Also,  watch videos with each section, seeing different approaches not only makes problems easier but gives you a greater appreciation for the wider subject.  4. Study with or teach others - Working through problems together or helping someone else helps solidify eveything you  know already and helps explore alternatives.   5. Get a subscription to a maths solver like Symbolab (just don't use it in the exam haha) being able to break down a problem and see exactly where you're going wrong.  6. Use a second brain technique, have a document on your phone to put down all your ideas, so you don't forget them, have a eureka moment while shopping? Put it in your second brain!  7. When you watch videos, set playback speed to 0.75 speed and turn subtitles on.   Always ask questions and seek help when you need it. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, make them an experience you can learn from. Never lose your enthusiasm to learn more, it may seem bitter medicine at first but eventually you start enjoying the subject and get a positive feedback loop going. You got this!

I remember using your sat preparation video.   when I took the exam, I passed with the exact score needed. like @Hedy I tend to get lost in my imagination because I'm a writer, always trying to come up with new plotlines, and figure out how to drive the story forward. so, most of my tips to stay on task and do well in my classes are similar.  1. remove distractions. if you live with your family, you can ask your parent, or sibling to keep your phone until you finish studying 2. if the subject is difficult, such chem, bio, maths, etc study for 2 hrs with 10 min break after each hour 3. spend your time studying for all of your classes. you don't want to ignore a class or more than one. it will affect your GPA, and even your confidence, well that depends if you think you're good in that subject but because you didn't study, you ended up not reaching your potential.  4. get enough exercise! I'm not very good at time management but have improved. regardless, I tend to walk/dance sometimes more than work out. it boosts my mood immediately 5. get enough sleep and stay hydrated. this is very important even if you're not a student 6. study a week before the exam or 2 weeks before. but make sure you're not studying just one subject that day, vary the subjects you study. instead of an hour, study at least each day 10 minutes if it's two weeks before. if it's a week before, then find a good time in the day for 2 hours  7. make flashcards, outlines, mind maps, or anything that helps you recall and memorize quickly 8. write notes, review them after class, and shorten them if possible 9. use professor's study guides to prep for exams and other good resources like organicchemtutor 10. lastly, believe in yourself  these are some of the tips I used as an education major with a specialization in bio, and got all A's in my fall semester. except for chem thanks to me not giving time for chem ahah RIP  I'm taking honors chem 2, a & p #1, tx gov, and humanities next semester (:", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AWnvUSWvARU", "cid": "UgwuJ5FPmKIGEilK6jt4AaABAg", "comment": "Pls sir I want to you to make videos on Laplace Transform, differential equations.

Solve problems in some scratch paper and transfer solved problems to another physical notebook (notebook 2). Work your way up from the easiest to the hardest/more obscure problems so as to be prepared for however difficult problems may come up in the test.\r 4. Put important formulas to be memorised and some useful tips in an index card.

You can go back to your index card whenever you forget a formula or want to memorise a dozen of things instead of going through numerous pages of the notebook.\r 5.

The reason why is because I have found that, in college, you need to know more than just general concepts.  You need to know the details and UNDERSTAND those details in terms of the broader concepts and connections between those broader concepts.  Finally, if you can find a way to enjoy the class itself (maybe you don\u2019t like the professor, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about), you are most likely going to find that it is exceptionally easier to be able to teach the class to someone else (like I talked about above).

Ask your professor/teacher for the course syllabus at the beginning of the semester or look at it online if you can.

If you have time to study in your free time, study from 10:00 am-2:00 pm. Study shows that this is one of the greatest time of the day to study. 4. Avoid procrastination at all costs.

Our teacher is quite lazy and too simple in teaching. So here I am, most of our lessons are about algebra 2 and some statistics (Measures of Position and Grouped and Ungrouped Data, Which I already know because of you and thank you).   In your Question at 1:20 = the Answer to that question for me is to simply be active in that class. Most get distracted or bored and that's not good. You should be active all the time, Although you are not participating by raising your hand. You will learn as you understand the lesson itself. And also get keywords, to memorize the main concept of a lesson faster. Then find little details that might come up as a question in an exam. And that's why most of my test/quiz scores are either a pass or perfect even. Some of my classmates were very confused about how I was doing it despite my not participating in the discussion before. And that's the question they need to answer for themselves. And now here I am, Even though it's Christmas Break. Still studying math because it's my favorite of all. It's quite fascinating that I can solve these wtf questions with ease and simplicity. Most of my classmates can't, most are very dependent on the teacher's teaching and depend on what technique they use. And that's a problem, because what if one particular problem needs to be solved differently compared to the example the teacher gave? for example and my infamous one of all: 1.) Factor x^4 + 6x^2 - 27 = 0 and solve for x. Now our teacher said to JUST use synthetic division all throughout, and that's exhausting, right? you also need to find the right number whose remainder is 0 to use synthetic division again and again until it's not possible anymore. So LITERALLY my whole class is trying that exactly and that's why they take so much time to solve. So how about me? Substitution like you teach me: Now the problem x^4 + 6x^2 - 27 = 0 Let's say A = x^2, then A^2 = x^4. So the problem will look like this: A^2 + 6A - 27 = 0 /// Now it's a normal trinomial equation, so let's solve. Find 2 numbers that multiply to -27 but add to 6. The answer is 9 and negative 3 since 9 x -3 = -27 and also 9 + (-3) = 6. So: (A + 9)(A - 3) = 0 /// Now let's replace A with x^2 again. = (x^2 + 9)(x^2 - 3) = 0 /// So that's it! [Maybe (x^2 + 9) can be factored to (x + 3i)(x - 3i)] so x = 3i (since it will be the square root of -9) and the other x equals the square root of 3 since 3 is not a perfect square. And that's it, literally... Better than spamming the synthetic division... And since I advance and quickly learn all of the lessons in our grade level (which is 10). I am now free to do the lessons I need for STEM on the math side because I love math. And Sir, I have a question. What lessons do I need to learn for grades 11 - 12 (or just senior and junior high I think?) and college math? Do you have videos for them? if there are, then thank you again!  and also for your question in 4:15 = That is STEM for sure... and oh your suggestion on what you should teach us next in a video? For me honestly, The AP, BC, or BA Calculus? I am quite curious about those... Or maybe they are too advanced for you? (Maybe underestimated you at this point, sorry). And those olympiad math questions! and other math-related puzzles I think...  And a personal note, I very thank you sir for giving me something to kill time for. And eventually, something I love, you're videos are very simple yet informative and give every last bit of information we needed. And can be later used in more advanced problems in the future, I cannot thank you enough for what gives you've given me. In my elementary days, I hate math because I always question what the hell is this?! I always thought math to be just a subject for critical thinking and problem solving but now. It has a lot more meaning to it, Because I enjoyed math which started 4 years ago I eventually know why is it important.

One is for memorizing things, one is for general studying, and the last is for math. 1) When you need to memorize things like functional groups, chemical reactions, taxonomies, or really anything like that, write it out several times as you say it. I once heard that seven times is enough but I usually shoot for 20 to be safe. I then test myself until I get all of them right. If I don't, I right them again. It's time consuming but it works because it uses writing, reading, speech, and hearing all at the same time. 2) Read through chapters once just to go through the material. Then go through it again and make your own notes on it in your own words. If something is still a little confusing, get help or watch a few videos. 3) Do all the examples in your book, then do them again. If you can go through the examples with no problem then move on to problems at the end of the chapter. Bonus) This is really useful in math but can help in any subject. Once you know how to do a problem, learn to do it quick. Time yourself or race your friends in the class to finish problems quickly. The point is to be able to do problems to point that they are intuitive and you don't have to think too hard on them. I know I usually overthink math problems and end up getting them wrong. Less chance to doubt your answer=less chance to mess it up.
