The only time you have an electric field is when you have a hertzian waveform. An example of a longitudinal electromagnetic waveform is one that is generated between the torus and the Earth in a Tesla coil. Again there is no magnetic field generated from the longitudinal wave. The reason for this is the longitudinal wave vibrates in the same direction as it travels, where is a Hertzian wave vibrates at a 90 degree angle from the direction of the wave.", "votes": "3", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "mOEFTX9DAEw", "cid": "UgztET8wmvON6HS93xx4AaABAg", "comment": "The electric field of Coulomb's law diverges at the origin.
