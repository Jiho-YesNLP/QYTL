Is there such a way, or are those the only ways we know of to know which formula to use and if the answer is a tangent, cosine or a sine?

Now split the line AC in half, and call the midpoint D.  We now have a right triangle, A, B, D.   The angles of all sides of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees, and since the angle at point A remained unchanged, its angle is 60 degrees.

We know side length AB, which is the original side length of the equilateral triangle, which of course is 1.  We also know side length AD, because it is exactly half of AC, which was 1.  Therefore we know side length AD to equal 1/2.  Set up lengths AB, AD, and BD in the Pythagorean theorem. AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2  Solve for BD: BD = sqrt(AB^2 - AD^2)  Plug in AB = 2 and AD = 1 BD = sqrt(1^2 - (1/2)^2) BD = sqrt((2/2)^2 - (1/2)^2) BD = sqrt(4/4 - 1/4) BD = sqrt(3/4) BD = sqrt(3)/2  We now show that triangle A, B, D has leg 1 equal to 1/2, leg 2 equal to sqrt(3)/2, and a hypotenuse of 1.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "cqIZue-plBI", "cid": "Ugz7tmMb7S7fRAoUH814AaABAg.9FvG4gigv2O9FvqWTWzV3W", "comment": "Because the triangle itself is located in those quadrants.
