Then linear maps, bilinear forms, inner products, etc. One can mention that matrices are a way to represent the objects studied during the course in a certain basis, but that's all. They should not be the main object of study. The detail of the manipulation of these matrices, the Gauss-Jordan elimination method, the computation of the determinant, etc., should be taught in a separate numerical analysis course.

(We should note the order of the operands of the multiplication giving the overall-elimination-matrix: the second-step-elimination-matrix goes to the left and the first-step-elimination-matrix goes to the right.)   In this case, E is E12 times E21.  If we perform the multiplication of E12 and E21, we obtain E:      [ 7  -3]     [-2   1]  If we perform the multiplication of E and A (or the multiplication of A and E, though we should remember that, generally speaking, matrix multiplication does not obbey the commutativity law), we obtain I (the identity matrix).
