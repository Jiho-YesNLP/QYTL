The dipole moment is a measure of charge separation.  A neutral molecule or object that has a perfect even distribution of positive and negative charge has a dipole moment of zero.  A molecule that has charge separation, (one side positive and the other side negative) has a net dipole moment.  The greater the dipole, the greater the magnitude of charge separation also known as polarization.  Polar molecules like water tend to have a permanent dipole - the oxygen part of water has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atoms bear a partial positive.  That's my way of describing dipole moments - a measure of charge separation / polarization.
