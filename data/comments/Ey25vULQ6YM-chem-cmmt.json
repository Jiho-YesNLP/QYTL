We might be having wrong concept of time. Time may also be a Quantized entity and not continuous! The electrons will fall into nucleus if we update our concept of time. Quantized nature of time can be proved. To prove this, watch a movie that was released some 50 years ago from now. suppose it was of duration 3 hours at the moment of its release. If we watch this movie TODAY, it will take us more than 3 hours of TODAY! It means that we are not able to watch a movie of 3 hours (which was released 50 years ago) in 3 hours of today. This clarifies that TIME is PASSING RAPIDLY.  The rapid passage of time can explain that electrons can fall into the nucleus provided time start passing rapidly so much so that this phenomenon of electrons falling into the nucleus could be OBSERVED. Supposed a quantum of time is of X years, then, it remains of X years only as the time passes but every phenomenon might be having its own specific and well-defined time passage rate for it to occur...The phenomena of electrons falling into the nucleus would occur when time passes so rapidly that it becomes equal to its defined time passage rate...", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Ey25vULQ6YM", "cid": "UgwzxSo-gNXd-ng8rMZ4AaABAg", "comment": "They have to look into CBSE book.....", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Ey25vULQ6YM", "cid": "UgzipMO7mQpwH65WbIR4AaABAg", "comment": "In case it helps others watching, please listen carefully to the instructor's words at 44:18 (transcript below).\r \r \"Any frequency can't have an energy ...

This CLEARLY explains the term c4 from Einstein's field equations (regarding his general theory of gravitation). Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are\u00a0linked\u00a0AND\u00a0BALANCED\u00a0opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON\u00a0BALANCE\u00a0that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN\u00a0BALANCE. The MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE AND the FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE are thus NECESSARILY\u00a0LINKED\u00a0and\u00a0BALANCED, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. TIME is necessarily possible/potential AND actual IN\u00a0BALANCE, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (Very importantly, outer \"space\" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.)\u00a0BALANCE\u00a0and completeness go hand in hand. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Great !!! INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. \"Mass\"/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. CLEARLY, I have mathematically, sensibly, and THEORETICALLY unified physics/physical experience; as E=mc2 is CLEARLY proven to constitute what is F=ma ON\u00a0BALANCE. Gravity/acceleration involves\u00a0BALANCED\u00a0inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or\u00a0BALANCED\u00a0with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT !!! Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Very carefully consider what is THE MAN who IS standing on what is the EARTH/ground. E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!!
