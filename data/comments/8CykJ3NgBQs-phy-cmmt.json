Momentum serves as the initial cause of pushing and pulling.  The energy, emanating from the internal core of a planet, is what gives rise to momentum, commonly referred to as gravity, and not due to the planet\u2019s size, mass, or space-time curvature.  For example, when energy is applied, it generates the necessary momentum for the actions of pushing and pulling.  Without the application of energy, momentum cannot be established.  Consequently, force cannot be exerted for pushing and pulling, as it lacks a physical existence.  This, in turn, clarifies why force is not gravity. ~Guadalupe Guerra", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8CykJ3NgBQs", "cid": "UgwSTgg9B5d6qG6xaVJ4AaABAg", "comment": "\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8CykJ3NgBQs", "cid": "Ugx2DtzLi9bAOoQ7EEp4AaABAg", "comment": "Okay so from i am from India this is taught to us in class 9 is this the same way in every country or is it different ?", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8CykJ3NgBQs", "cid": "UgxxPBLwUQ8V3z1rV2J4AaABAg", "comment": "I have a new theory on gravity that explains why galaxies look like vortexes, and where the heat of precipitation comes from.
