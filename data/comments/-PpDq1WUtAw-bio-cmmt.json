We can only hope that Prof. Sapolsy still has enough drive and energy to revive his old flame.  Our Incredibly Learned Professor is now 65 and retired. Not a chance that we'll ever get a new fresh series of lectures. The available ones are those already filmed and recorded. However, I still have a special request to our Incredibly Learned Professor.\u00a0 His most effective impact on the masses of common people now living on our planet is not just through the diffusion of this magnificent series of lectures of scientific research. It is even more so through his famous  ZEBRAS book, the one that made his reputation as a world expert on stress. And it is indeed an immensely valuable book for us, common Joes, since it. offers a clear and simple treatment of the roughly 20 major basic problems of daily existence and survival confronting PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IN OUR MODERN WORLD. For instance, beyond ulcers and fleeing hungry lions on the savannah, digestion, eating, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, strokes, anxiety, sex, pain, depression, memory, sleep, type A personalities, aging, addiction, etc..This book can in effect serve as a guide on how to understand the mechanisms of those complex challenges of survival in our technological world, and also how to cope with them. So my request to our Incredibly Learned Professor is simple. Not a few more scientific lectures or cultural videos, but a new edition of his famous book,  WHY ZEBRAS DON'T GET ULCERS. That would be the 4th edition, reprising the 3d edition of 2004. This would give our Incredibly Learned Professor the occasion to review and revise his text of nearly 20 years ago and, as an  unexpected bonus, expand it, if he should find in his waning years the time, the heart, and the energy for this 4th edition. The difficulty is that by now Professor Sapolsky has become more interested in the grander, larger picture of total human behavior, as in his recent book of BEHAVE (2017). He has announced somewhere that he is already involved in preparing another book, which may be another colossal treatment of the existing literature. Whether he will feel inclined at the age of 65 to revisit and improve on his famous book of younger maturity is sadly very doubtful. And if this were so, it would be a huge loss for the millions afflicted by the daily problems analyzed in the ZEBRAS book.

Very very cool. I have some of the answers to why what you are doing doesn't work because I could have been one of you if I had been not quite so nuroatypical and my father hadn't been so nuroatypical. Instead I was adopted out and became one of those you guys made the wrong decisions about. I became one of them. So I can see both sides I enjoy these kinds of lectures emensly, I self taught myself how to do suturing on myself and some chickens and hamsters that would have died otherwise. But I am in my current state  pathologically incapable of sight-reading music or doing higher math and about one third of my Paternal genetic line has some version of this nuroatypical difference and maladaption. About one in ten of us ends up having huge amounts of time in mental health institutions and it has been this way since since at least the revolutionary war. So this is what I have learned so far.  Capitalism does not work as is. It's just a very complicated pyramid scheme. Very soon it wont even work out for you guys at the very top either. Socialism does not work either because the help it could give everyone gets funneled and mismanaged into the infrastructure that is supposed to decide who gets what and that infrastructure of middle men becomes an all consuming cancer that plagues us all. Adoption as it stands is a very very bad idea and if you wish to know all the details of that ask. We don't have a very good system of managing what individuals can be trained to do for the good of the whole. People at the bottom that are nuroatypical but have good insights are seen as a threat to the whole because we are few and far between and we see outside the box. We are not your enemies and you need us and the ones at the bottom need us too. Control is an illusion. You can have power yes. But eventually you will be king of a dead hill and the time is almost here now where there will be no one left asking you if you want fries with that. The correctional  system  is a failure and remedies like probation and parole do not work as is. There are a few preimtive programs that do actually work but they are vastly underfunded because it seems like in order for an agency to get more funding it has to \"address more need\" to justify itself so it doesn't actually fix issues it puts bandaids on problems that need sutures so that issues that originally would have taken dollars to fix take thousands and millions. You can actually have your cake and eat it too. You don't have to push up inflation when the government does actually give some of us stimulus to keep us all under your thumb and anxious as Hades. You don't have to create systems where you create a certain percentage of  unemployment and useless unimportant jobs everyone fights for and spends one third of their lives doing. The planet doesn't have the reasources for that and you know that. But you don't have to be afraid of the masses or control them. What you must do if you are to survive and we are to survive is you must set up everything so that no one wins till everyone does. Till everyone being their best self that is best for themselves and everyone else around them is rewarded. You must set things in motion to where it is in everyone's best interest to learn self control so  we are all doing what we should be including you guys. Watch how chickens and bees manage themselves. Chickens if there is the right numbers of males and females and the right amount of space manage themselves with only food and shelter provided by us and they don't even need that in their wild state where they only lay 8 to 12 eggs a year. Look at the honey bee. The queen makes all the young but the workers collectively make all of the descions. everything in an average hive works better for them than us when we are at our most functional. Why not instead of immaculating public education to the point where those generations after gen x don't know the difference between a country and a continant we teach folks how to think inductively and deductively and we teach self control and reward empathy and conscientious behavior so those that do not have these traits are at least strongly encouraged to emulate them. After we do that we take some time and ask every male if they want to be an empathetic and conscientious father if they do not they should either be required to obstain from procreative sex or have a vasectomy. After that is done so we can actually restart a fair baseline for society to function we work on how to think and collaborate together as a group. Instead of having a bunch of government programs that do not work for anyone and waste huge resources. Let every citizen decide where each dollar of their taxes gets allocated. Corporations should pay for infrastructure for Roads and sewage and help to maintain powerlinnes and health care because corporations benefit from the infrastructure in place and healthy workers who are therefore more productive. We should have anonymous electronic suggestion terminals that a very highly developed set of computer of computer programs not ai manage and sort so that good and effective ideas get found through computer simulation and implemented for the good of the whole with an anonymous rewards system granted to  imagineers with the ideas that benefit mankind the most and a pin used to input the ideas and receive rewards once the idea is fully assessed and tested. We could cut the lottery jackpots and prizes by 80 percent and use the amounts for people's ideas ranked by communal good it does.

Any person with an open mind should be capable of seeing that the re-branding of Multiple Personality Disorder to Dissociative Identity Disorder is just constantly trying to avoid the term 'consciousness'. Even though it is understandable that within the pathological version most of these personalities or identities seem more like fragments of a consciousness, or simply 70% or just 10% of a 'full consciousness', there's a lot of moral and ethics that nobody wants to address in this issue. If a fragment has no memory of any other fragments existing, is it okay to still label it as merely a fragment and work against its existence? Does it have free will?  It gets even more complicated within the realm of positive plurality. When you identify yourself as several, at which point are there so many that each one's life quality suffers from it so much that nobody gets a good deal out of it? 10? 100? And if it's 100 different souls, is it okay to supress, merge, inactivate or kill them to increase the life quality for a smaller portion of these forms of consciousness?  In our opinion science is here still heavily under the influence of the demonic possession hypothesis, just not about demons, but about the \"one body, one soul\" rule established mostly by the big monotheistic religions. If a gene sequence exists that forms the singular consciousness within the mind, it can just as easily be duplicated or read in a way that it simply won't stop producing consciousness.

I am certain his epilepsy was untreated. THe only direct bullying of a child I ever saw growing up was when walking as a group to our respective homes after school other boys would sometimes  taunt him verbally.I asked WHY after he dropped out of the group to go inside his house and was told those things about him. I was about 8yrs old..it was the first memory I have of feeling highly empathic for another child and speaking up to try to stop the bullying. I really told off the boy who had taunted him and he slunk away from the rest of us. No one never bullied him again in my earshot.I was shocked that I had done that...the most grievous taunter was a boy older than I. OVer that summer I was  away for the summer. WHen school started I noticed his brother was with the group but no sign of the epileptic boy...I still remember his name Wayne Smalley. I was told he had been swimming  in the river that summer, had a seizure and and had drowned. It was the first time I had a complete picture of a truly horrific and tragic life. I think of him still from time to time with sorrow. The social stigma of epilepsy WAS still around in the 1950s....I think bec it frightened people , the unco trollablitiy of the body and it is scary to behold. Scarier still to have I am sure.   I recently owned a dog who fell off a terrace a few times which gave him closed head trauma, brain bleeds and swelling I am sure because he developed epilepsy.

I'm not a biology student, never was. Flunked out of uni (quite happily) about a decade ago...just an unemployed (or self-employed with a generous interpretation) writer. Any number of lines in the first few lectures must've drawn in fellow English literature students, like 'How many of you believe in free will?' and while an interesting discussion, it's not what really hooked me to finish this course to its end. It's not what assured me that, by the end of this course, I will have felt this lecture was worth it. It was when he began to attack the first bucket and the specific phrase of not wanting to believe in the 'just so' stories that hooked me.  \u00a0See, the vast majority of writers on this planet are content with nothing but their 'just so' stories. It's what makes their job so much easier than if they had to write something resembling the truth, especially if they're writing fiction (although, to be fair, this tendency for 'just so' stories has never stopped non-fiction journalists from inventing their own distorted mental image of their subjects and misrepresenting them either). To hear a genuine admission, that scientists have many, many times in the past fallen into this exact same trap, simply because they wanted to amplify the importance of their chosen specialized field at the expense of others, was what gave me hope that by the end of this lecture I wouldn't get yet another 'just so' story, a version of which I've almost certainly already read or thought of myself.  \u00a0Finishing this lecture (as well as the additional two older versions of Depression + Religiosity), I think that what I saw and heard was extremely rare: A storyteller (or lecturer, if you prefer) who gives you something far better than 'just so' stories and their answers; The mental tools to ask better questions about the human condition.

We are made up of matter.  And of course also, if my latest Theory Of Everything idea is correct, that what is called gravity is a part of the currently recognized 'em' photon, gravity being a force that acts 90 degrees to the em forces which of course act 90 degrees to each other, and that the 'gem' photon is the energy unit of this universe that makes up everything in this universe, then we are all beings of 'light' in a universe made up of 'light' and interacting 'light'.  We are basically all the same and basically no different than anything else in existence.  Edit: Consider also:  Science claims that everything in existence came into existence from an expanding singularity, including the very forces of nature this universe functions by.  But now, does everything in existence even exist per se, OR does ONLY the singularity exist in the form of all things?  Revised TOE: 3/25/2017a.\r My Current TOE:\r \r THE SETUP:\r 1. Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.\r  ____________________________________________________________________________________________  Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.\r \r a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.\r b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.\r c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.\r (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)\r d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.\r e. Do this with the em fields on and off.\r (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.)\r f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.\r (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)\r \r (An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)\r \r 'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done.\r 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.

But I get too specific, leaving many other complex processes out.  I mention only because many commentors apparently believe that nonscientific ideations they carry or have been exposed to, have weight or validity in modern science or common sense. Emergent properties due to interaction of even three simple rule systems creates unpredictable complexity, as those understanding math know. My wish for another,  chromatin-variation bucket is added here merely to emphasize that individuality is never diminished, but always increases through this modality.

Quite obviously the problem of people diagnosing demonic possession was not a problem of failing to distinguish between people and their disease as the professor suggests out of the blue. The problem was assuming their religion explained the phenomenon which had other causes. Further, the only real problem with that was that they thought they believed in punishing people beyond the practical need to separate certain people who are not willing or capable of participating in society- a topic which would have been a far more interesting conversation.  This would have been a good opportunity to talk about the practical irrelevancy of free will. Even if we have souls, none of us chose our soul, mind or any of the environment that is 'us' and none of us can claim full responsibility for anything.

Mix that with human competitive nature, people who are different are forced to learn a incorrect self perception, to give advantage to the more socially adaptive cognitive functions. And that a simple practice of say playing a simple game like reading a traditional clock, can and does, thanks to understanding of neuroplaticity in Barbara's book, does change cognitive differences.

Thank you, Dr. Sapolsky, this is what I've been saying for so long: it's too easy to just separate the brain abnormalities we can categorize (schizophrenia, OCD, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) from us \"normal people,\" when in reality there's no more or less reason to consider the biological underpinnings of the behavior of someone who's \"just a jerk\" than to do the same for someone with something we can diagnose.  The priority should be on achieving the best balance between protecting people from the harmful behaviors of others, and humanely treating those who exhibit those behaviors.  For some people, this may involve removing a brain tumor, and for others it may require incarceration and rehabilitation, but there's no clear line between the two.

I was a Christian and avoided looking at the evidence carefully for a long time. And when I finally did look at it with a critical eye, despite being biased heavily in favor of Christianity, I eventually came away not believing in it. I really wanted it to be true and I was very sad that I didn't find justification.  I think the resurrection in particular is a really bad place to start though. Any miracle really, I find it really hard to get around Hume's argument about miracles. Or more particularly, how do you weigh evidence for a natural law being violated. What do you weigh it against? If you look at it in a Bayesian sense, what is your starting probably for a natural law being violated?  If someone looks at my lottery ticket and says it looks like I won the powerball, if I estimate their chance of being wrong as 1 in 1000 and my chance of winning as being 1 in 292,000,000. The chance is overwhelmingly likely that they are just wrong. If I double check and my chances are also 1 in 1000, the chance is still overwhelmingly likely that I'm wrong. If I continue to check and recheck and take the ticket to the office and they check with a computer. Once I rule out dreaming or psychosis etc. eventually I can reasonably conclude that I did indeed win as I will have overcome that starting probability.   But what is the starting probability for a violation of natural law, if you are unbiased? How could you ever have enough evidence to overcome an undefined likelihood? And if you are open to violations of natural law, why only accept one supernatural explanation? Why not let every undefined explanation in? The trickster god is fooling you? You're in a simulation? We all live our own separate realities? Aliens did it? etc. It seems you would need to accept all of these as possibilities if all natural explanations were ruled out and any unknown natural explanations. Of course it's a different story if you are already convinced God exists and regularly performs miracles, then there is some starting probability for you that could be overcome.  If you looked at a magician performing a really solid trick, how long would you scratch your head saying you don't know what the natural explanation is, until you shrug your shoulders and accept that he really just sawed that guy's head off, carried it around the stage and then reattached to the guy's body? I suspect you would likely just say you don't know what happened.   That's the boat I would be in if ever a miracle had some really really solid evidence. But that being said, I have never seen anything very compelling for any miracles.
