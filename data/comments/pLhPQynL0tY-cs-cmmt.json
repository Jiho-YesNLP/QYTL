Though these were on the harder side I enjoyed the mathematical content.   Just some small suggestions -: 1. First just read the lecture notes of the perticular topic and then see the lecture it helps 2. after hearing the lecture using the lecture notes make your own notes 3.  If u find a lecture tough take a day gap and come back to it or skip that lecture and go back to it later", "votes": "10", "replies": "11", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pLhPQynL0tY", "cid": "UgyHQAcjimeOp_wviWB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you professor Adnrew and Stanford Online for this great course.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pLhPQynL0tY", "cid": "Ugz8TRHc5ARjtRbVssd4AaABAg", "comment": "Finished \ud83d\ude0c", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pLhPQynL0tY", "cid": "UgyqzaSZyw7mQjJW6wN4AaABAg", "comment": "Hey guys, if you've made it here, please share your insights about this series.
