End devices are the devices that are used by the users to access the network and its resources. These devices can include computers, smartphones, tablets, and other types of equipment that are used to connect to the network. End devices are typically located at the edges of a network and are used to initiate and terminate connections to the network. Examples of end devices include:  Desktop and laptop computers Smartphones and tablets IoT devices like cameras, smart thermostats, etc. Printers and scanners Gaming console Intermediary devices, also known as network devices, are used to connect and manage the flow of data between end devices and other networks. These devices are typically located in the core of a network and are responsible for forwarding, filtering, and routing data packets as they travel through the network. Examples of intermediary devices include:  Routers: which are used to forward data packets between networks Switches: which are used to connect multiple end devices to the same network Firewalls: which are used to control access to a network and protect it from unauthorized access or malicious attacks Load balancers: which are used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and ensure availability VPN concentrators: which are used to create and manage Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections In summary, end devices are the devices that are used by users to access the network and its resources, while intermediary devices are used to connect and manage the flow of data between end devices and other networks.
