Indeed, the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE (on\u00a0balance) !! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON\u00a0BALANCE. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or\u00a0BALANCED\u00a0with) the speed of light (c) (ON\u00a0BALANCE); AS\u00a0E=mc2\u00a0IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND necessarily) proven to be gravity (ON/IN\u00a0BALANCE).   General Relativity is directly taken from Special Relativity.\u00a0E=mc2\u00a0is taken directly from F=ma.

Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT.\u00a0E=mc2\u00a0IS F=ma.
