This is usually ignored as it is much lower than the concentration of acid we add into water.  But in the case of 10^-10M strong acid, it is actually the strong acid concentration that is significantly lower than 10^-7M and so we will ignore the contribution of the strong acid as insignificant.  So the [H+] is still approximately 10^-7M and the pH is still close to 7.
