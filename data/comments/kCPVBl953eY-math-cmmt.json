When \"angle x\" approaches 0 then the arc length \"x\" becomes equal to sinx, just as Professor explained in the video. But (cosx-1)/x is another nut to crack.  Let there be a single triangle made by the radius of the unit circle and the x-axis with hypotenuse \"H\", adjacent side \"A\" and opposite side \"P\". Let the angle made by the radius to the x-axis be \"x\". Now let's take a look at (cosx-1)/x  We know from Professor's explanation that Arc length \"x\"= sinx (when x approaches 0), so put the value of x=sinx in (cosx-1)/x, and we can write (cosx-1)/x as:  (cosx-1)/sinx Rearrange it as:  (Cosx/sinx) - (1/sinx) Note that (Cosx/sinx)=A/P and (1/sinx)=H/P {basic definitions}  (cosx-1)/x= (A/P)-(H/P)=(A-H)/P  Now take a look at Hypotenuse and the Adjacent side. As angle x gets smaller and smaller, Hypotenuse moves towards the adjacent and when x becomes infinitesimally small, Hypotenuse \"H\" will nearly become equal to Adjacent \"A\" ( or you can say that \"H\" will nearly superimpose on \"A\")  Therefore H=A for a very small angle x. So : (cosx-1)/x       =(A-A)/P=0  P.S\u300bI thought about sharing this because there were a lot comments regarding this problem.

The rigorous introduction of the subject is left to real analysis which I guess not all students learn. For me, analysis became clear once I looked into how the subject developed over time, how Newton/Leibniz saw the connection between the derivative and the integral. I always wondered why all those people were so busy with calculating areas and why the tangent was something they were interested in. Also, the limit process always looked as a cheat until the moment someone suggested it was a best approximation, the way to do away with infinity and replace it with the nearest best approximation.

For example, if it went to zero 10 times faster than the arc length, the limit would approach 1/10, not zero.   I'm comfortable with his argument about (sinx)/x going to 1 and have in fact used that argument to defend the \"small angle\" approximation in Physics. (Larson 3rd edition, pg. 81 however, gives a rigorous explanation using limiting cases of  triangular areas bounding the section of the circular area swept out by the angle, and then applying the squeeze theorem, (1-cosx)/x is left as an exercise.   But once you have the limit of (sinx)/x going to 1, just multiply top and bottom of (1-cosx)/x by (1+cos), the numerator becomes (sinx)^2  and the expression becomes:  [(sinx)/x] [(sinx)/(1+cosx)], first factor goes to 1 and the second to zero.

And there is another method we can do this intuitively. In the case where x approaches 0 in the expression of (cosx-1)/x, one can find the value of the expression using geometric intuition.  When \"angle x\" approaches 0 then the arc length \"x\" becomes equal to sinx, just as Professor explained in the video. But (cosx-1)/x is another nut to crack.  Let there be a single triangle made by the radius of the unit circle and the x-axis with hypotenuse \"H\", adjacent side \"A\" and opposite side \"P\". Let the angle made by the radius to the x-axis be \"x\". Now let's take a look at (cosx-1)/x  We know from Professor's explanation that Arc length \"x\"= sinx (when x approaches 0), so put the value of x=sinx in (cosx-1)/x, and we can write (cosx-1)/x as:  (cosx-1)/sinx Rearrange it as:  (Cosx/sinx) - (1/sinx) Note that (Cosx/sinx)=A/P and (1/sinx)=H/P {basic definitions}  (cosx-1)/x= (A/P)-(H/P)=(A-H)/P  Now take a look at Hypotenuse and the Adjacent side. As angle x gets smaller and smaller, Hypotenuse moves towards the adjacent and when x becomes infinitesimally small, Hypotenuse \"H\" will nearly become equal to Adjacent \"A\" ( or you can say that \"H\" will nearly superimpose on \"A\")  Therefore H=A for a very small angle x. So : (cosx-1)/x       =(A-A)/P=0  P.S\u300bI thought about sharing this because there were a lot comments regarding this problem.

His next point in the remark is, that if you take the limit at x=0, you can prove the two handy statements above. Therefore showing that (cosx - 1)/x goes to 0 and that sinx/x goes to 1 (USING THE LIMIT AT 0), he can then differentiate cos(x) or sin(x) using these nice facts.

Jerison just meant the analytical formulae of sin'(x) and cos'(x). Id est, if we know the formulae, clearly we can calculate the value of the derivatives at each point (all values).  In the beginning of the lecture prof. Jerison derived these formulae if only the hypotheses A and B were true (he hasn't proved them so far).   At the place in question he's just shown that basically sin'(0) and cos'(0) by definition are equal to l.h.s. of the equations for B and A correspondingly.   Hence, if only we would know the values of sin'(0) and cos'(0) somehow, we would get the derivative formulae proven.  The expressions are believed to produce 0 and 1 and that is being presumed almost implicitly. That may be a source of confusion from my point of view. Still there's no inconsistency as those are merely 'remarks', i.e. sort of intuition behind the derivation which could be clearly stated as (in a direct order of construction):  1 prove that d/dx sin (0) = 1 (using definition) 2 prove that d/dx cos(0) = 0 (using definition) 3 prove that sin x / x tends to 1 at 0 (using 1) 4 prove that (cos x - 1) / x tends to 0 at 0 (using 2) 5 derive sin'(x) and cos'(x) (using 3 and 4)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "kCPVBl953eY", "cid": "UgiWy-epdBJohXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-9jNU8pXz4hqDfQP", "comment": "You are supposed to 1) have an IQ over 125 to even be there 2) contact tutors 3) use the recitations 4) study and do the problems", "votes": "10", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "kCPVBl953eY", "cid": "UgiWy-epdBJohXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-9jNU9cQTBhLEzCd", "comment": "He's at MIT, not high school.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "kCPVBl953eY", "cid": "UgiGAH068tB8bngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-8rFC7-W5ePGFNuW", "comment": "hahah", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "kCPVBl953eY", "cid": "UgjE92ArrPILkXgCoAEC", "comment": "Formulas?
