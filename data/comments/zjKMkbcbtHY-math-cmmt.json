This one uses both the product rule and the chain rule together.  Given: x^2*ln(x^5)  The derivative of the ln(x^5) part uses the chain rule.  To remember the chain rule, just treat the Leibnitz notation as a fraction.  Given f(g(x)), its derivative is df/dg * dg/dx.  As you can see, dg/dg cancels, and we're left with df/dx.   Treating Leibnitz notation as a fraction doesn't always work, so you'd need a more formal proof to show that you can do it, but in this case it does, and there is a formal proof to the chain rule.  Thus, we evaluate: derivative of outer as function of original inner, all times derivative of inner function.   d/dx f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))*g'(x).  Inner function: x^5.  Call this g. Outer function: ln(g) Derivative of outer: 1/g Derivative of inner: 5*x^4.  Drop the exponent by 1, and have old exponent join the coefficient.  Thus: d/dx ln(x^5) = 5*x^4 * 1/(x^5), which simplifies to 5/x  Again, recall the chant: \"First times derivative of second, plus second times derivative of first.\" first function = x^2\r second function = ln(x^5)\r derivative of first = 2*x\r derivative of second = 5/x  Construct product rule result: x^2*5/x + 2*x*ln(x^5)  And simplify: 5*x + 2*x*ln(x^5)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zjKMkbcbtHY", "cid": "UgwdV4r80z3PQlr4CWx4AaABAg.9J0GHO3cPDb9R3vdOnzqL7", "comment": "The x is outside of the ln argument.

Due to the fact that there are no parenthesis to indicate the input to the logarithm, you proceed until you get to the next operation, and assign that as the input of the function.
