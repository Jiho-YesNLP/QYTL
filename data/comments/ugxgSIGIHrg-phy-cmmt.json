I have focused on your channal for a long time and I have a small but vital problem after watching this video. It is related to the fomula that used to calculate the delta volumn of an object that under the surface of the water. In this fomula, there is a P, and you call it pressure. The question is that this pressure refers to the pressure on the top of the object or the bottom of the object if the object is so large (but compressible) that the change of the height is not negligible. Anyone can answer my question if you understand what I mean and have a relative correct comprehension and solution of my question.
