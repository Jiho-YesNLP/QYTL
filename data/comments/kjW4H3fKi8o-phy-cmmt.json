In my experience the place where most errors occur is the calculation of the parallel resistances. Students make errors on the calculator entering all the numbers. I now teach product over sum which has a far greater success rate. For anyone who does not know  two resistors in parallel can be calculated by multiplying the two values together and then dividing by the sum of their values. So lets say 2 resistors     4 ohms & 6 ohms.    (4 x 6) divided by (4 +6) = 24 divided by 10 =2.4 ohms. For 3 resistor just calculate an equivalent value for the first 2 and do the calculation again with the first answer and the third resistor.
