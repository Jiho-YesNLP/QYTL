Any help would be great.Thanks in advance,Oxygen has six electrons in its valence shell, while magnesium has two. Both can reach stability when magnesium donates two electrons to oxygen. This results in oxygen becoming an anion, and magnesium becoming a cation, which then stick together.

If the Kardashians are not coming from geosynchronous satellites, then why can an antenna staring at the sky receive them, whereas, if it is aimed elsewhere, it does not receive them?

Tell that to Sisyphus.  I think you mean kinetic or potential energy.  In order to use up energy without doing work, you have to create entropy.  If you include entropy, you have to use deltaG = deltaH - T * delta S as your definition of Energy.  In the case of :Darko's engine, I was being charitable by assuming a reversible system: no entropy.  In an irreversible system, output energy (work) = input energy - heat loss - T*entropy gain.

There is an amazing variety of fascinating scientific subjects.  High school science classes, necessary though they are, barely scratch the surface.  Geology, Parasitology, all the  biomedical fields, psychology, I consider History a kind of science ...  Perhaps you will make a profession of some branch of science.  Whether you do or do not, please remain interested.  Subscribe to Scientific American, American Scientist, Sky & Telescope, etc.  Search Youtube and the WWW for videos and courses.

I can't know what is available in your area.  Your teachers are in a better position to know.  Ask all of them.  Teachers get stuff in the mail, and by email.  The only way to find out what they may have is to ask.  Don't worry if you are not in their class.  Teachers always love a student who is interested in learning more.

Really threw himself into it.  But, he took some biology classes and found he was even more interested in that.  After a couple of years of Chem Eng, he decided to switch to PreMed.  His Chem Eng prof gave him Hell for it, but he switched anyway.  Now he is in his fourth decade as a physician, specializing in Nephrology.  He is also a Full Professor at a major medical school.  He still swears his introduction to chemical engineering was the best possible background for studying kidneys.
