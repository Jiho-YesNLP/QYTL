The jokes are distracting, and for me and i'm sure a lot of people, annoying-even if it was a good joke, because it distracts from the information and you have to try and think about the concept from the beginning all over again. For me i have to replay things multiple times a lot of the time to go back to try and connect the relevant concepts. I get why the jokes are there, cause creators think it would be boring without them, but a lot of people would prefer it that way- i wish there was at least one channel that had the helpful animatics and that was all it was.

Yes, actually Human beings are capable of using certain cells from other organisms. A lot of species can use certain cells and structures from other species- however, there are many limitations because of differences in blood type, cellular structure, enzyme functionality, and molecular components. But, it is possible.  (The next two things don't answer your question, but I thought, eh, they're cool enough to be worthy of saying)  It's also possible for animals to use parts from certain organ systems in other organ systems. Dogs, for example, have had parts of their intestinal tract cut and used them to replace a part of their esophagus (a large portion), and within several days the intestinal-esophagus worked as well as the original, and within a few weeks you couldn't tell the implanted esophagus from the first one.  There is a very popular hypothesis in biology that mitochondria, the energy producers of the cell, were once their own separate prokaryotic cell that was 'consumed', per say, in another prokaryotic cell. And this would have to have happened very early on in the history of life because nearly all cells have mitochondria, and the structure of mitochondria seem to indicate an ability to have once survived on their own.

I've been watching your videos for quite a while and I don't really have any money to help you so I thought I'd give you a story instead. Read if you wish. :)  I don't know when the love of science took hold in me, but I know I was young. Through time and life, I found myself drifting away from that. A few events, and a change of scenery later, I find myself in college for the first time, at age 34. This is relevant to you because when I decided what areas I wanted to study, I came upon your Biology and Chemistry courses. They were the best and most entertaining I found, so I kept watching. I did your whole Biology course thus far, and when I first stepped into my Biology class, I learned that I could have passed the final exam that day. That is how amazing you are.
