They are a pro religious organization.  Their research showed that in most cases, there is zero impact of prayer. But there was ONE situation in which they noted a statistically significant result.  When people KNOW that they are being prayed for, on average, their outcomes are WORSE than the control group.   So, if you really want to reduce someone's chance of recovering from that heart surgery, just tell them that the whole church is praying for them. There will be a certain percentage of people who believe that prayer will help, so they don't give a full effort at following the doctors suggestions for recovery...and why would they? They firmly believe that their church has cast a magic spell, by talking as a group to an invisible super hero, and they are \"humble\" enough to think that the most powerful being ever is going to change their \"perfect plan\" based in the temporary wishes of a few dozen people who want reality to be a little different than it is.   Seriously....I'm so tired of being surrounded by this type of \"problem solving\".  I'm glad you're trying to learn complex topics, truly I am.  Keep your magic out of the lab. I'd really like to not return to the era when people like me were burned because they pointed out things like \"Prayer is not a reliable tool for problem solving.\"  You mean well, I know.  My great grandma was old enough to have met someone who sat in a jury for a witch trial. I met my great grandma.   Think about that.  Given the right location, I'm one person away from having been able to talk to someone who sat on a jury, in America, where someone was tried as a witch.   Just because religion is far more tame than they use to be, that is no reason to forget how they behaved when they had all the power.   So please, keep your religion out of my science class.

The specific heat capacity of water is 1 degree Fahrenheit per pound.  What that means is, if you want to raise the temp of H2O 2 degre F, then you need to add 1 BTU worth of heat energy.   However, there is an extra cost when you cross a phase transition, like going from ice to liquid or liquid to steam. I wont give you the specific numbers, because they won't be important unless you're trying to cheat at a specific question.  But...I WILL tell you that to go from 32f degree ice to 32f degree water require ABOUT 200 BTU instead of one. To go from 212f degree water to 212f degree steam is ABOUT 900 BTU instead of one. This is why phase transition is such a powerful way of moving energy.  You can go cut a block of ice from the mountain and put it on a train and ship it to a city where an \"Ice man\" makes deliveries every day to people who have \"Ice boxes\". And it's because ice has over 20,000% more cooling power than 32f degree flowing river water.  This is why huge cities run apartments on steam radiators. For every pound of steam that is moved to the radiator you get over 900 pounds worth 212f degree water.  It takes a LOT less energy to move 1 pound of steam than 900 pounds of hot water. Phase transition is everything.  The point your professor was trying to teach you was that a lot of energy can be stored in the phase transition of materials. Be it water or steel, the same basic concept apply.   Yes, I used Fahrenheit on purpose.  Ive spent the time to break down what your teacher was trying to teach you.

Let me explain it to you in simple terms while not making this complicated. You see heat is nothing but a form of energy. Energy can be of different form like heat, chemical energy(petroleum), sound energy, radiation etc.  Whenever you give energy to some object, electron inside the object start vibrating, hence resulting into collision of atoms or molecules of the object. This collision of particle of object results in increase of internal temperature of object. Now coming back to your question, when we applied high energy electromagnetic waves, according to E = hv( Planck equation), electrons inside the object absorb this energy and rise to an exciting state( in simple terms they start vibrating). Due to this vibration of electrons which results into increase in temperature of an object. The best example of heating with electromagnetic waves is laser. You see by laser( which is nothing just electromagnetic wave) we can increase the internal energy of object which in results causes the burning.

If infrared light is a form of energy then it's made of photons but what form of energy comes from a cup of hot coffee because that doesn't emit light? Light has a speed but what if the speed of heat energy? It must have a speed because the heat is coming from the sun though empty space.

In electron this displacement is nothing but vibration. And as far as your hot coffee mug radiation energy is concern, when you boil the water for making coffee, you have given the chemical potential energy of LPG gas ( assuming you cooking in cooking gas) to coffee. This energy is then absorb by water molecule and they start vibrating. And then with adequate vibration, they were able to breakdown Hydrogen bond intermolecular and started rising into gases phase. And this water vapour pass down the energy by interacting with other molecule of air, hence energy is transferred to surrounding. As far as you speed of energy is concern, energy can have any given speed given by circumstances. Like it can have static speed egs( electrostatic energy, chemical potential energy) or it can have speed like(kinetic energy). In short energy is nothing but amount of force to move an object with distance x.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "LR5bYxC4syI", "cid": "Ugy_nRF93WBEZZsQ9R54AaABAg.961jAmZnr7w9B_wek5AcUj", "comment": "\u00a0@kaustavsengupta8757\u00a0 I think you didn't get my question here... I asked you what exactly is heat energy? You only know about vibration but why the molecules vibrate from heat energy? Why the coffee cup radiates heat if it's not emitting any light or electrons? Here are 2 questions: 1) Why the water molecules of the coffee cup starts vibrating when heat is applied? 2) Why the heat energy is present even after when the coffee cup is kept on the table? Now... you said heat is energy but in case of a microwave oven, there is no chemical heating but only microwave radiation is used.
