He totally ignored all the violence in northern cities from Irish and Italian immigrants. He totally ignores the fact that Indian tribes all across North America were hunter gatherers and nomadic.

The warrior tribes routinely attacked the passive tribes killing the men raping the women and making the women and children slaves. He totally ignored that there were many Amazonian & Central America tribes and cultures that were extremely warrior oriented and that slaughtered other civilizations.   You can find warrior tribes from every culture all across the globe throughout the  history of mankind, including all across Africa and all across Asia..  And when he talks about the people that moved to the American south and Appalachian mountains etc. from Ireland and the Highlands of the UK such as whales & Scotland and how violent and aggressive those people were. Those people were extremely anti-antiauthoritarian not because they herded sheep. But because the English monarchy had been persecuting them for hundreds of years! I\u2019m sure you have heard of the Irish potato famine and how that drove over a million Irish people to America. Here\u2019s the truth they don\u2019t teach you in school. The Irish did have a fungus that killed a tremendous amount of the potato crops for multiple years in a row. But these kind of things are cyclical all over the globe in agrarian society\u2018s. The reason so many Irish were dying during the potato famine is not because they didn\u2019t have enough potatoes. It\u2019s because the King sent the military into Ireland to take all the potatoes to feed the English. Therefore, when the Irish and the highlands Scots and the people from Wales and even other parts of the UK came to America especially to the south or to the Appalachian mountains which run well up into the  northern states, these people were extremely oppressed extremely poor and had been treated worse than slaves in many ways for hundreds of years by the English.

The university uploads lectures like these because they don't see them as valuable, and they believe putting the lectures online would provide more benefit as marketing than education. There's two main reasons for this. 1. This is a 100-series, freshman-level course. It's meant to be accessible and not excessively technical. This gives it a low academic value by the administration, information that does not require a high level of education as a prerequisite, which is therefore less valuable information and can be made available to students who might drop out or even the unwashed masses. 2. The value in a university education, as far as the university is concerned, is the degree. Degrees exist as a class system for the labor market, degree-owning managers will limit job positions to other degree-holders and which have a nepotistic preference for degrees from universities they see as reputable relative to their own. There are careers which do require extensive post-secondary education of course, but there is also no shortage of jobs that don't care what field a degree is in or where it came from, only that the candidate holds a degree. The university only sees value in the course credit that leads to a degree, the information in the lectures themselves is essentially worthless and can be disseminated freely. As further evidence, look at how frequently senior university staff will vehemently defend their professors, even against accusations of wild academic fraud or criminal activity. They don't do it because they believe so strongly in their academic staff, but because guilty professors effectively devalue the credit for the courses they taught, degrees given out with that credit, and the university's greater prestige. The fact that the actual education and information value has collapsed under scrutiny is irrelevant, it's all about the degree. This is why academic review is done by peers, and why fraud is usually called out and affects the professional field, and the universities will typically fight against the accusations even against all logic or evidence. As a contemporary example, look at the crimes committed by Sam Bankman-Fried's parents, both Stanford professors, and look at the university's reaction, giving them both paid leave and keeping them on the staff. We also don't get the reading or the assignments. Degrees, at least graduate and undergraduate degrees, are earned by following instructions because that's how you keep bringing in tuition regardless of any student's actual aptitude. Deeper understanding is usually not relevant to graduate-level degree programs.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "UgwTz9lWE7gKLudsdjV4AaABAg.9KpmUyN0KVx9KyoWNm_e-B", "comment": "Your intolerance of intolerant people is breeding hate :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "UgxdvWromAf6LoOIFL94AaABAg", "comment": "The used riddle postprandially coil because atom neuroanatomically pine with a deeply male. future futuristic, watery plywood", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "UgxXoa-WFxZnjhMwJqx4AaABAg", "comment": "Funniest episode, but also the most inaccurate/incomplete studies", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "Ugz2bIfoVDrBIqiStWl4AaABAg", "comment": "That last 15 min !

We unconsciously make decisions without knowing that we are subconsciously doing risk benefit analysis, however conscious awareness of risk benefit analysis as a skill for addressing daily choices is extremely beneficial.  \r \r Awareness of Self, in the context of the forest, does not prevent another blunder, \u201cas opposed to a girls that grow up with boys as brothers \u2026as opposed to plants that are brothers..\u201d\ud83e\udd14\u2026is a skill to allow for a  \u2018reset\u2019\u2026and is an indication of advanced cognitive awareness\u2026. \r As opposed to a simpleton that blurts out stupidity, while being totally oblivious of the content of the confusing messaging!?~#", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "UgwhwZZJnRMUljdc1JF4AaABAg", "comment": "The ending is so great and wiseful.

We appear to be individuals in a larger society of individuals. b. What is best for an individual may or may not be what is best for the larger society of individuals, and conversely, what is best for the larger society of individuals may or may not be what is best for the individual. c. The larger society of individuals normally outlasts any single individual. d. Hence, the larger society normally gets their way in the end as the larger society is normally still existent while the individual is dead. e. Over time, those that support doing what is best for the larger society outnumber those who focus only on the individual.  (Basically, natural selection). f. Eventually, a society of individuals who support doing what is best for the larger society of individuals over doing what's best for any single individual would be the natural direction of a society.  (Side note:  The USA's Republican party often focuses on doing what's best for the individual whereas the USA's Democratic party often focuses on doing what's best for the larger society of individuals.  Also, as the Republican party would tend to focus individual wealth over a small amount of individuals, there would be more middle class and poor people in the larger society.  So, in a fair and free democracy, where every valid voter gets a vote in a system of self governance, the Republican party would tend to suppress the American citizens inherent right to vote whereas the Democratic party would try to ensure every valid American citizen would be allowed to vote.  Eventually though, the Democratic party would 'win' and eventually do what's best for the larger society.  Even rich and powerful people still die one day from something while the larger society would still be in conscious existence.)  But now also, since we are individuals in a larger society of individuals, we have to exist somehow, someway while we do all exist.  If a choice had to be made concerning a certain topic, who's 'best' should take precedent over the other's 'best'?  If for an individual, which individual?  All individuals?  If for a larger society of individuals, which larger society of individuals?  A certain group?  A certain state?  A certain nation?  A certain species?  All species in existence?  Which larger society?  And who decides?  And by what authority do they and they alone get to decide?  This natural tension between the individual versus the larger society of individuals, who decides, and by what authority they and they alone get to decide, is the cause of much strife, suffering and death in this world.  But still, as individuals in a larger society of individuals, how do we all want to exist while we do exist?  And who decides?  And by what authority do they and they alone get to decide?  Are we going to sit down and discuss these issues or fight it out with our aggressive tendencies?  And who decides?  And by what authority do they and they alone get to decide?  (And for those who believe 'might makes right', does that mean that bullies in school are okay?  Mass murderers are okay?  Genecide is okay?  Is that the society we as a society want to have?  And if 'might makes right' is not 'right', then what exactly is 'right'?  And who decides?  And by what authority do they and they alone get to decide?)  And then no matter what is decided, it currently appears by analysis that: 1. We are still ALL going to die one day from something. 2. We are still ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced. 3. We are still ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.  Life itself is all ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things as one day there is not going to be a conscious entity left from this Earth to care about anything or anyone ever again throughout all the rest of future eternity.  But still, while we exist, how are we all going to exist?  And who decides?  And by what authority do they and they alone get to decide?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "UgwpJ4vSeD0QmAg5f1t4AaABAg", "comment": "Wish I knew Prof. Sapolsky in person.

Many people utilize religious beliefs as an excuse to harm and kill others.  (Consider the following copy and paste from my files):  GOD DOES NOT ACTUALLY EXIST.\r \r For those who claim God exists, consider the following:\r a.  An actual eternally existent absolute somethingness truly existing.\r b.  An actual eternally existent absolute somethingness that has consciousness, memories and thoughts truly existing.\r \r People who claim God actually and eternally exists basically are claiming that 'b' above is correct but yet simultaneously seem to be saying that 'a' is impossible to occur.\r \r 'a' above can exist without 'b' existing but 'b' cannot exist unless 'a' exists.\r \r I am one step away from proving God's existence, but am unable to find any actual evidence to do so.  And nobody I've talked to seems to have any actual evidence of God's actual existence either.  Hence, at this time in the analysis, God does not actually exist except for as a concept created by humans for humans.  Humans have personified Nature and called that personification \"God\".\r \r \r In addition, while modern science does not know what consciousness actually is yet, memories and thoughts appear to require a physical correctly functioning brain to have those items occur.  Where is God's brain?  Where are God's memories stored at?  How are God's memories stored and retrieved?  How does God think even a single coherent thought?\r \r \r If inside of this space time dimension we appear are existing in, then where?\r If outside of this space time dimension we appear are existing in, then where is the interface between that dimension and this dimension?

An absolute somethingness cannot come from absolute nothingness, absolute nothingness just being a concept from a conscious entity in absolute somethingness.  So, an absolute somethingness truly existed throughout all of eternity past, exists today, and will most probably exist throughout all of future eternity.  As modern science claims that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, hence, either energy is truly eternally existent, or modern science is wrong.  And if eternally existent, then the absolute somethingness that eternally existed is most probably energy itself.  And if my TOE idea is correct, and I fully acknowledge the 'if' at this time, the gravity test still has to be accomplished for that portion of the TOE idea, but 'if' true, then the 'gem' photon is the eternally existent energy unit of our existence.  Basically, the universe ALWAYS existed in some form and NEVER had a beginning, and most probably will ALWAYS exist in some form and NEVER have an end.

If the most fertile women get raped most often, this strongly suggests that rape is about reproduction. Would it be about power and subjugation then rapes should be more evenly spread over the age of the victims - which is not the case.

It has been interpreted as a natural/genetic/epigenetic incest avoidance trait. It occurs in other animals sharing early development. The rule is not set in stone when there is NO chance for outbreeding, though. The absence of attraction appears in species whose primary sensory social input is more olfactory, leading right into Sapolsky's recognition of neurohormonal information theory.  Over 100 years ago, the phenomenon was proposed by Edvard Westermarck, but the two studies within kibbutzim were quantitative, and discussion seems to have isolated a reduction in sexual attraction, but not repulsion/aversion. In the larger study something like .05% - a bit over one-half of one percent married/reproduced together.  Other studies of early childhood social intimacy seem to support the validity. As I mentioned, other, nonprimate, species also share the phenomenon. I have not followed primatology (the Rhinencephalon is heavily repurposed and subsumed by other social/cognitive  perceptions in primates, although it is clearly connected to conscious/choice response in other animals. There is more to say about Anterior Cingulate and Posterior Cingulate Cortices in cognition than was intimated in this series. Some brains far larger than human have large CCs, and although we cannot measure activity in other animals without inducing inordinate stress, we may expect that structure and near-identical transmitters and hormones may indicate very similar cognitions), but am also interested in incest avoidance and kin recognition occurrence in many species, as humans have severely, genocidally, taken many, many wild species populations down to 5% to 1% of original numbers, fragmenting their habitat so much that isolated subpopulations have become the norm.  I note that in many of these persecuted species, that social interaction is relatively unknown, and many complex social interactions are reappearing in some slightly rebounding populations. Insofar as those studying human psychology are concerned (I regard it as a necessary prereq for understanding other species, as more thoughtful and intimate study has been done on the human social animal), it points to the massive aberrance from, or extinguishing of, evolved behaviors under stress, analogous to the \"unwanted children\" theory mentioned in earlier lectures.", "votes": "14", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "BqP4_4kr7-0", "cid": "UghWuUB9StKUqXgCoAEC.86CEh-IU5NJ8Dx0O9NWfhe", "comment": "Wow, I really appreciate you taking the time to write such a detailed response.

But Enid's response to the young Sapolsky explanation of his lecture focus on aggression, stimulates mention of some variable human psychosocial/emotional response:  Although familiar with Dr. S. references in most spheres (neuroscience & epigenetics require much catchup, as they are moving fast, and it is six years after these lectures), yet other findings he was unable to address in detail could be added in comment:  Good hypotheses have been made for depression, to which I subscribe; not a Gouldian spandrel, but in Sapolsky's own disciplines having evolutionary validity, sadness and depression have a protective benefit in social species. It stimulates focus on the event and its relationship to what is understood by the one who experiences the shock and consequent sadness, as well as some social withdrawal and affiliative seeking (this varies in individuals and species). Fred Luskin must have been well-known to Bob Sapolsky there, and the cultural characteristic of prominent release of vengefulness the two researchers experienced is not shared by many traditions.  From Siberia down through hugely contrasting pre-islamic \"honor-killing\" cultures, to buddhistic and Jainist to the ancient 60,000-year-separated Aboriginal exo-social rituals, across to Native North American cultures, we find such a huge variability in cultural response to violence, that anthropological exploration for possible answers to vengefulness can be of abiding value. Traditions of long-persisting cultures, and ecological bases for them offer answers unavailable to those bound by their own cultural views and violence.  Traditional humans created superior within-group cohesiveness through social normative pressure. As I mentioned to a psych mentor when studying Siberian peoples, they had no need for modern psychology,  medicine, and other technologies (getting myself totally cut off! ), because they had superior - wiser - social traditions.  The Algonquian people now known as Yurok  understood that violence and rage-murder resulted from both the perpetrator's and the victim's failures. Thus the murderer had a social debt to the family of the victim (intragroup murder being essentially a male phenomenon there on the Klamath) .  Olekwo'l (Yurok) tradition taught that both parties failed to resolve differences, and were equally at fault. The gifts of work or supplies to the victim's family was equivalent to their estimation of what the family member/victim would have been. It seems that no defection (game theory term) by the victim's family was socially appropriate. Remember, this small distant fragment separated by half a continent from its relatives, was a tightly-knit community of relatives.

Stanford Med has been where I recommend many people with neurologiccal problems and injuries.  It is rather unethical to claim bias merely because one has refused to have exposed oneself to a sufficiently rigourous education and criticism. Rand was a fiction writer, with some severe psychological problems, somewhat visible in extant interviews, and is not comparable to rigorously scientifically educated individuals, who have been career-long subject to intense criticism.  The comment to which I respond is indicative of common failure of rigor or criticism, psychological biases and heuristics which are severely weeded out in social sciences. This failure is increasingly documented in populations and individuals now unrelievedly stressed by mixtures of overdensity, . Ours is a species that becomes rather violently heirarchical when exceeding the natural evolved social capacities of the organism.  I hope Sapolsky will have elaborated more on the hyaenid social phenomena witnessed over in the Berkeley Hills. Humans are no less subject to analogous strictures on behavior in spite of relatively little research done from objective  viewpoints on the primate species. Comparative social psychology has some validity; some specific primate research has exposed roots of the volatility exhibited in the comment.
