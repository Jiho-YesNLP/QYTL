And i forgot to say, the syntax used in places like at 9:33 is based on BASIC, a very good beginers programing language (It's like an old precursor to python and similars), if you want to learn graphics you could try QB64.

It's a bit arcaic, but it would also make you apreciate a bit more the comodities of modern programing languages, there are a few tutorials on QB64 here in youtube, but keep in mind that you are not likely going to be using QB64 for any serious comercial aplication any time soon, it's just a way to explore programing old school style", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "Ugz1XL1astIEY3kw1-F4AaABAg", "comment": "let brainState = \ud83e\udd2f", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgwVC4WioTO-xZmbMop4AaABAg", "comment": "Amazing, thank you!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgyAI5cMDVnlGeAWrWd4AaABAg", "comment": "Amazing video", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "Ugx6dy6WdL8hF1rIJah4AaABAg", "comment": "0:59 is that a touchscreen ???", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgxgOo-KEMOxh0filJZ4AaABAg", "comment": "I learn  computer science in school but its soo, like the teachers don't have your energy, they are bored, I come on youtube many more times to undestand how things work because they are unable to teach us properly =)))", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgzEKkh6lUHw_iec3xx4AaABAg", "comment": "5:29 oh my god it's just like the pen from scratch", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgwWdCZmlihs2GNEsW54AaABAg", "comment": "Great video", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgwG48_9gBmIUnN8DEJ4AaABAg", "comment": "What branch of mathematics was most useful in designing graphical user interfaces?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "Ugzcf3tcC0ZkS6gJEzJ4AaABAg", "comment": "this series is exactly like the intro to computer science class in college", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgzEE2Js7RXIIa4New14AaABAg.9A6-8BKyumQ9A8LKaJXD5X", "comment": "Ali M\u00fcrteza Ye\u015fil I\u2019m with you man", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgzTscu2A6WW4A9qrTh4AaABAg", "comment": "I always thought that VRAM stood for \"Vanilla RAM\"", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7Jr0SFMQ4Rs", "cid": "UgwiJqgvwTQuUml5Osh4AaABAg", "comment": "This course is amazing.

One of the smallest early computers was the LGP-30 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGP-30) which had a drum memory with special tracks as registers. A built in oscilloscope CRT could show the contents of the registers as waveforms since the computer processed just one bit at a time (so each register was a single wired that had to be looked at).
