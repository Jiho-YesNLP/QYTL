If I were arriving to this video lecture series with  \u2018NOT a lot of previous learning\u2019, but with only a few biochemistry related synaptic connections in my brain, I too would be distracted. \r \r Even with previous background knowledge, when a new slide is displayed, I pause the video, study the content on the slide, them resume playing the video and listen to what the prof has to say, while also \u2018taking in\u2019 her various arm and body movements.\r \r For example, with arms spread, the prof makes one side-step\u2026 she is mimicking the polymerase sliding one codon along the DNA strand. She is internally \u2018visualizing\u2019 and displaying what she has already stored in her long term memory; a visualization that a new learner is trying to decipher and internalize in short term memory, for later long term storage.\r \r That is where sidebar audio statements interjected into the lecture content, within the continuous verbal flow, can become distracting. \r That is where a deliberate side-step to mimic the polymerase, gets confused with other random bodily movements.\r \r As a subject matter expert, the slides, the lecture, and the movement, cognitively flow together fairly coherently.  For new learners, especially for learners that tend slightly toward attention deficit, the changing and switching of sensory input (especially in the online videos) is going to draw attention away from focus on the main content\u2026not great \u2018survival value\u2019 for a classroom learner. However in the wilds of a forest, being intensely aware of random movement has huge survival value\u2026just like keen awareness of movement and communication on a basketball court is an advantage.\r \r The prof, herself was taught in classrooms with mainly or only blackboards\u2026computers with animations with audio and visual synchronized is relatively new\u2026and still is not being used in science education to the fullest. However, students sitting in the lecture hall have the advantage of continuous display of content on the projected slide, most of the content on all the sliding blackboards showing, while listening\u2026the classroom students have the advantage of selected focus\u2026and also pre-read handouts. \r \r Actually, great lecture preparation!\r \r However, as subject matter experts, many lecturers have to slow down delivery, and pause between concepts\u2026to give their own brains \u2018like\u2019 time to \u2018like\u2019 catch up \u2018Ya know\u2019 \u2026especially when speaking to students being introduced to content for the first time. \r Even blabbergasting comedians, pause to let the audience get the simplest of \u2018jokes\u2019!\r \r We live in a technological society that uses flash advertising, not for understanding, rather for simple product recognition. \r We also live in a culture that overvalues verboseness\u2026\u2019We have mouths that close and ears that stay open\u2026that should teach us something.\u2019 Compare sports broadcaster banter, to an articulate JFK speech! \r Love the MUTE button!", "votes": "8", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "apP5SWitnyw", "cid": "Ugz8p2if2yj5qX-Wm_14AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks mrs.
