Dividing by \u0394x and taking the limit as x\u21920, we instantly obtain: uv' + vu' + u' x 0 = uv' + vu'. It's more logical that way, and we can clearly see why the formula looks the way it does.  We can of course make the process lengthier by writing instead of \u0394u and \u0394v their full expressions:  u(x+\u0394x) - u(x) for \u0394u and  v(x+\u0394x) - v(x) for \u0394v. By doing so we get: (u+\u0394u)((v+\u0394v) - uv = [ u(x) + (u(x+\u0394x) - u(x)) ] [ v(x) + (v(x+\u0394x) - v(x)) ] - u(x) v(x). And the proof will take more space, while it is still gonna be exactly the same as the two-line proof I have written above. In fact I believe students should practice both writing the short proof and the longer version just to clarify things for themselves.   Now then, by knowing the end formula (uv' + vu'), we of course can prove it as in this video by trying some adding and subtracting tricks to make the end formula uv' + vu'.
