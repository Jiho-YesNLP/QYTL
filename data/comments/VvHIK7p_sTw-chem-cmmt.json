He had earlier added 8H+, which made the left side total of +7. In order to compensate (since the right side was then 2+, so thus unbalanced left and right), he added 7e- to the left in Step 5. This would make things balanced now. But then he went and added 2e- to the right side to neutralized the Mn2+ . . . but why? Didn't he already compensate for that when he decided to add 8H+ to the left earlier?    He said he was trying to balance left and right, not make every side neutral, right?  I just feel like I'm not able to make those decisions when doing a complicated problem like this on my own :-/ It's overwhelming seeing the big picture. I'm trying to follow the rules like he says, but in my mind, what he's doing isn't matching what he says he's doing (even though I trust that he's doing it all correctly)...but that makes it hard for me to be able to do it on my own.  cries", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VvHIK7p_sTw", "cid": "Ugg8RLSZnpCiFHgCoAEC", "comment": "Your logic in all subjects you teach is very clear!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "VvHIK7p_sTw", "cid": "UgjaP3413M87xHgCoAEC", "comment": "Brilliant explanation!
