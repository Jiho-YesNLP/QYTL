Of course, most chip-and-PIN readers will, if they fail to properly read the chip, revert back to letting you swipe the card again and using it without the chip. And that's a problem: if someone can copy the magnetic stripe on your card, say with a skimmer, then they can easily create a chip-and-PIN card with an intentionally damaged chip, letting them spoof your card and thus remove the \"what you have\" authentication step. Instant vulnerability.  Luckily, it's basically impossible to copy your magnetic stripe if you never swipe your card, so using the chip all the time can prevent such an attack from happening. On the other hand, at least at my job, the card readers fail to read chips properly about 25% of the time, and that means quite a lot of people still end up swiping their card.

But longer passwords are more likely to be forgotten, so some large organisations might choose to restrict password length to reduce the burden on their customer support lines. If they can send you your password upon request though. Yeah, that's completely indefensible. They might be able to email you your password immediately after you first set it (although that is a terrible idea because email is a terribly insecure protocol) without compromising database security, but at any other point they should not have access to your plaintext password.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "bPVaOlJ6ln0", "cid": "UgyLzKDGnAHSRiBoGs14AaABAg.8YaQJa0OqlE8Z6mRCyxUEK", "comment": "@Jim Cullen you're right.
