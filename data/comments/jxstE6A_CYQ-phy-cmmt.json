The friction and resistance you are referring to is called dampening, and when there is dampening in a system it is no longer considered as 'simple harmonic motion', it is called 'free damped motion'. The differential equation in this case becomes x''(t)+cx'(t)+w^2x(t)=0. So I hope that answers the first part of the question. As for why the bridge keeps moving it's because the motion started to resonate. To describe the motion of the bridge when people were walking on it we can use the 'undamped forced motion' equation, which is x''(t)+w^2x(t)=Fsin(at) where a does not equal w. The right side of the equation represents the force applied and its periodic nature, the left side is just the equation from before ignoring dampening as you already mentioned it doesn't seem like its doing a lot. I know it sounds like a lot so far, but bare with me. The solution to this equation assuming no initial displacement or velocity before the force was applied is x(t)=(F/2w^2)sin(wt)-(F/2w)tcos(wt). Notice the t term in front of the cosine term, as time goes this term will get larger and as this term gets larger and larger the amplitude of the displacement will get larger and larger. As people were leaning in to the sway they were also increasing the F term which would only further increase the displacement. If that was all too complicated in simple terms, when structures start to resonate they are really hard to stop and impossible if the loading that lead to the resonance is sustained.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "jxstE6A_CYQ", "cid": "UgixEakrfPxdrXgCoAEC.8GbYAroU0jH8GbajyWodA0", "comment": "..i dig her hair, she's a female einstien that's terminally pretty.....", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "jxstE6A_CYQ", "cid": "UghQyYJX5gana3gCoAEC.8GbWsyLS5Mu956XBhKtBmL", "comment": "@Unsung Songs I'm assuming because engineering is simpler than physics", "votes": "33", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "jxstE6A_CYQ", "cid": "UgjT5izCfcixKXgCoAEC.8GbViR9IyCU8GbbKe3e_JS", "comment": "..you gotta be joaquin.. if you already know this, why are asking her to slow down...", "votes": "54", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "jxstE6A_CYQ", "cid": "UgjT5izCfcixKXgCoAEC.8GbViR9IyCU8GbcTuF3uS1", "comment": "Youtube already provided the speed control in the settings.", "votes": "33", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "jxstE6A_CYQ", "cid": "UgjT5izCfcixKXgCoAEC.8GbViR9IyCU8GbdF1JUhTE", "comment": "Greg Miller Yes, I am Joaquin.
