It is thereby emitted in the same fashion as the sun, at tolerable levels determined by earth.   If an individual were to think of this as a 1,2,3 rarefied process, the 1 would be the initial establishment of equilibrium at the core, providing orbital patterns.

Lemme address your Newton/GR question (because it's the easiest).  Newtonian gravity is actually a subset of general relativity, not a separate theory.  In every gravity experiment that we've ever done, general relativity has been able to explain the results.  But, the equations of general relativity are complicated, and you don't want to use the full machinery of GR when you don't have to.  In certain situations (like, where objects are moving at low speeds, and gravitational fields aren't very strong) the equations simplify to Newtonian gravity.  In those cases, you use Newtonian gravity, because it's way, way easier.  So, anything that Newtonian gravity can do, GR can do.  But the reverse is not true.

Or maybe even 2D, and just like computers, we simply project the x dimensional world we live in to 2D and use perspective to see it like it's 3D.  The delay might mean we see a single point (what does that even mean) at a time, and our mind is too slow to delete the old points from the memory memory that you see (again, I will compare it to computers: it unloads the memory you see to the one in your brain you can remember), so new memory is being added and it looks like you are seeing a lot of things at the same time.
