And then you dove into the underlying quantum mechanics, you could formulate the physics of the molecule in terms of these alternative \"orbitals\", and it would be equally valid! But you can only pick two at a time. Once you pick any two different combinations, those two will already span the space of the possible molecular electron orbitals at those low energy levels. Then, any further choices are redundant - any other \"orbital\" at those low energies would simply already be a linear combination (including possibly a shifting of phase) of the two combinations you picked.  This is analogous to how if you're trying to orient yourself in 2D space, and a-priori there isn't an \"X axis\" and a \"Y axis\" defined, you can freely pick what direction you choose to call \"X\" and then can freely pick any different direction to call \"Y\" (ideally a direction perpendicular to X, but you could even pick \"skew\" axes if you want!). Then after that, there isn't any more room for a third axis. Any third direction you pick within the same 2D space would just be some combination of the two you already picked. Still, any choice of X and Y would be equally valid and let you navigate.  In the case of the molecular orbital here, however, any of the \"intermediate\" choices of combinations between \"completely in phase\" and \"completely out of phase\" are not constant in energy. In quantum mechanical terms, you can work out that they aren't eigenfunctions of the wave equation for the electrons around the molecule. This means that although you could pick any two intermediate combinations as you describe to be your \"orbitals\", and it would be equally valid as a physical description of the electrons around the molecule, the occupation of these \"alternative\" orbitals by the elections would constantly appear to be changing and oscillating in a complex way. It wouldn't let you easily analyze the stability of the bonding of the molecule, because what matters for the bonding stability is the energy level of the electrons, and these alternative \"orbitals\" wouldn't correspond to single clean energy levels.  To draw a loose analogy with the 2D space again - suppose the 2D space you're trying to navigate is a city, whose city blocks are laid out in a strict rectangular grid of streets and avenues. Imagine you chose your X and Y axis to be directions that were skewed and misaligned with the city grid. Mathematically, it would be equally valid to express the motions of cars within the city grid in your alternative system, but it would be more complex. A car changing its \"street\" coordinate while moving along a constant avenue (if we suppose that the constant \"avenue\" is analogous to an electron with constant energy level), would in your alternative axis system be changing both it's X and Y at the same time in a more complex way. And although your alternative axes would still be just as valid for describing the car's motion, it would not let you as easily analyze the avenue of the car (bonding strength of the molecule) as it moves, compared to if you just chose X and Y axes to be aligned with the streets and avenues.
