This all makes sense as energies are scalar quantities and so are dot products. If you were to express work done as an integral it would be: \u0394W = S F \u2022 d s Where S indicates the integral sign, F is the force vector and d s is an infinitesimal distance vector. If you're not already aware, vectors are often expressed in bold or underlined.  Feel free to ignore that if it's a bit technical, but it will be really helpful if you plan to continue studying physics or a similar discipline.   Moments, however, are like shorthand torques. They are vectors, unlike energy. If you consider the right hand rule for electromagnetism, it's basically the method for working out a cross product, (in this case your thumb denoting the direction of the torque vector, index finger r, middle finger F) In vector form, the cross product formula for torque is: \u03c4 = r x F Where they're all vectors, (r is distance). I recommend looking up a diagram of torques or watching a video to get an idea of how this cross product works if you aren't already familiar with it. (If this video isn't helpful enough on its own). A little extra for you is that a torque is a circular force, which can do work. However, since the motion is circular, it can't do work in a given direction, but in a circular path, over an angular displacement which is measured in radians. Radians don't have their own dimension. So while torques have the dimension (unit) Nm, it's also kind of accurate to say they have the unit Nm/radian. (I don't recommend answering this in an exam setting, it's probably not what they're looking for, but hopefully helps your understanding).  Essentially, if you've got an exam question on this, the answer you're looking for is to basically say that a moment/torque is a vector and behaves like a circular force. However, work done is a scalar and is defined as the force that acts over a given distance, in the direction of that motion.  (They are defined differently. There is a difference between an algebraic formula, and the more accurate vector formula. The units are only algebraic Nm and Joules are used for the sake of making this distinction clear. Work is force through a distance, torque is force at a distance.)

I know the question was asked a year ago but I still wanted to answer - the \"pyridine\" part is actually a special unit or a number in maths. A simple mistake, Pi is confusing.  The radians system that he uses(you can see him writing \"251.33 rad\") is used for measuring rotations. In this radian system, 1 rad is connected to the radius so that it doesn't really matter how big the wheel is, the number will always represent the same amount of rotation. Due to using the radius, the numbers get all weird and 'inaccurate' with the decimals(251.33) so mathematicians use the trick of having a multiple of Pi. The measure of rotation 251.33 is equal to 80 Pi's. And so he calculates @2:32 that if 1 full rotation(or a 'revolution') is 2*Pi then 40 revolutions is equal to 80*Pi. (Pi is a number approximated to 3.14 in easy examples).
