When I was in school, we had to write a program in HTML/JS exactly like this. We used a 3x3 grid, using randomized numbers, 1-8. You played by clicking on the number and the code would check for a valid blank square adjacent to the chosen number and move the number to that space or just give a notice that wasn't a valid move. After each valid move, the code would check to see if the numbers were in sequence and if so, announce it.  I've played games like this a million times as a kid, so I cannot see how in the heck he's saying that there is no solution.  This reminds me of a Numberphile video where they said that the sum of all positive integers from 0 to infinity is  -1/12 and they did so because of some twisted mathematical \"logic\".
