Arrhenius is being spelled Irainous which is heinous and 100% erroneous and the lecturer makes the point A is for Arrhenius, e for ln and Ea for Activation Energy!  Even more seriously as an ardent student of Pedagogy or Andragogy does she not worry that only half her students do not understand that A and Ea do not vary with Temperature in K? The clicker result should not be any excuse for steaming ahead with half the class asking \"what did I misunderstand?\"  Come on MIT!  AND at 38 minutes   K1 and k1 appear to be used but K2 in a chemical equation?    The student who say \"we crossed off the ... \" is not developing her chemical explanation rather using a lazy mathematical way of speaking about the effect of something being near zero.  \"Who likes that explanation?\" might be a good question for the lecturer to ask the class at that time...that way everyone benefits and the student answering gets immediate feedback.
