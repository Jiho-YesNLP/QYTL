Seriously, I noticed the lack of viewers on this.  It's just a case of people being afraid of math.  Kudos to everyone who watched the whole thing. 7:20  This is why mathematicians hate physicists.  \"OK, let's set the speed of light to 1 with no units.  We'll put it back in when we need it.\" 15:40 You can think of the \"free variable\" as integration in calculus.  When you take the derivative of an equation, you lose the finale constant.  When you turn around and integrate the equation, you an add a constant of any value.  IRL, acceleration is the derivative of velocity.  Going the other way, velocity is the integral of acceleration.  So what's the +c?  It's your starting velocity.  For example, you are in your car and accelerate 1 kph/sec.  So how fast are you going after 10 seconds?  One bit of information is missing, that is, your initial velocity.  It's the difference between hitting the gas when the light turns green, verses hitting the gas to pass a slow poke.   However, this matrix math can only be solved for integral values, which pretty much is basis of quantum mechanics,  As I've told people before, you really can't understand the whys and hows of QM without doing the math.", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TQvxWaQnrqI", "cid": "UgyhuL6ochenQL2hl4h4AaABAg", "comment": "Why you cut your hair?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TQvxWaQnrqI", "cid": "UgzJRi83Vyr5k4CQnQ54AaABAg", "comment": "Great explanation.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TQvxWaQnrqI", "cid": "Ugz5z0V3490B8gpQYu54AaABAg", "comment": "Love the haircut", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TQvxWaQnrqI", "cid": "UgzVD8eJ0uCgF7QE89Z4AaABAg", "comment": "Only tuned in because the words have a German component to it.", "votes": "1", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TQvxWaQnrqI", "cid": "Ugyse_p7JXXfCv9JVzF4AaABAg", "comment": "Today I learned that \"eigenwaarde\" and \"eigenvector\" translate very simple from Dutch into English.", "votes": "9", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TQvxWaQnrqI", "cid": "UgzkYxGg7S8xJgj7uvh4AaABAg", "comment": "I need to go back and learn some more before this, but I still watched the entire video.
