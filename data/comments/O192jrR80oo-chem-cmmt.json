Mixed class, some non Chemists or people with little previous exposure to chemistry (can assume they know like charges repel, and electrons orbit a positive nucleus) but also some Chemists with good knowledge of \"how to\"  2. I doubt any student can articulate \"why\" because in the entire series so far (a) no inquisitive audience questions and (b) clicker answers 80%   3. Style: introduce a highly complex symbolic representation of orbitals that is not maths, but Chemistry. Saying S (has max 2) and P (has max 8) ... is like saying the fundamental building blocks have these characteristics.    4.  What is being taught: The (apparent) behaviour of some of the smallest real things - things that cannot be observed directly - and that the explanation is useful as a predictive tool.  5. When the advanced student knows  5. I think we are asked to believe S is simple, spherical and omnipresent around every nucleus, P has an \"like S\", and an X, Y and Z \"real plane\" dimensional component ... which are possible, i.e can be defined once the bond direction is established   for some reason electrons like to pair, we call this spin up or down...but it's not really spin or rotation  There are some more rules like the electrons can't occupy the same space with the same spin so they change spin? Or they only come together to form bonds when the spins are compatible.  Question: is it a statistical distribution or could any two atoms combine?  5. All this an no mention of the nuclear forces or scale of the physical space.  no-one asks Why do the electrons not collapse onto the nucleus?   Oh, what? 58mins in and we invoke some Divine Principle?!  whenever X then \"God Creates\" X' orbital?  What \ud83e\udd23 is she saying? 1. The orbital exists for all atoms, but is not filled? 2. The orbital exists but might be filled, statistically it has very low  potential to accommodate electrons 3. The orbital is brought into existence by the increase of atomic number (more protons?)

Basically two thirds of the class did not understand the metaphor of happier...or the reality of energy conservation (and I presume thermal enthalpy dissipation?) so what is the point of teaching by metaphor here?   Once they get it wrong the lessons progresses by insisting on the \"sweet spot\" analogy idea rather than more degrees of freedom or more \"space\" to occupy or whatever it is that confers a lower energy level on the electrons - and introduces an up down concept that is yet to be explicit.   These are notes as I go along. They aren't meant to be hyper-critical it's just that I've come to MIT online for an explanation when no-one has previously provided me one.  Dirac (a Bristol lad with Asperger's?) has something to say I believe?  Ok so now we are 24 minutes in and considering the bond order of a nonexistent He\u00b2.  It's dawned on me that the \u00b2 superscript has nothing to do with the square of the probability wave function, but rather is Chemistry notation not maths. Also we had a diagram of superposition where the difference of the energies has a negative value (this is not a square of probability? because that would be positive) and the whole plus or minus thing is totally confused in my head because the graph appears to have nothing to do with electrostatic charge.  Jeeze this is one confusing subject.    And Bond Order: why take half?  It's not because \"always there is a half\" that's simply a way of remembering the definition.  The whole BO concept is presented as gospel before it's defined...  And then He\u00b2 does exist but with a bond 40,000 times less strong than H\u00b2 - discovered 1990s - so what does that mean?  Given enough time and low enough temperatures all the He will end up as He\u00b2?  Fate of the universe stuff?  Presumably most He falls into stars before it cools enough to form He\u00b2.
