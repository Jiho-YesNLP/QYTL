They were about to go deep-sea diving. Their hearts beat faster as they dived into the indigo ocean. Their mouths nearly fell open at the mesmerizing sight below. Dozens of fish swam everywhere. Queer plants were situated on equally peculiar rocks. The two boys explored the ocean feeling exceedingly thrilled. They found an underwater cave. Feeling inquisitive, they decided to enter it. All of a sudden, there was a glistening flash of light. The next moment, they were sprawled on their backs. They seemed to have reached a cove. \u201dWhere are we?\u201d Asked John. \u201dNo idea\u201d, Steve replied. They removed their diving gear and set off in search of a cave. When they had found a suitable cave, they entered it. They were bewildered to stumble upon an aged man wearing scruffy clothes. The bedraggled man gave a crooked grin. \u201dWho are you?\u201d questioned John skeptically. \u201cI am the spirit of an ancient pirate.\u201d responded the man. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. I just wanted to inform you about the treasure.\u201d \u201dTreasure!\u201d the boys cried in unison. Their eyes lit up with enthusiasm. \u201cTell us about it!\u201d they demanded. \u201dAll right,\u201d the spirit began. \u201dWhen I was a juvenile buccaneer, I raided a Portuguese ship on its way to Brazil. My mates and I collected the loot. But on our way to the Indian Ocean, tragedy struck. Our ship caught fire. I dived into the sea, taking the treasure chest with me. I reached this island through a cave. I have lived here till my demise. Then I turned into a soul. But a dragon stole my treasure. I can\u2019t retrieve it because dragons\u2019 fire can disintegrate souls. Will you get the treasure for me? I\u2019ll only take a particular gemstone which brings me back to life.\u201d The boys reluctantly agreed. \u201dWhat\u2019s your name, by the way?\u201d \u201dTeach. The name\u2019s Edward Teach, \u201c was the reply. He handed the boys a special sword, which could kill the dragon, along with a special potion to blind the dragon.\u00a0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "UgiQ7tc6G3FLuXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Riqm7-H2STtpHvs", "comment": "OMG", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "UgiQ7tc6G3FLuXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Riqm7-H2XLoUBXN", "comment": "NO WAYS HOSE\u00c8!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "UgiQ7tc6G3FLuXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Riqm7-H2aT9Oway", "comment": "ITs spelled jos\u00e8", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "UgiQ7tc6G3FLuXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Riqm7-H2n3c18_D", "comment": "YOU ARE A JOSE!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "UgjXPjNPxfytVngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Pw8270ExWrChXFt", "comment": "Not for the time - with better nutrition, the average person has gotten a lot taller since then.

Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released from the adrenal medulla when it is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (neural stimuli) when the body is experiencing short term stress (exercise - anxiety - shock). Which brings to the next point - Glucagon is mainly released to maintain homeostatic range of blood-glucose levels when an individual is fasting. When an individual is doing \"push-ups\" this triggers the short term stress response - by the sympathetic nervous - and thus the key hormones in this situation would actually be epinephrine and norepinephrine - which stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenisis (amongst other things) thus increasing blood - glucose levels for muscle cells", "votes": "58", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "UghOknUZuWFH1ngCoAEC", "comment": "This video goes too fast.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "Ugg03wiWXsqOJXgCoAEC", "comment": "Thank youuu !!!! love your vids I wish you were all my professors. lol", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WVrlHH14q3o", "cid": "Ughk8fZhq8FElngCoAEC", "comment": "How gerl get pregnent?
