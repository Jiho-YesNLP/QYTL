The plant is a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae.[2]\r \r Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated (\u00a7 History) by Native Americans independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic studies traced a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there approximately 7,000\u201310,000 years ago, from a species in the S. brevicaule complex.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.\r \r Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas by the Spanish in the second half of the 16th century. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[8] Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes.[6] Over 99% of potatoes presently cultivated worldwide descend from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[9] The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production during the 21st century was in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world production of 376 million tonnes (370,000,000 long tons; 414,000,000 short tons), as of 2021.\r \r Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible for human health, but, if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.[10]", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "26QPDBe-NB8", "cid": "UgxjXInoK6Wf7V8oC1x4AaABAg", "comment": "this channel is simply amazing. i was looking long time for some quick explanation of what filesystem is without goign too much into detail, but all i found is comparisons which are better but not what FS actually is. and then there is this cool channel", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "26QPDBe-NB8", "cid": "UgyqT2OJ9u5gWMVHGK94AaABAg", "comment": "What is atlas supervisor", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "26QPDBe-NB8", "cid": "UgygoRU4ovXbLILYTvt4AaABAg", "comment": "love the video! learn more from this than 8 hours studying :) btw where can i get the t-shirt?!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "26QPDBe-NB8", "cid": "UgwaDqNCl2Up4eP4aQh4AaABAg", "comment": "Great video!

One of the reasons I now use Linux and MacOS (a Unix derivative itself). Windows 7 I did find visually appealing and was more stable than previous iterations, but nevertheless using Windows is as annoying as ever. Whenever you install a program, you always run the risk it will alter the OS so the next time you boot up, you get some error message. Oh, and it's especially vulnerable to viruses. Only recently did Microsoft provide basic antivirus as standard along with the OS. Embarrassing. Windows Vista and Windows 8 were prime example of half-baked underdeveloped versions of Windows that should have never been released.", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "26QPDBe-NB8", "cid": "Ugw-cGQIPWN4DAai3-B4AaABAg", "comment": "Host: \"Virtual Memory...\".
