And suppose it's the best university in the world, how can you make people(best students around the world) buy your idea. It's a simple concept, how do you prove yourself, why MIT rather than tons of university around the world and that where this OCW pops in, also as the first-mover.

That's not really news nor is it controversial. That aside, there are other top schools with free courses available, but not to the extent of MIT's OCW.  It's worth noting that MIT has for a very long time had a culture prone to open-sourcing. Their famous hacker culture is the epitome of this. Hell, RIchard Stallman, probably the foremost pioneer of open-source (or at least it's more extreme cousin, free software but that's only more to the point) was at MIT for decades, and did his work from there.   Universities are not as profit-motivated as your average corporation. While they certainly look out for their budget, most professors (the people who run the University) don't care so much about money as they do about their fields, and often personal prestige. I don't necessarily disagree that part of their motive is exposure, but really a lot of this is well-intentioned.   At some point you have to ask yourself: why not? Putting these courses up really doesn't cost MIT anything, it does good, and it's great for optics. Gilbert Strang and others have put a ton of work into courses on here, and they have little to gain. Potentially selling (emphasis on potentially) some books isn't going to make Strang's final years on this planet much better; the man is probably far wealthier than his wants demand.
