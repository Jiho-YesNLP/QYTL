Since you get another negative sign the original subtraction turns into addition...?", "votes": "1", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w4CZ0V6a50g", "cid": "UggONshHFxpz2ngCoAEC", "comment": ":D subscribed! you're a great teacher!", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "w4CZ0V6a50g", "cid": "Ugj_bBa4lLzIfHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ndnl8IPuzSX44CJ", "comment": "I was thinking the same.
