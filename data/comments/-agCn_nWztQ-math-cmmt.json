The book gets it right.  You don't change the first row of the matrix K, which is the row that corresponds to u1.  Instead, you add a new row to the top of the matrix, which corresponds to u0.  This should be obvious: since we don't have the boundary condition u0=0 any more, we don't actually know what u0 is, so we have to add a row to the matrix to figure it out.  That row has 1 and -1 followed by all zeros, because it is the 2nd order accurate boundary condition he has just discussed.  To correspond with that new row, and the addition of u0 to the solution vector, we have to add one element to the right hand side, with the value 1/2.
