Flux of like charges add up while Flux of opposite charges relocates. On closing  a DC circuit electric flux  in the conductor relocates by  exiting   the conductor radially due to opposite charges on both ends of conductor. This establishes an electric field in the conductor which exerts force on charges. This force moves only electrons as they are lighter & loosely attached at the surface of conductor. This establishes  current in the conductor. After initial increase the electric field becomes constant at which flux leaving the conductor stops. Initially moving & changing electric flux induces circulating & changing magnetic flux around the conductor. As electric flux stops, motion of magnetic flux also stop. On achieving equilibrium electric field inside conductor and current flow becomes constant and a circular static magnetic flux of constant density is established around the conductor.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5fqwJyt4Lus", "cid": "UgxpFhWMTVNIuIEqMhl4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you !

I understand though\u00a0why they did'nt do this in the video as it demands more advanced knowledge of vectorcalculus than a 8 minute video can provide.   talking about the B-field in terms of a vectorfield (a function that in a point P maps a direction and a magnitude of that direction instead of normal \"scalar\" function that only gives a value Y in point P) gives a more complete\u00a0picture on the subject. A line integral sums all\u00a0contributions of the B-field\u00a0\u00a0along a line L (sums the magnitude of all mapped points along the line, that is parallell to the line)\u00a0. If you close that line creating a loop you have amperes law. You can shape this loop however you want the; law still stands as long as the B-field is defined along the entire loop.   One conclusion you can also draw from this integral is that of the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. One of the most fundamental laws of electromagnetism says that there is no such thing. If you create a small sphere somewhere along the created loop and say that this sphere, because it is close to a source of magnetic flow, must have a flow through it. if you calculate this magnetic flow (also called flux) you will always get 0.\u00a0This essentially means that as much flux that flowed into the sphere also flows out summing it to 0.\u00a0This does not mean however that the line integral will always be zero.   The opposite of this would be\u00a0the electric field. There is such a thing as an electric monopole for example a point charge. The\u00a0electric field will be directed outwards in every direction from this point charge which means that if you create a sphere around the point charge and sum all electric flow through it you will get a non-zero answer, in fact you will get total charge inside that sphere. This is called the gauss law for electric fields and is essentially the electro version of the amperes law.   Because of the point charge and the fact that the electric field is directed outwards around it, a really cool conclusion can be made. If you create a loop around a point charge and perform a line integral around it you will always get zero because The field will always be perpendicular to the line or if it isn't, the non-zero\u00a0contributions will be\u00a0neutralized by the\u00a0equal negative contributions somewhere else on the line. If you \"un-close\" the loop however you have the formula for electric potential also known as voltage.
