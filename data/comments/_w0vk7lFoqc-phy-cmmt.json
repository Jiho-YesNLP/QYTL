You don't speak with a respectably known language. You seem to have been creating new words for definitions that fit your concepts however you don't have any connection to the person who doesn't know anything yet. After all, the rate at which electricity flows is constant, as far as I've been told.  Frequency is  a constant, so how can you push the frequency any faster without changing it? So the rate of change to the direction of which the magnetic field is traveling or pointing relative to the charge traveling on its field, would be the frequency that makes up alternating current.   Oh, and the more I think about it, shouldn't frequency of direct current be zero point five? You know, since it's half of the step to a complete sine wave? Sometimes, god gives you a sign? I think it's spelled sine. But who's able to claim godliness anyway when the word god is just that program in your head that dictates how you think, the fact that you do, and not much more?   A kernel program.     Little nugget of joy.
