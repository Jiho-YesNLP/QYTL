If the upper limit is less than the lower limit, then the integral outcome is simply the negative of what it ordinarily would be.  When the upper limit is greater than the lower limit, the integral indicates positive area above the curve, and negative area below the curve.  Vice-versa when the limits are switched.  An application of reversed limits of integration, is work done by a gas (positive) and work done on a gas (negative) in an expansion or compression process, like you see in the theory of operation of a car's engine.  The process is represented as a path on a pressure (vertical) vs volume (horizontal) graph, and the area under the path is the work done by the gas.  If we always put the limits of integration in increasing order, then we would always get a positive area on this plot.  This is consistent with the gas expanding and doing positive work.  But, when the gas is compressed, there is work done on the gas, so the work needs to be negative.  And it is consistent with the way the process happens, since we integrate from a big volume to a small volume to make it negative.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b0RJkIBhfEM", "cid": "UgypdCiyGbrZ205h4nV4AaABAg.9Yhq7O_F22q9gzgzH3AHbZ", "comment": "\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 Thank you.

Some classes will give you problems such as \"find a function F(x) whose derivative is f(x).\"  By virtue of stating the problem with the indefinite article \"a\", no matter what you make the constant of integration, or even if you omit it entirely, you've technically answered the question correctly.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b0RJkIBhfEM", "cid": "UgxNOs24HO9KyyiGIh14AaABAg.8fUZ3QHYo4z9UyfGRBS9Nm", "comment": "\u00a0@bvolpato\u00a0 One example where it there is value in keeping track of the constants of integration, is in the theory of structural beams.   When finding the deflection curve of beams, you often need to evaluate double integrals of integrands such as \"k*x * (L-x)\", where L is the length between supports and k is a constant from the problem specifics, and its details are a topic for another day.   This is for a simple supported beam with a uniformly distributed load across two supports length L apart.  Evaluating the double integral, we get y=-1/12*k*x^4 + 1/6*k*L*x^3 + C*x + D, where C and D are arbitrary constants of integration.   We want y to equal zero at x=0 and at x=L, because the supports fix the beam in place at these locations.   We then solve our two equations for the unknowns, and get D=0 and C = -1/12*k*L^3, which allows us to construct the equation of the elastic curve as  y=-1/12*k*x^4 + 1/6*k*L*x^3 - 1/12*k*L^3.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b0RJkIBhfEM", "cid": "UgwF1I0LBBwYM-Ral_R4AaABAg.8fTg87EvjXn8fTk1Nk4HWL", "comment": "it gets reduced!", "votes": "9", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
