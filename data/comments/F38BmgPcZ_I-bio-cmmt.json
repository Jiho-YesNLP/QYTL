Cladistics classifies all things by their evolutionary history, into clades. Evolutionary history is inferred through phylogenetics. So phylogenetic studies are what inform cladistic classification.  There's not much of a difference between a cladogram and a phylogenetic tree. The differences between them are not super well defined like their parent ideas. One way to explore the differences would be to considered almost characterized ideals of two extremes, however real diagrams in real academic journals are in the grey between these two.\u00a0A cladogram is usually more concerned with relationships than anything else, and usually has little supplemental data. A cladogram will be made to look pretty and/or exemplify relationships at the expense of distorting or ommitting other information. A phylogenetic tree is more concerned with the information that was used to infer relationships. Branch lengths are usually proportional to some trait of interest, and other information such as confidence in support of nodes may be present as well. As a general statement though, a phylogenetic tree is a kind of cladogram, which is why trying to differentiate them seems so tricky.  Speciation is a process in evolution. Evolution is defined as just, \"change over time.\" Biological evolution specifically how life forms, species, change over time, and how new species come into existence. In life it can most simply be said that there is diversity, and complexity. Genetic/genomic are responsible for how a species descendants can be vastly different from ancestors. Geneaological processes (which define speciation), combined with genetic/genomic processes are responsible for why there are separate and distinct populations, different species!
