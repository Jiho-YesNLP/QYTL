So, I've a quick question regarding 'self' in Python; it looks like while defining the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) in a class, we can replace the Python keyword \"self\" by pretty much anything. Is this correct, and if yes, then I'm a bit puzzled by this. Please look at this code below I wrote by slightly playing around with your Python code: where I replaced each occurrence of \"self\" by \"other_variable_than_self1\", \"other_variable_than_self2\", \"other_variable_than_self3\" etc., and kept using this new \"other_variable_than_self\" in the constructor init and the methods 'introduce_myself' and 'noworries below'. By doing this, I was expecting an error because, as I understand, the keyword \"self\"  really is really like a function that outputs an object with inputs specific values of name, color, weight. But why did I not get an error when I replaced self by \"other_variable_than_self1,2,3\" in the code below? Thanks so much in advance!  class Robot_man:     def __init__(other_variable_than_self, n, c, w):         other_variable_than_self.name = n          other_variable_than_self.color = c          other_variable_than_self.weight = w      def introduce_myself(other_variable_than_self2):         print(\"Hello, my name is \" + other_variable_than_self2.name)         selfo=other_variable_than_self2         print(\"Hello,\" + \" my color is \" + selfo.color)         print(\"Hello, my weight is \" + str(selfo.weight) + \" kilograms\")              def noworries(other_variable_than_self3):         print(\"No worries, as \" + str(other_variable_than_self3.weight/2) + \" kg is light\")            r1 = Robot_man(\"Tom\", \"red\", 30) #r1 is an object, i.e. an instance of the class Robot r2 = Robot_man(\"Jer\",\"blue\", 50) #r2 is an object, i.e. an instance of the class Robot r3= Robot_man(\"Jon\", \"green\", 70)  r1.introduce_myself()  r2.introduce_myself()  r3.introduce_myself()   r1.noworries() r2.noworries() r3.noworries()", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8yjkWGRlUmY", "cid": "UgzIUgzCTtWtrN4TZu14AaABAg", "comment": "plz make video on matplotlib , beautifulsoup, seaborn how to use in python", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8yjkWGRlUmY", "cid": "UgwK1gv-UM1e-xW6xNR4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you very much for help as to  learning programming by  python with easy way", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8yjkWGRlUmY", "cid": "UgzRrXrzIr6fM0RC5Wp4AaABAg", "comment": "Best explanation ever heard.
