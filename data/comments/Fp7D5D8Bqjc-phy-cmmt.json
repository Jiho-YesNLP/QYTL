It comes out as the exact same, unless this doesn't work in specific occasions and therefore your formula may be better  I have not yet looked at the solution, but this should work with 2) as well. Maybe it's good to show newton's 3rd formula to help comprehend, but why would I ever learn a new more complicated formula than just use that? Unless it's the same but presented differently.

I'm assuming the momentum (kg x m/s) stays the same, so since the weight increased from 200kg to 250kg, it's 1.25 times slower. So either 200/250 or 1/1.25, which is 0.8. So it's 0.8 times the original velocity, which is ((15/5) x 4 = )12m/s.

The time of collision is the same for both masses, but the net force is different since the impulse or change in momentum on the 2 kg mass is 10 kg*m/s and the impulse or change in momentum on the 1 kg mass is -30 kg*m/s.
