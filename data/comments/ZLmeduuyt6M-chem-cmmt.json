Other notable examples of amphoteric anions that are more acidic than basic include HC2O4-, H3P2O7-, and H2AsO4-.  There is no set of rules here that doesn't have exceptions, and there is no way of knowing these except to look up their Ka values and to calculate the corresponding Kb values to see if they are more acidic or more basic...or pure memorization.  So I stick with teaching the general trend and include a common exception students are likely to encounter (well knowing there are others).

The trend you site is the trend for binary acids such as HF, HCl, HBr, HI.   The longer the bond to hydrogen, the weaker the bond and the more likely it is to dissociate...so the stronger the acid.  But when we talk about the acidity of cations, we are not talking about binary acids or of anything bonded to hydrogen at all.  Rather, we are talking about the ability of cations to act as electron acceptors (Lewis acids).  And the smaller the cation, the greater its charge density and the greater the 'attraction' to electrons.
