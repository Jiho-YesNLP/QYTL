Actually, red-green color blindness is considered both an example of X-linked recessive genetic disorder and sex linkage.  The gene for color blindness is located on the X chromosome, making it a sex-linked trait.  Additionally, the inheritance pattern follows an X-linked recessive pattern, where males are more likely to be affected due to having only one X chromosome. Females can also be affected if they inherit two copies of the recessive allele. If you have any further questions or would like more information, I'm happy to help clarify.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "IHkShmHVdpk", "cid": "UgyfOB94x4i0qS-PArt4AaABAg.9rT7lCQln3b9rYoSqxOF8W", "comment": "Hello!
