Yes, an integral will give you the area between the curve and the horizontal axis BUT (and it's a big but here), those areas under the horizontal axis (that is, the vertical axis has negative values) will count as \"negative area\" (I know, I know, an area can't have a negative value, but bear with me).  What I mean is that the values for the different areas under the horizontal axis will be subtracted from the values of the areas above said axis. For example, if your equation between points A and B has 5 area units above X and 3 area units below, if you just do the integral from A to B, that will give you 2 as a result instead of 8. To do it right you first have to see if A and B have positive or negative values and find all the different Pn points in X ( A<=Pn<=B) in which f(Pn)=0 (or, in an easier way to understand it, all the points in which the curve \"cuts\" X, that is, when the value of the curve equals zero).  So, you would actually have to calculate the integrals for the intervals A-P1, P1-P2, P2-P3, ..., Pn-B, which will have (in an alternate fashion) positive and negative values. You will have to change the negative values into positive ones and then add them all together.

I really think the absolute BASICS of physics should've been talked about for like three episodes, using only the most elementary of equations before moving on.  This went so far so fast with words that aren't really familiar to most high schoolers and even graduates.   I took physics, I took calc.  But it's been 10yrs since I've used it.  So I feel like a newbie again, but do still know the information.  And yet this feels like nothing but words and headaches and none of the Crash Course-y \"Okay, that probs just made you crossed-eyed, lets break it down in a way that makes sense\".  And without that, how's this any different from class/textbooks that no one likes and are inaccessible?  How we're into full equations, and calculus stuff by episodes two and three without explicitly describing all the fundamentals of physics at length, or even how people discovered those things (like in astronomy and even philosophy - though the \"who\" naturally comes up more there)....is mind-boggling to me.   I can't even imagine how people are going to stay engaged even in the way physics is being applied, but given that so many people struggle with physics based on its reliance on math...?  Pffft, we went cannonball-style into complex math.  That's... not how CC usually goes into things.  I feel lost and I KNOW this stuff.  Given how much physics is SO huge in life?  This just is like a math class with a word problem that looooosely relates life.  I'm really surprised a compleeeeetely different approach to this wasn't taken.  Usually, with CC we'd at least get a... \"Okay.  So, you're stuck and only have a window to escape.  [quick story about your peril] How on earth are you going to get down? Can you jump without falling? Do you know how high you are? How fast are you going to fall, and would the force break your bones if you tried???  Welp! Physics can help you with that! [cue intro]\" Followed by an episode using or teaching about all those things with the story involved from a personal standpoint.  This feels like an Episode 10 or 12 kinda content when it comes to Physics.  Integrals??? On episode three??  We haven't even gotten a hardcore truly deep explanation of basic things like force and velocity and gravity and energy and exertion and units of speed and...all of those!  Just a couple quick definitions and then moving along super fast using all those at once together instead of understanding each independently.  Why would you even mention Calculus already??  Some people don't even graduate HS with that class EVER?  I mean, I get its necessity in physics, but we JUST started.  I feel like this just lost a massive amount of the audience who'll be too intimidated to even try to come back.  The people that already know and love it and are into this?  Yes, ofc they're going to dig it.  But CC is about accessibility and giving knowledge to all skill levels.  ..while also going into super complex stuff where beginners can pause and digest if they need.  But we've not really given them the basics.  I'm so confused by the intent here.    If 28yo's who have done all this can be overwhelmed and struggle to follow.  I have no idea how a high schooler who only just began or hasn't taken physics is going to have any idea what you're talking about.  Particularly when, in most schools, they start with algebra 1 or 2, geometry, and maybe get to trig by junior year - unless on an advanced track.  Some kids in my HS didn't even get to Physics before graduation (Earth/Space, Bio, and Chem) bc they hadn't had the math required to understand this before graduating.  But still there's TONS of physics to be taught and learned and devoured with more simplistic math to start until you work up to higher levels.    I know these tools are important to move ahead, but not only did we jump into anything-but-basic material already on episode two, it doesn't feel at all like CC -- just a class... like \"do this, cuz this, then, that? get it. good. cuz i do. easy. moving on\".  But it also doesn't do Physics and why it's SO fascinating much justice.  I can imagine (and HOPE!) some of that's coming, but the couple introductory episodes should really hook people in to being like omgggg, that's so cool! I didn't know this mattered in all my sports and driving and running and pouring a drink.  ..or that I could figure something like that out myself!  This really IS everywhere.  We just socked em over the head with Calc and probs made them go \"ahhhh what the heck physics is awful why would i ever do that or need that or not just get a measuring tape or use google if THIS is what it requires me to figure out?\"  And, that makes me very very sad. :(", "votes": "41", "replies": "5", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jLJLXka2wEM", "cid": "Ugh2ZndkGBQwZngCoAEC", "comment": "This is great!

These videos are designed to be used as things teachers can show in class to reinforce learning, not as something that will take you from zero to being able to do it yourself in 4 minutes. They in fact even told us at some point which American Physics course it is based from. If you don't even feel comfortable with the idea of an equation, you really aren't going to understand anything about an introduction to Physics, so it's kind of a no win situation for them. Other Crash Course series have required very little background knowledge in other subjects, so they could get right on with it. Astronomy is a great example, as you can just talk about stars and galaxies and that's cool (at least at the level of the CC series). Same with Biology, Chemistry, Psychology, English Lit, History, you can just get straight into the subject matter at a nice basic level and build up.

I feel like Math should've been first if they were going to do this.  But the thing is?  You're suggesting they \"want to get on to some real Physics\".  And I agree and can see that.  But, they also do use this in classrooms.  High school classrooms, not just college. Most schools?  Only the accelerated students take Calc before graduation.  And most take it in their senior year (some smartypantses junior).  You cannot \"get on to some real physics\" without calculus. ...and you absolutely cannot teach Calc in a hot minute.  So, basically no one in most high schools will ever be prepared for this.  And high school Physics teachers won't be teaching THIS kind of Physics.  Ours didn't.  My college Physics classmates' high schools didn't seem to. I took all advanced classes.  I look Physics as a Junior and Calc as a junior.  Only twenty kids in my school were ready for Calc that early, so those who were in Physics that you, none of us had had Calc yet.  That ENTIRE class was still important, amazing, wild Physics.  It was valuable and opened my eyes and other people's eyes.  It didn't even TOUCH what has been touched on in episode three.  We broke down all the laws of physics and how they're applicable to life, did equations and complicated problem solving.  And it wasn't easy.  And none of us were stupid. By the time I took a college Physics class?  Yes, we got to this.  But even there, not without TONS of review first.  ..bc a lotttt of those kids didn't get physics in high school either.  The people who are ready and understand can digest and follow; but those who can't, can't even continue because they weren't given the basics.  There were many CC series where the first three were pretty elementary and then we took off super fast.  That's perfectly cool.  But I worry by episode two, anyone who was interested was like, hell no, I don't even know what she's SAYING, I'm gonna skip this one.  And that's sad. With literature and history? They've continued on, done it in chunks.  Extra series almost.  They've never done any Physics yet.  They should've supplied the basics -- material covered in most high schools.  And if they wanted to \"get on to some real physics\" maybe do it in the second half of the series, or do another segment.  This just feels like a complete curveball.  Absolutely any other series, I can sit down and watch it beginning to end....no matter how long I've been outta school.  This doesn't allow that.  And most high school teachers aren't teaching any of this either.  At least, not until the very end of the course.  I was so confused by the approach that I actually dug up my old physics binder out of my closet after my first comment to make sure we didn't do it this way.  In a class made for and filled with the top 30 kids in our entire class...?  Sure enough, we didn't touch most of this until about 3/4 of the way through.  And even then, I'm not sure I would've been able to continue if I hadn't been in Calc at the same time.  And remember about half the class had to take Trig instead of Calc that year bc of scheduling...annnd...they struggled.  I know they were put between a rock and a hard place.  But this feels like a big, big miss.  Great for college.  Great for maaaaybe maybe a few advanced high schoolers.  But unless they dramatically turn into way more accessible presentations?  Starting this advanced is only going to serve the AP kids and college kids.  ...and, I still worry, intimidate anyone wanting to take physics in the future.   I know if 15 yo me had seen this?  I feel pretty damn sure I woulda nixed Physics so fast.  Which, is terribly sad bc Physics is so cool.

And the power number is taken down a point.  So, 2x^3 becomes 6x^2 Because (2*3)x^(3-1) <-- the power number multiplies the number in front of the variable, and the power number is taken one down.  Say we have the following equasion: x^2 +5x Then we basically apply the same rules. It may help to read that equasion like this: 1x^(2) +5x^(1) So the result is: 2x +5 Because (1*2)x^(2-1) + (5*1)x^(1-1) An power to 0 or x^0 = 1 so in math/physics we can leave that out. We tend to leave out 1s anyway where possible.  Taking the integral just works the way back. 6x +9 becomes 3x^2 +9x Because the new power law goes up from 1 to 2, the factor number before the variable must be devided by 2, and so it becomes 3 (because taking the derivative of the result should produce the initial starting formula). The constant number 9 can be read as 9 = 9*1 = 9x^0 9/1 * x^(0+1) = 9x^1 = 9x  As for the formulas above, just consider this: If i take the integral of speed, i get the distance.

Suddenly it's not so easy to find it's position from it's acceleration. However, using calculus, we know the velocity would follow the equation -k\u00b7cos(\u03c0\u00b7t)/\u03c0. We take the integral of that to find the position, and we find it follows the equation - k\u00b7sin(\u03c0\u00b7t)/\u03c0\u00b2.
