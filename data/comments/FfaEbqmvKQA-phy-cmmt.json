This is a transfer in energy example. Assuming that what she said was true then since the acceleration at the beginning is the same which is the change in velocity (or 2nd derivative of position) and the mass is the same then the pencil should go through. We all know that the pencil needs to gain velocity to go through but why is that. This is because the transfer of energy is actually what causes the damage not the force. You could use the equation, kinetic energy = (1/2) * mass * velocity squared. This would show you the energy and from there you could see how much energy the pencil had when it hit the wood. This would transfer to the wood and break it. So big energy = big transfer of energy = damage. You would fail physics if you think that the reason a pencil goes through in this example is just because of force. An example where it would work is if you set the pencil on it and used a press to shove it through. But then you would be calculating the acceration of the pencil going through the wood and it would have the added mass the press.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FfaEbqmvKQA", "cid": "UgwNvLPRWonwndY9L_V4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks sir", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FfaEbqmvKQA", "cid": "Ugyf72y0FM57d2lnTrV4AaABAg", "comment": "absolutely  goat", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FfaEbqmvKQA", "cid": "Ugy8LJawqFDB3m7w97p4AaABAg", "comment": "Guys is it really what we got asked in bsc physics?
