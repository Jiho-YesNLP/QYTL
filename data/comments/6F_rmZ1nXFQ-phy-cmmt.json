This just means that voltage at C is less than voltage at A.  Since voltage at C is still less than voltage at B, this means that current flows through R1 from B to C.  The current would be reversed, if there were more voltage at C than at D, but that isn't the case.  To think about this in the hydraulic world, suppose you build a pipeline network with Pump 1 that lifts the water 12 meters above your deck, and then it drops through valve 1 and downspout to point C, which is 0.5 meters below your deck.  You then use pump 2 to lift the water another 8 meters, where it is now 7.5 meters above your deck.  Now the water has to drop down through another valve and downspout to return to its starting point on your deck.   The water is still lifted by the pumps, and falls naturally through the valves and downspouts, so no current is flowing opposite the way it should, through each of the given elements.  The fact that your deck is 0.5 meters above the water's lowest point, is irrelevant to the fact that the water is still flowing with an elevation increase through the pumps, and an elevation drop through the valves and downspouts.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "6F_rmZ1nXFQ", "cid": "UgxYVvERdyyyGl7w1Vx4AaABAg.9fUrF_XIsFe9hE4cEwW2pO", "comment": "Ideally, it is converted into chemical energy, which itself is a form of electric potential energy.
