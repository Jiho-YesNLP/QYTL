I  mean I thought it being one of the oldest , renowned tech and engineering institutes in the world and overall being the best in its kinds will have some high - fi sophisticated lectures !  But now I being an Indian and also being educated in the Indian education system feel the curriculum to be very low on its standards coz almost 95% of all the concepts of all the videos of this playlist is very familiar to me ! Guess what I\u2019m only in 12th grade or high school as you guys say it most of it was taught to us in 11th grade and this portion of rate law is being taught now \ud83d\ude05   I\u2019m not here to belittle anyone or any institute by any chance ! No doubt MIT was the best , is the best and will continue to be the best !\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89  I got to know about these playlists from my friends as they told me they had made notes for an upcoming class test from the MIT lectures and I was like wtf? MIT teaches this !? Isn\u2019t it the best engineering and technology institute ? Why would it teach such a high school level syllabus ? But now that I have realised that (if I\u2019m not mistaken ) india is the only country in the world to have the most fucked up syllabus or high school curriculum that we gotta learn all this when we\u2019re merely 15-16 yrs and excel in this coz obviously ( ASIAN PARENTS ) . Anyways , I got up here ! Watched almost 45 mins of the video and understood every damn thing .   Hats of to the professor \u2764\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 She has the requisite teaching quality that every keen to learn student deserves !  Lots of love from india to the staff members of the institution  Regards \u2764", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgxVNlTSz2SnnpXh1O94AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd0d", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgxJuihl8EHMjjaQ28x4AaABAg", "comment": "This is helpful \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd0d", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgxEpOIp6Do9wYf2mVV4AaABAg", "comment": "Watch me get a 5 on ap chem", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "Ugwnfe7YVOON6P9JY-l4AaABAg", "comment": "Look like first year class", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgyuTSVFUDH5EHf_8St4AaABAg", "comment": "Questions make me feel like I'm better than some of MIT students", "votes": "16", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgzGb8HP3fe5itjbsjN4AaABAg", "comment": "What a teacher \ud83d\udc4c", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgzMvvf4ZsQq8_TAUGt4AaABAg", "comment": "demo guy, please don't say \"yay\" never, ever. thanks.", "votes": "11", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "Ugy-uFynhd1bTX0IQ794AaABAg", "comment": "CHEMICAL KINETICS   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTS5F0UQSVc&t=797s", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgxK6FJVKdECyOqvpu54AaABAg", "comment": "@21:00 Do someone know how to measure the NO concentration with time?", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgwRCoOqVrh46Tr-OUx4AaABAg", "comment": "Good morning mam india district azamgarh i am abhishek nice vidio thans mam its great", "votes": "7", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgzMcmHXQuoDXwJ_GIB4AaABAg", "comment": "Semyaster", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgytGgBfGuHK-55mWDd4AaABAg", "comment": "great explanation", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgxH1dd0xyoP02nIbpt4AaABAg", "comment": "It's great", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgzMvvf4ZsQq8_TAUGt4AaABAg.9DOLoRYRKOZ9L8lGrtPhUL", "comment": "\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgxK6FJVKdECyOqvpu54AaABAg.8uGhZEMJOdK9xJMkS-1gVl", "comment": "Experimentally", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "B7iFcW8USjQ", "cid": "UgwRCoOqVrh46Tr-OUx4AaABAg.8s1mlwIM7p89M-2rUhLn3t", "comment": "Can you please give some more information.
