He showed the 2D case, where the 3x3 matrix with a column of 1s computes the area of a parallelogram (except he cut it in half and called it a triangle).  So the 4x4 case computes the volume of a parallelopiped in 3D. The 5x5 case computes the hyper-volume in 4D, and so on.

Rather, by appending a column of 1s, you get a determinant whose value is the volume.

The area of a special triangle is clearly (ad-bc) for each of those triangles.  det(M) turns out to be the sum of the areas of those 3 special triangles.  The easiest way to find det(M) is to take cofactors of column 3 (the 1's column).  Seen geometrically (as a sum of 3 special triangles), the constant in the third column has to be 1.  The textbook also clearly explains that the area of a special triangle can be calculated as det(M) where the third corner/vector is the origin (0,0).
