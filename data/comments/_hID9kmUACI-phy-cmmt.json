What I really like about all your lectures is that you focus a lot on understanding the concepts, so that we can use them and the equations. You break everything down into the important components and steps correctly. Thank you for these amazing lectures!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_hID9kmUACI", "cid": "UgxWAQzqzziOqtIL9G94AaABAg", "comment": "HES BACK OMG", "votes": "4", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_hID9kmUACI", "cid": "UgxWAQzqzziOqtIL9G94AaABAg.9iZ-eVGMxFM9ia-XqPISN_", "comment": "Sure am!
