The distance traveled will be very much different to each other, but it takes the same amount of time to completely travel in a  complete circle returning to its' starting point. So, you can see that the distance traveled by the innermost point must be traveling very much slower because it cover less distance in the same amount of time. I just don't get it.

The only reason that key stays there is because its attatched to a rope, and it stays at the end of the rope and the roap stays horizontal instead of falling limp is because the tangental forces push it outwards right? So there is a force going outwards, and on a carosel you stay on because you are sitting on somethg and/or holding on to a bar, if you stood on a spinning platform without anything to hold you once you reached a certain speed it would be a real struggle to stay on, because without anything pulling you in you body wants to follow the tangential force.  Similarly satelites have to go a certain speed to stay in orbit, too slow and gravity will pull them inward, but too fast and theyl break orbit.

I get that the net force acting ON object A in uniform circular motion must be towards the center (centripetal); therefore, the acceleration is centripetal. However, whatever object is interacting ON object A must also be experiencing the same interaction BY object A. I think physicist calling a force (like friction or normal) acting outward on an object as \"fictitious\" is misleading and counteracts our struggles in teaching the 3rd Law.   For example, the key spinning in the video is being pulled inward by the string. The net force on the key is inward as a result of the tension. According to 3rd Law, the key is pulling the string outward - centrifugal in direction. At 8:33, the narrator almost mentions this by briefly commenting that \"you'll feel the key pulling harder on your fingers.\" - again, the tension is centrifugal in direction.

According to Newton's first law of motion, a moving body travels along a straight path with constant speed (i.e., has constant velocity) unless it is acted on by an outside force. For circular motion to occur there must be a constant force acting on a body, pushing it toward the center of the circular path. This force is the centripetal (\"center-seeking\") force. For a planet orbiting the sun, the force is gravitational; for an object twirled on a string, the force is mechanical; for an electron orbiting an atom, it is electrical. The magnitude F of the centripetal force is equal to the mass m of the body times its velocity squared v \u20092 divided by the radius r of its path: F = mv 2/ r. According to Newton's third law of motion, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The centripetal force, the action, is balanced by a reaction force, the centrifugal (\"center-fleeing\") force. The two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The centrifugal force does not act on the body in motion; the only force acting on the body in motion is the centripetal force. The centrifugal force acts on the source of the centripetal force to displace it radially from the center of the path. Thus, in twirling a mass on a string, the centripetal force transmitted by the string pulls in on the mass to keep it in its circular path, while the centrifugal force transmitted by the string pulls outward on its point of attachment at the center of the path. The centrifugal force is often mistakenly thought to cause a body to fly out of its circular path when it is released; rather, it is the removal of the centripetal force that allows the body to travel in a straight line as required by Newton's first law. If there were in fact a force acting to force the body out of its circular path, its path when released would not be the straight tangential course that is always observed.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "bpFK2VCRHUs", "cid": "UghWEGfS5OmErHgCoAEC.8DxMqp2izu28qpsIEALVlm", "comment": "\u00a0@franksmith9027\u00a0 Wait.

According to the 3rd Law of motion, if a centripetal force exists then a centrifugal force must always exist. I get that the net force acting ON object A in uniform circular motion must be towards the center (centripetal); therefore, the acceleration is centripetal. However, whatever object is interacting ON object A must also be experiencing the same interaction BY object A. I think physicist calling a force (like friction or normal) acting outward on an object as \"fictitious\" is misleading and counteracts our struggles in teaching the 3rd Law.   For example, the key spinning in the video is being pulled inward by the string. The net force on the key is inward as a result of the tension. According to 3rd Law, the key is pulling the string outward - centrifugal in direction. At 8:33, the narrator almost mentions this by briefly commenting that \"you'll feel the key pulling harder on your fingers.\" - again, the tension is centrifugal in direction.

Consider the velocity at two very close points on the circle.  Because the motion is uniform, they have the same magnitude, they're just in different directions.  What we want is the difference between them, which you get by reversing the direction of one and putting it at the end of the other.  So you have an isosceles triangle, where the difference is the base.  Funny, though - don't the radii form an isosceles triangle?  In fact, they're similar, since both are rotated ninety degrees from the radii.  Since they're similar, then the ratio between the difference in the velocities and the chord between the radii is the same as the ratio between the velocities and the radii.  Now, since we're looking for the time derivative, we're looking for the ratio between that difference and the amount of time that's passed.  Since the velocity is constant, the amount of time that's passed is proportional to the distance along the arc between the two radii.  So to sum up, the ratio we're looking for is: the ratio of the velocity to the radius, multiplied by the ratio of the chord to the arc, multiplied by the ratio of the arc to the time.  For the ratio of the chord to the arc, keep in mind that we're talking about the limit - consider a triangle formed by the chord and two tangents at either end of the chord, meeting in the middle.  As the length of the chord shrinks, the ratio of the chord to the tangents approaches 1.  So since we're talking about the limit, we'll say that the ratio of the chord to the arc is 1.  So now we've got the ratio of the velocity to the radius by the ratio of the arc to the time elapsed, which the ratio of the velocity to the radius by the ratio of the circumference to the period.

There is absolutely nothing at all about the definition of a force that centrifugal force does not fit, every single physicist knows this and every single physicist uses the concept of centrifugal force. There is absolutely nothing, at all, about centrifugal force that does not fit the definition of a force. There is more to the world than inertial reference frames.  Classically we have momentum of an object is mass * velocity of the object. ( p = mv ), this is a fairly useful quantity as it's conserved unless you apply a force to it. A force is simply the amount you change momentum by over a certain time period, we say force is defined as: F = dp/dt. Considering an object with a constant mass, there's no change in mass over time so we can just rewrite the equation F = m(dv/dt).  Now velocity is just how the position of an object changes over time, so we rewrite v = dr/dt, giving us F = m (d^2/dt^2)r.  Now in a circular rotating system, the position x of an object that is constant in a non-rotating frame, is clearly not constant, it changes over time, in a direction that is perpendicular to both the 'upwards' direction and the direction out of the disc, which we denote \u03a9 x r, so dr/dt = dr'/dt + \u03a9 x r , where dr'/dt is the speed we see it moving in from a frame that isn't rotating.   F = m d/dt ( dr'/dt + \u03a9 x r ) F = m [ (d^2/dt^2)r' + (d/dt)(\u03a9 x r)]  F = m [ (d^2/dt^2)r' + \u03a9 x (dr'/dt)  + (d\u03a9/dt) x r + \u03a9x\u03a9 + \u03a9x(dr'/dt+\u03a9xr) F = m[ (d^2/dt^2)r' + \u03a9 x (dr'/dt)+ (d\u03a9/dt) x r + \u03a9 x (dr'/dt) +\u03a9 x (\u03a9 x r)  ] F = m[ (d^2/dt^2)r' + 2\u03a9 x (dr'/dt)+ (d\u03a9/dt) x r +\u03a9 x (\u03a9 x r)  ]   Ergo, m [\u03a9 x (\u03a9 x r)] which is directed radially outwards, entirely fits the definition of a force and exists in a rotating frame.", "votes": "0", "replies": "7", "reply": false}, {"vid": "bpFK2VCRHUs", "cid": "Ugis9AlxDi-o9HgCoAEC", "comment": "What's the point in having a video series on physics where you start on calculus and then never use it at any point where it's needed?

As the velocity can only point into a straight direction there needs to be a force accelerating it inwards all the time to keep it onto the path. This is the centripetal force (Mass of the body x centripetal acceleration).  Now if you are the object you feel the (force of) inertia acting upon you, which always points exactly 180degrees in the other direction of the sum of accelerating forces acting upon you.  So as you can see it depends on what you're looking at.  Maybe it becomes a bit more clear this way, why people say the centrifugal force isn't real (there's another word for it, she's mentioning it in the video, but i'm no native speaker,can't remember it :D): The centrifugal force you feel, if you're inside the system wouldn't be there if there was no centripetal force.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "bpFK2VCRHUs", "cid": "UgjFPcXV3znybHgCoAEC.8DnEPLEKn2D8Dn_-TbLAHM", "comment": "It was a joke about how they told us a million times.
