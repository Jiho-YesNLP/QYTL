The GCD is the largest number that divides both the numerator and the denominator without leaving a remainder. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:  For example, if you have the fraction 35/100 \u200b, 35 is the numerator and 100 is the denominator.  List the factors of both the numerator and the denominator : Factors of 35: 1, 5, 7, 35 Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 The common factors are: 1, 5 The greatest common factor is 5.  Divide both 35 and 100 by 5. So, 35/100\u200b simplifies to 7/20\u200b.  If the numerator is a prime number and it doesn't divide the denominator, the fraction is already in its simplest form.  so you know that you cannot do more simple than that because 7 is a prime number, so that's how you manage to get the same number to divide with. I hope that's clear, do not hesitate if you have more question. i'm also learning maths.\ud83d\ude03", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "Ugykk8F95yPuT1yMnbF4AaABAg.A3ttpIr8UMeA53hjzjURcY", "comment": "\u00a0@supercoolninja\u00a0 Thanks mate =)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgxpE3XkuMUIza9GRQt4AaABAg.A3hVZdLfLKeA3hs6n4QldG", "comment": "Same", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgxpE3XkuMUIza9GRQt4AaABAg.A3hVZdLfLKeA48hpiUH-58", "comment": "I have a final tommorow", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgwyY2NBS8k2G9twOIN4AaABAg.A2RomtwbIkhA2pUEN4MO7k", "comment": "Haha same\ud83d\ude05", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgwEPae3l14W3ohoWU14AaABAg.A1Y8kK9AIluA1_UOyKuNYi", "comment": "U always multiple by 10", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgwEPae3l14W3ohoWU14AaABAg.A1Y8kK9AIluA25SQrf_s80", "comment": "it's called gcf", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgwBUHHpW5aFcTBilRV4AaABAg", "comment": "Maths is hard but with you it is simple \ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgzJh9XZtVo2wzTcAtp4AaABAg", "comment": "I am watching it for my unit 2 test\ud83d\ude02i will get zero", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgzX7J_t1SlMXjxTIeB4AaABAg", "comment": "Who's teacher sent it from Google classroom \ud83d\ude02", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "Ugw0NMLsxWtiEtOm73V4AaABAg", "comment": "does anyone have a test tomorrow and using this as lasts minute studying", "votes": "4", "replies": "4", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgyUtk1JIctvZ4qsId54AaABAg", "comment": "In comprehension 4/5 will be  0.08 or what", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-Xt4UDk7Kzw", "cid": "UgzQHHJgZEts7zEtItR4AaABAg", "comment": "Wait...

For example, to convert 4.56 to a fraction, we should observe that there are 2 digits on the right side of the decimal point. Then, we can remove the decimal point from 4.56 to get 456, and then divide 456 by 1 followed by 2 zeroes (that is, by 100). Then we simplify the fraction 456/100 to get 114/25, by dividing the numerator and the denominator of the fraction each by 4.  To convert a percentage to a fraction, if the percentage is a whole number, you can simply place that whole number over 100 in a fraction and simplify the fraction.

For example, imagine a pizza cut into 4 slices, and imagine that only 1 slice of 4 has mushrooms on it. That is, 1/4 slices has mushroom. Then, imagine cutting every slice into 2 slices. Now, the whole pizza has 8 slices, so we have multiplied the total number of slices of pizza by 2, and the slice with mushrooms has also been cut into two slices, so the number of slices with mushrooms has been multiplied by 2. Now, we have 2/8 slices with mushroom on. But, since we have not added or taken away any mushroom from the pizza, these fractions, 1/4 and 2/8, must be equivalent. This is because both the numerator and denominator have been multiplied by 2. In Dave's example, he multiplies the numerator and denominator of 21/50 by 2 because he wants an equivalent fraction whose denominator is 100, so that he can compare its size to the fraction 45/100. In the cases of 11/16 and 5/8, there is no reason to multiply the numerator and denominator by any other number.

Then, we can remove the decimal point from 4.56 to get 456, and then divide 456 by 1 followed by 2 zeroes (that is, by 100).

The one dave uses in this case is that a whole number can be divided by 10 if and only if it has 0 in the ones digit (or the unit place). For example, 30, 100, and 2570 can all be divided by 10 because they have a 0 in the ones digit (these divisions return 30/10 = 3, 100/10 = 10, 2570/10 = 257), but 6, 41, and 832 cannot be divided by 10. Additionally, you can get the answer to these divisions by simply removing the 0 in the ones digit and shifting all of the other digits to the right. In the example, Dave does this on the numerator and the denominator of the fraction to simplify it. Here are some similar tricks that you might find helpful!  - A whole number can be divided by 2 if and only if it has an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) in its ones digit (that is, a whole number can be divided by 2 if and only if it is an even number).  - A whole number can be divided by 5 if and only if it has a 0 or a 5 in its ones digit.

To adults, who 'learned' mathematics many years ago, these terms are synonymous.    To a child, who is currently learning mathematics, using the term 'reduce' can cause confusion because it implies a change in value.  I was looking for a video that I could share with my students, and the fact that this video used outdated/imprecise language meant that I immediately ruled it out for potential classroom use.  If you'd like to learn more about why current mathematics educators use simplify, here is a short blog post I found: https://greatminds.org/math/blog/eureka/post/precise-fraction-language  Additionally, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has published a number of useful articles over the years about language that math teachers should not use because it causes conceptual errors in our students. Kids can take us quite literally at times, and if we want to build up the correct conceptual understanding, then we need to use precise language.
