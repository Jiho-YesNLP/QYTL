How does current branch in a network of resistors? How does it \"know\" how much should flow in each branch? While some detail is given in science and engineering courses about conductors, insulators and semiconductors, resistance is described in\u00a0several ways. Examples include i.\u00a0The restriction to the flow of electrons. ii. The difficulty in moving electrical current through a conductor to which voltage is applied. iii. a circuit element which dissipates energy in the form of heat . More appropriate description for a resistor would be\u00a0the\u00a0property\u00a0of a conductor which determines the current produced by a given difference of potential. This makes us remember that a resistor is a conductor first. And, there is reason to say that superconductive wires dont obey ohm's law. So all conductors are resistive, though not superconductors. Resistors are used in circuits to regulate the strengths of currents either by\u00a0reducing the diameter of conductors or introducing more obstacles or lattice imperfections\u00a0to reduce the strength of current. The current branches in a parallel network by an elaborate rearrangement of surface charge. Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science and not two, that of electricity and magnetism.  It will be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level\u00a0 as in the following two videos:  i. https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo and  ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo  The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss details about resistance, how current branches in a parallel circuit and ohm's law.  How does current know how to split in parallel branches? To answer this question one must know the role of surface charges in establishing a current and potential difference in a circuit.  Supposing there is  a simple series circuit comprising a battery, wires and a resistor R1 and there is a dead-end branch with a resistor R2 across R1. When the circuit is made then initially electrons flow into both branches, but the surface of the dead-end branch becomes charged so negatively that no more electrons can enter. This prevents current flowing into the dead-end branch. Current of appropriate strength will flow in the R2 branch when the branch is connected across R1. It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the rearrangement of surface charges which allows current through the branch.  The last frame References in video #1  lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss surface charges and explains their rearrangement with the help of sequential diagrams in parallel circuits.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dEuBykX5_B4", "cid": "Ugxku-hTHnYCPwtZKKF4AaABAg", "comment": "love you bro", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "dEuBykX5_B4", "cid": "Ugy962pTiE8mlb_f8RF4AaABAg", "comment": "Your videos have gotten me through so many hurdles!

So taking this and setting up a formula for total Current I(T) we get: I(T) = I(1) + I(2)  And since I=V/R, Total Current in parallel circuit is equivalent to the total Volts, V in circuit divided by the equivalent Resistance R(EQ). Our equation now becomes:  V/R(EQ) = V/R1 + V/R2  Remember that Volts are same accross each circuit in parallel so dividing the whole equation by V yields:  1/R(EQ) = 1/R1 + 1/R2  Now to solve for R(EQ) we just take the inverse if both sides which yields  R(EQ) = 1/(1/R1 + 1/R2)  And that\u2019s why you have to take the inverse of the sum of the inverted resistances in a parallel circuit.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dEuBykX5_B4", "cid": "UgxM5EYW1CJS-Yi4GpB4AaABAg.8vw5g1RvlyJ9BEzIBhVfnB", "comment": "What's wrong?
