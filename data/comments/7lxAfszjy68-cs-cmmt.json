I am thinking it might be possible if we at least assume the future can be predicted from the recent past.  What comes to mind is that a recurrent random event, such as hitting a memory page or database record, can be modeled as a Poisson distribution. Hence, given its average occurrence over previous time intervals {t_0, t_1, t_2, .... t_n}, we can calculate the probability of it occurring x times over the next interval t_n+1. Then prioritize the blocks (or records) with the highest probability. The one with the lowest probability will be eligible for eviction first.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7lxAfszjy68", "cid": "UgwXKmPUnWev8LS1E-d4AaABAg", "comment": "are you uploding more videos on this playlist??", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7lxAfszjy68", "cid": "UgxJroulCKeqaOfvx_p4AaABAg", "comment": "I want to know who unliked this video and for what reason?
