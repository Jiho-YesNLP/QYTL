It's not D because gravity isn't perpendicular to a downward hill, it is always downwards. Surface force is always perpendicular to the surface and since the surface is going down and to the right, surface force is up and to the right. Which means we need a friction force that moves up and to the left. The addition of both surface force and friction force should equal the force of gravity in the positive direction or upwards. Which means C is the only answer.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
