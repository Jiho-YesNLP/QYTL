Typically, in CV context, the input is an image. And the image is just a bunch of pixels. So, roughly speaking, your pixels are your features. So it does not make sense to throw away some pixels. In case of cropping - it is preprocessing technique - not one of features. But if, for example, your input is not a raw image but a bunch of \"extracted features\" like what is the average \"green\" value across all pixels, then, yes, such features you can throw away. But those are very rare cases.
