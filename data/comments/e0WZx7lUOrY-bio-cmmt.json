Spinoza understood that all animals are governed, influenced, and are determined by laws. The law of necessity, the law of self-preservation, the law of inertial, and the law of cause and effect.  Lastly, the brain is not the mind. The brain is a physical thing that is the storehouse of information such as memory, and which helps regulate all the systems of the body. The mind is a non-tangible thinking thing. Its nature or essential nature is knowledge comprised of clear and confused ideas.

It also explores the influence of prenatal environment on behavioral traits, genetic inheritance, and epigenetic changes with multi-generational consequences. The script highlights the complexity of genetic and environmental influences on behavior and traits, including the impact of stress and hormonal exposure during fetal development.\r \r Understanding Behavior Genetics and Genetic Influence on Behavior\r Introduction to behavior genetics and evolutionary psychology\r Shift to molecular biology and support for punctuated equilibrium\r Challenges and approaches in behavior genetics\r \r Genetic and Environmental Influences on Identical and Fraternal Twins\r Identical twins share more genes and environment, while fraternal twins share less genes and environment.\r Behavioral traits in twins can be attributed to genetic influences and shared environment.\r Differences in genetic and environmental influences can affect traits and behaviors in twins.\r \r Gender Differences in Math Skills and Genetic Influence\r Study showed significant difference in average IQ between girls and boys, with boys having higher IQ.\r Boys also scored higher on math SATs, with a 13 to 1 ratio of boys to girls in highest math achievement.\r Adoption studies and genetic influence on schizophrenia were explored by Seymour Ketty at Harvard.\r \r Genetic and Environmental Factors in Schizophrenia\r Adopted individuals more likely to share schizophrenia trait with biological parent than adoptive parent.\r Study in Denmark showed a 9% incidence of schizophrenia in individuals with biological legacy of schizophrenia.\r Adoptive studies on heritability of various traits showed strong genetic component.\r \r Comparison of Genetic and Prenatal Effects in Behavior Genetics\r Prenatal effects can be measured by the percentage of shared traits with biological parents.\r Paternity uncertainty and non-random adoption placements complicate genetic studies.\r Identical twins separated at birth provide a powerful approach for behavior genetics studies.\r Comparison of monozygotic and dizygotic twins helps control for non-random adoption placements.\r \r Influence of Prenatal Environment on Behavioral Traits\r Behavioral traits can occur in the absence of learning or environmental experience.\r Examples of universal motoric patterns shared among all humans, regardless of prenatal environment.\r Prenatal environment, including hormonal exposure and maternal age, can influence later behavioral traits.\r \r Impact of Prenatal Stress and Nutrition on Brain Development and Metabolism\r Prenatal stress leads to smaller brain and thinner cortex in rats, affecting learning abilities and anxiety levels.\r Stress during pregnancy can result in smaller brain region that regulates stress response, leading to elevated glucocorticoid levels.\r Fetal exposure to starvation during Dutch hunger winter leads to metabolic programming, increasing risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in adulthood.\r \r The Impact of Prenatal Programming on Adult Health\r Prenatal programming occurs in the second to third trimester of fetal development.\r Exposure to stress hormones during fetal life can lead to increased likelihood of anxiety disorders as an adult.\r Prenatal exposure to estrogen derived from phytoestrogens may lead to a small but consistent increased risk of estrogen-dependent breast cancer later in life.\r Fetuses can learn and remember sensory experiences from the prenatal environment, impacting their preferences after birth.\r \r Genetic Inheritance and Prenatal Effects\r Prenatal environment influences anxiety levels, not genetic traits.\r Mitochondrial DNA is exclusively inherited from the mother, impacting genetic inheritance.\r Transcription factors in the cytoplasm of eggs come from the mother, affecting gene expression.\r \r Inheritance of Traits and Behavior: The Influence of Transcription Factors

Genes code for proteins essential for cellular function.  Genes contain the code for proteins, which are crucial for the structure and function of cells. The sequence of DNA determines the shape and function of proteins, which can have significant effects on bodily processes. Enzymes, a type of protein, are responsible for accelerating reactions and are crucial for many biological processes. The flow of information in life is from DNA to RNA to protein, but this notion is challenged by viruses and retroviruses that can convert RNA information back into DNA.  2. Various genetic mutations can have significant consequences.  Genetic mutations can occur due to various reasons and can have varying consequences, ranging from neutral to disastrous. Point mutations, insertion mutations, and deletion mutations are the three types of mutations. Point mutations occur when one nucleotide is accidentally changed into another, and can result in a neutral mutation or a different amino acid being coded for, depending on which letter is flipped and its location within the triplet. Insertions and deletions tend to have bigger consequences than point mutations. PKU is a common genetic disorder caused by a single-spot point mutation that knocks out an enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine into a safer form, leading to the buildup of phenylalanine and destruction of the nervous system.  3. Genetic mutations impact gender, anxiety, and cultural adaptation.  Genetic mutations impact gender and anxiety, such as conditions like testicular feminization syndrome and benzodiazepine use to treat anxiety. Tiny changes in single base pairs can lead to dramatic diseases and individual variability, and molecular biology intersects with cultural adaptation.  4. Punctuated equilibrium vs gradualism in evolutionary biology.  There is a debate in evolutionary biology between gradualists and punctuated equilibrium supporters, mainly focusing on the speed of evolution and the lack of molecular mechanisms supporting punctuated equilibrium theory. The majority of fossil pedigrees show patterns of punctuated equilibrium (rapid evolutionary change followed by long stasis). However, modern molecular biology provides evidence for such mechanisms, resolving the controversy surrounding punctuated equilibrium.  5. Genetic differences and similarities between humans and chimpanzees.  Humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genes, but have differences in genes coding for specific physical features. Small genetic changes can have a significant impact on evolution over time, tracing evolutionary history, and studying genes such as Fox P2, which is linked to language and communication disorders. The Fox P2 gene has undergone positive selection over the last quarter-million years, resulting in significant changes in its amino acid sequence.  6. Modular gene construction, gene expression, and introns/exons.  Genes consist of separate coding domains called exons, with in-between sections called introns. Splicing enzymes remove introns from RNA and connect exons to form a continuous stretch of DNA, enabling gene expression. This modular structure allows for the creation of different proteins through splicing, generating various protein combinations. Long stretches of non-coding DNA between genes, initially called 'junk DNA', have been found to play important regulatory roles in gene expression. Promoter and repressor sequences code for switches rather than coding for proteins. They bind molecules that interact with the DNA, turning gene transcription on or off, and, consequently, protein generation. Shared promoters and outside regulators activate entire genetic networks, producing multiple proteins with functional similarities.  7. Gene expression regulation and influence of environment.  The environment, both inside and outside the cell, can regulate genetic effects and influence gene expression. Hormones, chemical messengers, and external stimuli can activate transcription factors and regulate protein production. Furthermore, chromatin modeling, methylation, and epigenetics affect gene accessibility and transcription factors. Genes are regulated at multiple levels, and mutations in splicing enzymes, transcription factors, and promoters can significantly impact evolution.

Genetic and environmental factors both play a role in influencing behavior, and can have long-lasting effects on physical and mental development, even across generations.  1. 00:00 \ud83e\uddec Genes and environment both contribute to behavior, and can be studied by comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins, as well as gender differences. \t1.1 Behavior genetics is a field that can provide insight into the heritable components of behavior, but is also subject to criticism. \t1.2 Behavior genetics looks for patterns of shared traits among individuals with differing degrees of shared genes to infer genetic influences. \t1.3 By controlling for environment, we can examine relatives who share the same environment but differ in the amount of genes they share, to infer something about genetics. \t1.4 Behavioral traits shared to a greater extent in monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins can be attributed to their greater genetic similarity and/or environmental similarity. \t1.5 Monozygotic twins that split during the first five days after conception have their own placenta, while those that split between days five and 10 share one placenta, resulting in more similar IQs than bichorionic twins. \t1.6 Genes and environment both play a role in producing gender differences, even when environment is the same.  2. 15:11 \ud83e\udde0 Adoption studies have found that having a biological parent with schizophrenia and being raised in an adoptive household with a schizophrenic parent increases the risk of a schizophrenia diagnosis by up to 17%. \t2.1 Boys have higher average math scores than girls, with a 13:1 ratio at the highest IQ range. \t2.2 A study published in Science found a 13:1 ratio of boys to girls in the highest math achievement, suggesting biological differences, but this was later disproven due to differences in educational environments. \t2.3 Adoption studies compare shared traits between biological and adoptive parents to study the genetics of behavior. \t2.4 Kety conducted a large study in Denmark to investigate the genetic component of schizophrenia in adopted individuals. \t2.5 Having a biological parent with schizophrenia and being raised in an adoptive household with a schizophrenic parent increases the risk of a schizophrenia diagnosis by up to 17%. \t2.6 The difference between 1 and 9 is about 10%.  3. 30:23 \ud83e\uddec Comparing identical twins separated at birth can reveal the extent to which genetic factors influence traits such as IQ, introversion/extroversion, and aggression. \t3.1 Kety's landmark study showed definitive evidence of a heritable basis to psychiatric disorders, leading to adoptive studies on heritability of various traits such as IQ, criminal behavior, and alcoholism. \t3.2 Prenatal environment has long-term effects, and paternity uncertainty can complicate genetic studies attributing traits to biological parents. \t3.3 Adoption is non-random, and identical twins separated at birth provide the best possible circumstance for behavior genetic studies. \t3.4 Identical twins separated at birth provide a powerful approach to study the effects of environment on behavior, as seen in the bizarre stories of Tom Bouchard's 40 pairs of re-united twins. \t3.5 Twin studies have found that IQ, introversion/extroversion, and aggression are all about 50% heritable. \t3.6 Comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins separated at birth can control for non-random placement in adoptive homes and reveal the extent to which identical genes influence traits.  4. 42:33 \ud83e\udd31 Prenatal environment can have long-lasting effects on physical and mental development, even influencing future generations. \t4.1 All babies, regardless of sight, share the same motor pattern of smiling socially around the same age. \t4.2 Environment does not begin at birth and prenatal environmental effects can be enormously influential. \t4.3 The assumption that environment begins at birth has been challenged by recent research on prenatal environment and its effects on the fetus. \t4.4 The age at which you reach puberty is affected by the age of the mother when she gave birth and the number of siblings in the womb, due to differing estrogen levels. \t4.5 Prenatal stress can lead to a smaller brain, decreased learning abilities, increased anxiety, and difficulty recovering from stress as an adult. \t4.6 Prenatal environment can cause non-genetic inheritance of traits, such as elevated glucocorticoid levels and a thinner cortex, which can be passed down for up to five generations.  5. 54:22 \ud83e\udd30 Fetuses exposed to famine during the third trimester of pregnancy develop a thrifty phenotype, leading to a 19-fold increased risk of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in adults, as well as anxiety disorders in their grandchildren. \t5.1 During the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944, 40,000 people starved to death due to food being diverted to Germany by the Nazis. \t5.2 Fetuses exposed to famine during the third trimester of pregnancy develop a thrifty phenotype, which is a metabolic programming to store nutrients efficiently. \t5.3 Individuals exposed to famine in the second to third trimester of fetal development have a 19-fold increased risk of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome as adults. \t5.4 The Dutch Hunger Winter study showed a 19-fold increase in anxiety disorders in adults due to elevated stress hormones during fetal life. \t5.5 The grandchildren of Dutch Hunger Winter fetuses are born with a milder version of the Dutch Hunger Winter phenomenon due to their thrifty metabolism. \t5.6 Epigenetic changes in genes related to insulin have been identified in Dutch Hunger Winter babies.  6. 01:02:27 \ud83e\udd30 Prenatal exposure to hormones, nutrition, and sensory stimulation can have multigenerational effects on traits. \t6.1 Prenatal exposure to estrogen and phytoestrogens can increase the risk of estrogen-dependent breast cancer, and prenatal learning can be demonstrated in rats. \t6.2 Fetuses can learn to recognize and prefer flavors they were exposed to in the womb, as well as hearing their mother's voice. \t6.3 Newborns prefer hearing The Cat in the Hat, as measured by increased sucking motions, compared to a random collection of sentences, but the same effect does not occur when fathers read it aloud to the mother's belly. \t6.4 Geneticists have found that prenatal effects of hormones, nutrition, and sensory stimulation can have multigenerational effects, and a study by Darlene Francis showed the power of these effects through an adoption study of rats bred for different levels of anxiety. \t6.5 Early experience can influence the nature of a pregnancy, resulting in different anxiety levels in the fetus. \t6.6 Cross-fostering studies suggest that prenatal environment has an effect on traits, and this is complicated by the possibility of misattributed paternity.  7. 01:10:31 \ud83d\udc23 Newborn chicks have a heritable tendency to peck at their feet, which can lead to changes in physical traits, personality, and even evolutionary legacies. \t7.1 Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, have their own DNA which is related to their function, supporting the hypothesis that they were once independent organisms. \t7.2 At fertilization, the mother contributes a disproportionate share of DNA, including mitochondrial DNA and transcription factors, which can be used to trace evolutionary legacies. \t7.3 Environmental toxins can disrupt the activity of transcription factors, resulting in heritable non-expression of a gene, creating a Lamarckian trait. \t7.4 Environmental perturbations can cause Lamarckian inheritance of traits, ranging from subtle to substantial, that are not related to the amount of genes or DNA inherited from each parent. \t7.5 Physical traits, such as height, that are heritable from parent to offspring can cause people to be treated differently, leading to changes in personality. \t7.6 Newborn chicks have a heritable tendency to peck at their feet, which indirectly leads to their ability to find and eat grubs.  8. 01:26:06 \ud83e\udde0 Early experiences can cause lifelong changes in the brain, with multigenerational consequences. \t8.1 Political party affiliation is 70% heritable, and is linked to a personality difference of how people feel about ambiguity, with conservatives being more ambiguity-averse. \t8.2 Genetic differences in neurobiology of pain sensitivity can lead to heritability of aggression. \t8.3 Epigenetic changes can cause lifelong differences in gene expression and multigenerational inheritance of non-genetic traits. \t8.4 Picking up a rat for three minutes and putting it back has positive effects on its brain and health, while taking it away for an hour and a half has negative effects. \t8.5 Variability in rat mothering styles is reflected in the neonatal handling phenomenon, which produces better outcomes in pups and is multigenerational. \t8.6 Early experience can cause lifelong changes in the brain, which can be reversed by later experiences, and can have multigenerational consequences.

Also it\u2019s no secret that between men and women, have different IQ distributions, men tend to have more outliers.

The degree to which my math education was torpedoed by the educational system, and that d*** \"math gene\" study, is a travesty. I was great at math until I skipped 3rd grade, based on my reading and verbal skills, and so missed the multiplication tables. Thrown into the 4th grade and long division, I was very confused, but when I asked questions, I was brushed off and told I was obviously just too stupid to understand, and girls can't do math anyway. I struggled, always behind, through high school (honor student, magna cum laude, National Merit Scholar,) catching up enough to get through Algebra II [a junior-year course for top track students back then] and Trigonometry (with straight A's in Geometry,) and all the while, as my Gifted & Talented educator mother castigated me and my teachers for my unacceptable B's in math, my teachers said it was fine, so few girls can do math, you saw that study, and we have to help the ones getting worse grades. I didn't take any math senior year, and my male guidance counselor (who told me I was clearly not a student who liked challenges and should go to a community college) said I was not smart enough to take physics, so I didn't take that either. So when I tried to major in biology in college, I was great in the biology classes - I was a genetics lab TA - but I was too far behind in math to catch up for college chemistry, and it never occurred to me that individual tutoring could be a thing, because asking for help was shameful and weak and no one would ever help anyway. And that was that. I switched to, and aced, a theater degree mid-junior year, graduated with basic honors, and have been an admin worker and semi-pro musical performer all my life.

Why am I here? What is wrong with the world? And how what is wrong be made right? While we may not say them, it is in the soul of every person to wrestle with these questions.  Allow me to answer these questions first from the perspective of our culture and then from the perspective of the Bible.   Answer from our culture: Who am I? You are an accident. You are a mistake. You are a glorified ape. You are the result of random evolutionary process. That's it. No rhyme. No reason. No purpose. This is the pathetic reality when evolution runs its full course. If the idea is carried to its logical conclusion, human beings have no value. You are ultimately nothing.   Why am I here? You are here to consume and enjoy. That's the only thing that matters. When the famous philanthropist John D. Rockefeller was asked, \"How much money is enough?\" He was as honest as any man has ever been. He responded, \"Just a little bit more.\" Consume and enjoy-thats why you're here.  What is wrong with the world? People are either  insuffciently educated or insuffciently governed. That's  What's wrong with the world. People either don't know enough. Or they're not being watched enough.  How can what's wrong be made right? The solution is more education and more government. Teach people more stuff and give them more information. How do we combat AIDS? Through AIDS awareness. How do we combat racism? Anti hate class. What about the man who beats his wife? Anger management classes. Just give people more information and everything will be fine. The answer provided by our culture leaves us waiting in empty. Let's now take a look at how God's word, the Bible, answers these questions.  Answers from the Bible Who am I? You cannot figure out who you are until you discover who Jesus Christ is. Jesus \"is the image of the invisible God.... By him all things were created... All things were created through him and for him\"( Colossians 1:15 - 16). He is God With Us. God Among Us. The Bible says that I am created by God/In His Image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). Not the result of random processes. The Bible says that whether I am tall and beautiful or small and not so handsome. Whether my body functions perfectly it or is severely deformed. I am the crowning glory of the creation of God. And as a result I have inheritance of dignity, worth and value.  Why am I here? All things were created through him and for him.... That in everything he might be preeminent\" (colossians 1:16b, 18). The ultimate purpose of all things is to bring glory and honor to Jesus Christ. That's why I exist. That is why you exist. And because of this contrary to the views of our culture. The reason for my existence goes far beyond comprehension and enjoyment.  What is wrong with the world? I am. You are, despite the fact that we are the crowning glory of the creation of God. Created to live and bring glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ. We are instead hostile and disobedient towards the one by whom and for whom we were created. All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned / everyone to his own way(Isaiah 53:6). The Bible calls this disobedience sin and it says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) in short, sin is what's wrong with the world.  How can what's wrong be made right? What is wrong can only be made right by the substitutionary, atoning death of Christ. \"He [Jesus] has now reconciled[you] in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him\" (Colossians 1:22). There is no other means by which we can be made right with God. There is salvation in no one else. For there is no other name under Heaven given among us men by what we must be saved\"(Acts 4:12). The Bible says. For our sake[God] made [Jesus] to be sin who knew no sin. So that in him we might become the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21). There was nothing else that could have been done that would have allowed God to be righteousness and also the one who makes us right. In the mercy of God the father he punishes his son in our place in order to satisfy his righteous wrath against sin. Our only hope is to believe in Jesus Christ who was crucified for us and rose again (1 Corinthians 1:23 15:3-4). The simplest Lamb of God gave his life to paint a dead that he did not owe on behalf of sinners who cannot pay him back!  The ultimate answer: If those two sets of answers from our culture and from the Bible- if placed side-by-side something very interesting happens. With the answer from our culture, you are left worthless, empty and hopeless. You are on your own to pursue satisfaction... And you'll never find it. But the Bible says you are precious. You have purpose. You were purchased. The only way what is wrong in your life can be made right is for you to believe what the Bible says. Believe that Jesus took the punishment for your sins by dying on the cross as a substitute for you and that he rose from the dead three days later. Showing that God had accepted his death on the cross as a payment for sin / debt that you owe to God. If you believe this to be true, repent (completely turn from) your sinful pattern of life. And place your faith completely in Jesus Christ. God promised if you confessed with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God rose from the dead. You will be saved (Romans 10:9).  The answer to life's ultimate question is Christ. Those who walk aimlessly through what this life offers will never be satisfied with the answers our culture gives us. Christ is the only one who will ever satisfy.

I postulate that the nutrient deficiency phases in the USA were not only rooted in actual famines and world war situations but also in soil depletion caused by sewage facilities pumping away the dung which Should be composted and added back into the food plant meadows. Dr. Rudolf Steiner warned us about this grave danger of soil depletion around 1910. This problem is worst in the USA, second worst in Western Europe and third worst in Eastern Europe where there are still farmers who do composting as they did 200 years ago but that is also in decline. Industries were not willing to listen to Dr. Rudolf Steiner and other scientists who warned about soil depletion and other negative developments in rural and urban environments because the industries each clung to their profit maximization and market perpetuation. They cared more about their short term profit than the long term effects of soil depletion and other negative developments. Now we are dealing with the results of soil depletion just to mention this one example which caused and causes all kinds of health problems in the population including immune deficiencies. This is a very serious subject and should be studied in depth and we need activists who demand a complete reform of the way sewage is managed.

Do not throw stones at heretic, do not discriminate against different races, do not beat women, do not hate Jews - all of these were crimes. And were overcame by people whose actions were against existed laws, through 'illegal activity'. Defending your own child against a murderer is a crime in many modern countries. You should watch silently how your child is being killed and do nothing. But if a parent would defend their child by attacking the murderer, it would be a crime. On the other hand citizens of aggressive counties denying to kill people who did nothing bad for them are criminals too. Those who didn't want to go to Vietnam, Germans who didn't want to go kill Russians, Russians who don't approve what Russia is doing in Ukraine - they all are criminals by the law. So, for the science sake, what is the 'criminal behavior' they studied? It does even sound like an old 19-century idea about 'black's behavior', or 'inherited behavior of poor', or even like 20-century 'Jewish behavior'. Laws - just random imaginary ideas of human, who know nothing about things they want to regulate. Most laws are made by people who by themselves never needed what they want to prohibit (e.g. most prohibition of painkillers were made by people who never felt strong long-lasting pain, of course they can't believe humans can feel pain so great they want to kill themselves - Tchaikovsky had such severe migraines he tried to kill himself a couple of times during them). Therefore there are no 'criminal behavior', but just behavior, randomly approved or disapproved by those with the power, sitting on comfortable sofas and fantasizing about unrealistic imaginary worlds with 'correct' and 'incorrect' ways to live.

Tiny changes early on in our existence, can potentially have dramatic influences later in life.  So in the 'nature and nuture', 'nurture' even being a part of 'nature', 'nature' is obviously key in so far as an entity of some sort (made up of nature) being in an environment of some sort (also made up of nature).  And so far for me at this time, what is called 'gravity' is a part of the currently recognized 'em' photon, and the 'gem' photon (which is probably just a singular force with 3 different modalities), is the basic energy unit of  this universe that makes up everything in existence in this universe.  'Us' as 'nature' being in an 'environment' made up of 'nature', or basically 'gem' photons interacting with other 'gem' photons.  Everything in existence is energy and energy frequencies interacting with other energy and energy frequencies.  And as 'space' is energy itself, energy being the 'gem' photon, and 'time' is the flow of energy, 'we' are basically space and time interacting with our self.  And this 'space time' has a consciousness, at least as evidenced by the consciousness we are supposedly experiencing.  But now, do only entities with a physical properly functioning brain have 'consciousness', OR does possibly even the 'gem' photon have some sort of consciousness, albeit at possibly the lowest level of consciousness in existence, and later more evolved consciousness' come about due to the energy interactions within nature itself?  And then also, if at least one consciousness does not truly exist in some form throughout all of future eternity, (future eternity being a never ending flow of energy that has yet to flow in that respective flow at that time), then do all things cease to matter one day as one day there wouldn't be a conscious entity left to care?  'What exactly matters throughout all of future eternity and to whom does it exactly and eternally matter to?  (If even to any conscious entity at all).

Also when I remember school and math at those ages everyone had the same exercises and needed to complete the same amount of math so everyone got the same amount of practice.

I have come to believe he is not dogmatic but is more so rather agreeable in his temperament. My reasoning for this conclusion is I think displayed in how he often talks very praisingly of other scientists and sometimes references his part in certain studies with other  scientists as not worth mentioning. He does, however, engage in criticism of other scientists as well as banter. I do think he has a strong preference for an ethological approach, which might make it seem like he's possessed by the idea. But I do believe after watching his videos that he is highly agreeable, explores topics well, has some conflation of terminology at times, but I don't think that makes him a postmodernist. Though, perhaps I did not pick up on all that he said. Do you have any examples of this \"postmodernist\" view? I put postmodernist in quotes because I don't think that what is commonly regarded as postmodernism is an actual representation of what it really is as a philosophical system. At least if your view of postmodernism comes from any popular thinker such as Jordan B. Peterson, Dave Rubin, Ben Shapiro, and the like. The views these individuals attribute to postmodernism  are not the views of philosophers like Foucault or Derrida, who are considered postmodernists. Either way, I'd appreciate hearing from you if there were specific examples.  If he is dogmatic, I would say he is probably idealogically possessed by biological fundamentalism and determinism. I say this because he seems at times to think that biological and environmental (cultural/social/prenatal) forces account for an individual's actions and behaviors to the degree that there is no choice, and thus, no will. I say this because of his denial of free will in several interviews (and perhaps a will isn't really a \"free\" will in that it is not unaffected by environmental or biological factors, but I think that a will does exist, in the sense that a neurotypical person has the ability to make decisions). Humans certainly have a larger degree of freedom than does a cat, a great ape, or any other species. People can know they are unattractive, and decide to get plastic surgery if they want, but if they do get surgery, this action is not a result of trying to alter their genetic makeup as it will not change their genes. Perhaps they were motivated by their perception of themselves, but not all people would choose to alter their appearance, as some are more motivated than others to change certain aspects of themselves.  It's too soon for people to say that there is no will, as there is good evidence that there is some sort of volitional and autonomous aspect to human nature.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "e0WZx7lUOrY", "cid": "UgzXgavUfDEcl7wQtXB4AaABAg.8mlsn4mxjC18qQKNnyVVUI", "comment": "Mykah Marks First of all, I\u2019ve never encountered such a well thought response on YouTube, thank you.

These dealt with schizophrenia. He fails to mention adoption studies carried out by Teasdale and Owen, also in Denmark, and later referred to by Bouchard. These were about intelligence. They were studies of adopted-away full-siblings, half-siblings, and unrelated children. All were boys, born between 1938 and 1947. Then they got the draft board records of intelligence tests of these boys when they were young adults (I know these intelligence tests; i was born in 1949 and tried the same tests). The data treatment gave as a result a 0.04 percent influence of environment, and a staggering 0.96 percent heritability of intelligence test results - the highest ever obtained. Why would intelligence be genetically determined to such a vast extent exactly in Denmark? The Danish society at that time was ethnically very uniform. Also, there had been a long period of social upward movement in the parent generation, so that everybody intelligent enough to rise socially, had done so. The intellectual environment was very uniform - very few children went to private schools. We all went to public schools, and the school system was the same everywhere. Nobody was very poor, and schools in relatively poor districts were no different form other schools. There was only one (public) television channel, so everybody saw the same programs in television. We all read the same Donald Duck magazines, etc. etc. The whole intellectual environment was extremely uniform. So how could there be any influence of environment on intelligence? Well, there was no influence, and practically all differences in intelligence were genetic.  This, of course, would not be true in societies with large social differences. For instance, an earlier study (around 1950) of attained level of education in Norway showed a large effect of environment - children from remote parts of the vast country did not have the same chance of a higher education as children from larger cities, even if they were intelligent. So there was not yet the extreme social mobility which later characterized all Scandinavian countries. Now, why should Sapolsky have mentioned this? Because the students get the impression that intelligence is very much about environment, with the implications that differences in intelligence are unjust, some children getting better chances in life than others. But he Danish results indicate that you may eradicate all social injustice, and there will still remain large differences in intelligence, which cannot be removed in any way whatsoever. So even though part of the differences in intelligence in more socially stratified societies, like USA, may be ascribed to some sort of social injustice, the main point is that there will always remain large differences in intelligence which can never be removed, not matter what social engineering you may carry out.", "votes": "32", "replies": "5", "reply": false}, {"vid": "e0WZx7lUOrY", "cid": "UgyN0Jaw9_OtAIsooHV4AaABAg", "comment": "In this lecture, Sapolsky is very biased when it comes to the relative importance of environment vs. genetics.

I care about actual living children having access to good education, nutrition, and healthcare, and clean air and water, all things that are diminished by right-wing economic, environmental and social policies. It's amazing to me how many of the people behind these policies describe themselves as Christian. I don't believe that's what they are. If the Christ they claim to believe in and follow ever really did come back, he'd be as severely critical of them as he was of the Pharisees:    'They taught about God but did not love God \u2013 they did not enter the kingdom of heaven themselves, nor did they let others enter. They preached God but converted people to dead religion, thus making those converts twice as much sons of hell as they themselves were. ... They taught the law but did not practice some of the most important parts of the law \u2013 justice, mercy, faithfulness to God.  ... They professed a high regard for the dead prophets of old, and claimed that they would never have persecuted and murdered prophets, when in fact they were cut from the same cloth as the persecutors and murderers: they too had murderous blood in their veins.'   I can throw roughly the same question back at you: if you care so much about the wellbeing of children, do you support the kind of left-wing policies that are actually aimed at giving them a better life?
