Isn't that just super neat if you would define variable on which you would rotate that cylinder, and you would define buoyant function at every point of this variable, every time it would cancel out perfectly, that's way too clean, there must be some process in the background that I don't get.

I will not be satisfied by some vague notion of sentient water that feels something is in it's way.  I'm looking for deeper process like to explain why is everything falling at the same rate.
