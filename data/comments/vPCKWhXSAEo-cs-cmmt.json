So, 512\u00d71000 ( actually 1024 bits is 1bytes ,1024bytes is 1kB and so on) Here he uses 1000 (some authors says 1000,some says 1024)both doesn't make big difference. Ok so the 512 kbps is now 512000 as bits  From bit we have to find bytes.8bit is 1byte so, 512000\u00f78=64,000 bytes. We found in bits,bytes now we have to find it in KiloBytes (KB) So 1 kiloByte is 1024 bytes as I mentioned earlier. 64,000\u00f71024=62.5 kilobytes ( KB). Bandwidth delay product(capacity) for that link is 62.5 KB.
