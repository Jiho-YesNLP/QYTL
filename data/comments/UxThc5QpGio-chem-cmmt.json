Take the integral of the left side, you get the integral of 1/x dx from initial x to final x, the integral of 1/x is ln(x) so the left integral is ln(x). We are taking a definite integral from the initial concentration to the final concentration of x, so the left side turns out to be ln(xf) - ln(xo). When you take the integral of the right, you get the integral of t from initial t to final t. Since initial t is at time=0, you are just left with t final.
