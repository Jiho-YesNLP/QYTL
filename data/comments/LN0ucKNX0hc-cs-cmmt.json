Electro-mechanic computers grew to room-sized machines, prone to errors and expensive to maintain. \r Mechanical Relays\r The Harvard Mark I was one of the largest electromechanical computers, build in 1944 by IBM. The brains of an electro-mechanical computer where mechanical relays, electronically controlled mechanical switches. These use a control wire containing a coil, producing a magnetic field to control the flow of electricity.    \r Limitations: A downside of mechanical relays is that the mechanical arm can\u2019t move instantly between open and closed states (a good relay could flick 45 times per second). Another limitation was wear and tear; over time things get stuck or fail, and with 35000 relays in the Harvard Mark I, maintenance adds up. Also, the warm and dark environments attracted bugs leading to the first computer bug in 1947, a physical moth found in a relay by Grace Hopper. \r Flemings Valve & Vacuum Tubes\r A faster and more reliable alternative to mechanical relays was needed, and it came in the form of the Flemings Valve. The Thermionic Valve contained two electrodes in an air-tight glass bulb, this was the first vacuum tube. One electrode could be heated, causing it to emit electrons, the other electrode could then attract those electrons to create the flow of our electric faucet.\r Any electronic component that permits the one-way flow of current is called a diode. But containing a control electrode, we could permit the flow of electrons. Because of the lack of moving parts, these \u201cvacuum tubes\u201d could switch thousands of times per second. Although they were a huge improvement on mechanical switches, they weren\u2019t perfect. Vacuum tubes were expensive, and still burned out occasionally. This marked the shift from electro-mechanical computing to electronic computing.\r The first large scale use of vacuum tubes for computing was the Colossus Mk 1, designed by Tommy Flowers in 1943. It was used to decrypt Nazi communications. This may sound familiar because two years earlier Alan Turning design and electro-mechanical machine called the Turing machine to break Nazi enigma codes called \u201cThe Bombe\u201d. The Colossus used 1600 vacuum tubes and is regarded as the first programmable, electronic computer. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) completed in 1946 was the first first truly general-purpose programmable computer. It is estimated it completed more arithmetic than humanity before it\u2019s operation. Unfortunately, it required a lot of maintenance with about 50% down time. Vacuum-tube computing was reaching its limits. \r Transistors To reduce cost and size, and to improve reliability and speed, a new electronic switch was needed. In 1947 the transistor was born. A transistor is just like a relay switch which can be opened and closed by applying electrical power via a control wire. Transistors have two electrodes separated by a  material that can sometimes conduct electricity and other times resist it (semi-conductor) , the most common being silicone. The control wire is attached to the gate electrode. By changing the electrical charge of the gate, the conductivity of the semiconducting material can be changed.\r  \r Even the first transistors could change states 10,000 times per second. Also, because the transistors are made of solid material, a \u201csolid state component\u201d, they were much more reliable and could be made much smaller than vacuum tubes. Today\u2019s computers use transistors that are smaller than 50 nanometres and can switch states millions of times per second. Most of the semiconductor development happened in the San Jose / San Francisco area leading to the area being nicknamed \u201cSilicone Valley\u201d.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LN0ucKNX0hc", "cid": "Ugzpugyim9kRc0Sg_oJ4AaABAg", "comment": "I just keep thinking about what happened after independence 1947 and what before that to remember the timeline of mk1 einac and so on.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LN0ucKNX0hc", "cid": "UgxWHi1tlCmVP9Q1xdF4AaABAg", "comment": "I love what you are doing keep it up", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LN0ucKNX0hc", "cid": "Ugw-Kb1argULnNiFvfp4AaABAg", "comment": "Someone, please explain to me from 2:07 to 2:16 part.

The term \"bug\" does not come from Grace Hopper or her colleagues, even though that is a very well known story.   Inventors and engineers had been talking about bugs for more than a century before the moth in the relay incident. Even Thomas Edison used the word. Here's an extract of a letter he wrote in 1878 to Theodore Puskas, as cited in The Yale Book of Quotations (2006):  'Bugs' -- as such little faults and difficulties are called -- show themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached.  The noun bug (\u201ca defect or fault in a machine, plan, or the like\u201d) was mentioned as early as 1889. In that year the Pall Mall Gazette reported that \u2018Mr. Edison \u2026 had been up the two previous nights discovering a \u2018bug\u2019 in his phonograph\u2013an expression for solving a difficulty, and implying that some imaginary insect has secreted itself inside and is causing all the trouble.\u2019\u2026.  This meaning was common enough by 1934 to be recognized in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary:  \u2018bug, n\u2026. 3. A defect in apparatus or its operation\u2026 Slang, U.S.\u2019\u201d (citation)  So, the \u201cactual bug\u201d notation in the lab notebook probably reflects the amusement of the technician at finding a physical bug, when the word bug was already in use as slang for a problem. It does appear that the term \u201cdebugging\u201d came into use around Hopper\u2019s time period, but there are not any evidence firmly tying it to this particular moth. However, it is more accepted that Hopper et al. invented the word\"debug\" but not the word \"bug\" itself.

I had previously learned about how relays and vacuum tubes worked, but putting them in the context of history really solidified their importance to computing. Bravo! But, the computer scientist and programmer inside of me is screaming at the fact that you labeled what is clearly and ECE course as CS.   Don't feel bad, most people assume CS is building computers or writing code, but there is quite a distinction: CS is mostly theoretical and is built upon MATHEMATICS, NOT ENGINEERING. Hell, the AP Comp Sci exam is done in pencil and paper! All this stuff about relays, vacuums tubes, and transistors is great but if you don't talk about how they relate to logic, well it's not computer science.   That was actually my hope for this episode: \"An Introduction to Logic.\" The history's great and all but, if you don't cover CS principles, well it's not a CS course. For example, when you talked about transistors being a switch, that was a great way to introduce logic gates using multiple transistors. Two in series makes an AND gate and two in parallel make an OR gate. That kind of thing. You could have also had a bit on binary (\"bit\" was a pun!) counting and conversion to octal and hexadecimal (stuff that's tested on the APCSA exam). The direction you're currently moving is towards CPU design (according to previous videos). Again, I find that fascinating to me, but it is still not computer science.  Your primary audience for Crash Course  appears to be high schoolers looking for help on their APs (see: CC World History, CC Physics, etc.). It would really be helpful if you paralleled the AP. An episode on arithmetic, relational, and logical operators and binary counting WOULD BE COMPUTER SCIENCE and I have no doubt you guys could make as interesting and engaging as your other CC series (not to mention relevant to your target audience).  Overall, I really hope you guys either change the name of this or simply go back to the drawing board because passing this off as a CS course is not doing anyone any good.", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LN0ucKNX0hc", "cid": "UghLrgVE16mgUXgCoAEC", "comment": "why is there a oscilloscope in the background?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LN0ucKNX0hc", "cid": "UghaZ-aMtC5grHgCoAEC", "comment": "I joined my school's robotics team this year, and was working a lot with transistors.

While there is some overlap in these two disciples, understanding the science behind how relays and transistors (electrical components) work clearly falls under ECE.

People tend to have huge problems understanding transistors and P-N junctions but it comes down to just a few basic concepts:  1. We can give Silicon a positive or negative charge using a process called doping (adding elements with one more/less electron to a pure Silicon crystal lattice [bonded by Silicon's four valance electrons) 2. These positively/negatively charged areas are called P/N regions, respectively. If we put two of these doped regions together, electrons can only flow one way: from positive to negative (a P-N junction) 3.  Putting two P-N junctions together (in P-N-P or N-P-N configuration) creates a transistor.  This is my main problem with this Crash Course series.

There are multiple paradigms of programming although they can also be called styles of programming.  Three paradigms of programming are procedural, functional, object-oriented, and logic programming.  Procedural programming is procedural, going down a specific path in code, 1 step at a time.  Functional programming uses functions, which can then be used throughout the code by simply stating the name of the function.  Object-Oriented programming consists of a variety of \"objects\" using \"methods\" to communicate and control procedures, this can be compared to functional programming.
