Electro-mechanic computers grew to room-sized machines, prone to errors and expensive to maintain. \r Mechanical Relays:\r The Harvard Mark I was one of the largest electromechanical computers, build in 1944 by IBM. The brains of an electro-mechanical computer where mechanical relays, electronically controlled mechanical switches. These use a control wire containing a coil, producing a magnetic field to control the flow of electricity. Limitations: A downside of mechanical relays is that the mechanical arm can\u2019t move instantly between open and closed states (a good relay could flick 45 times per second). Another limitation was wear and tear; over time things get stuck or fail, and with 35000 relays in the Harvard Mark I, maintenance adds up. Also, the warm and dark environments attracted bugs leading to the first computer bug in 1947, a physical moth found in a relay by Grace Hopper. \r Flemings Valve & Vacuum Tubes:\r A faster and more reliable alternative to mechanical relays was needed, and it came in the form of the Flemings Valve. The Thermionic Valve contained two electrodes in an air-tight glass bulb, this was the first vacuum tube. One electrode could be heated, causing it to emit electrons, the other electrode could then attract those electrons to create the flow of our electric faucet.\r Any electronic component that permits the one-way flow of current is called a diode. But containing a control electrode, we could permit the flow of electrons. Because of the lack of moving parts, these \u201cvacuum tubes\u201d could switch thousands of times per second. Although they were a huge improvement on mechanical switches, they weren\u2019t perfect. Vacuum tubes were expensive, and still burned out occasionally. This marked the shift from electro-mechanical computing to electronic computing. \r The first large scale use of vacuum tubes for computing was the Colossus Mk 1, designed by Tommy Flowers in 1943. It was used to decrypt Nazi communications. This may sound familiar because two years earlier Alan Turning design and electro-mechanical machine called the Turing machine to break Nazi enigma codes called \u201cThe Bombe\u201d. The Colossus used 1600 vacuum tubes and is regarded as the first programmable, electronic computer.\r ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) completed in 1946 was the first first truly general-purpose programmable computer. It is estimated it completed more arithmetic than humanity before it\u2019s operation. Unfortunately, it required a lot of maintenance with about 50% down time. Vacuum-tube computing was reaching its limits.\r  Transistors:\r To reduce cost and size, and to improve reliability and speed, a new electronic switch was needed. In 1947 the transistor was born. A transistor is just like a relay switch which can be opened and closed by applying electrical power via a control wire. Transistors have two electrodes separated by a  material that can sometimes conduct electricity and other times resist it (semi-conductor) , the most common being silicone. The control wire is attached to the gate electrode. By changing the electrical charge of the gate, the conductivity of the semiconducting material can be changed.\r  \r Even the first transistors could change states 10,000 times per second. Also, because the transistors are made of solid material, a \u201csolid state component\u201d, they were much more reliable and could be made much smaller than vacuum tubes. Today\u2019s computers use transistors that are smaller than 50 nanometres and can switch states millions of times per second. Most of the semiconductor development happened in the San Jose / San Francisco area leading to the area being nicknamed \u201cSilicone Valley\u201d.", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gI-qXk7XojA", "cid": "Ugww5Inu7-m4bUArhbF4AaABAg", "comment": "I miss this.

As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:  1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.  2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.  3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an \"off\" state at 0 volts. We wouldn't want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off!

In modern computers however, Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are the ones that are actually used and they are used because there is almost no current flowing.  The reason that FETs are so efficient even translates well to the water metaphore. You waste less water with pressure-based logic  because water only has to move when gates are turned on or off whereas with flow-based logic, anything that is on needs to have water flowing to the ground.

In addition, by applying the same wire to both inputs or a NAND or a NOR, it can act as a not. Combine that with a nifty trick that lets you convert between AND and OR by inverting the inputs and outputs, and it becomes possible to define all of the basic logic gates in terms of just NOR or NAND.
