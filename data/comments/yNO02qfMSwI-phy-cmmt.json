It can actually slash your dorm and/or tuition in half, saving you thousands. Scholarships are nice too if you can go and acquire them. Do an internship every summer, not having at least one seriously diminishes your chances of getting a job when you graduate. Meet people and go to clubs. Try to make time for them as they are not only fun, but are the paths of networking and finding friends/romantic interest before you go out into the professional world where everyone has a fake mask to match society. Be careful, you can do stupid stuff in college as memories but don't get yourself or other people hurt. Try to eat healthy and exercise as you aren't forced to anymore. Especially take care of your teeth. Last but not least, check in with your highschool/childhood friends. College is a stressful time for some and a lot of people go into depression if they're alone.

There are some few degrees that actually have 3 lectures a week, but most of them are on the other side of the spectrum. In addition to the 20 hours of lectures per week in Bioengineering, you have 6 hours of laboratory courses (3x2 hours), each of them with extensive preparation before and evaluation afterwards. If you calculate pure hours per week (neglecting any preparation or work afterwards, including going through notes and such) this study course ends up at 12+8+10+10+10+8=58/2=29 hours per week (12 hours on 2 mondays, 8 hours on 2 tuesdays, ..., 4 hours each saturday).
