Since the Gibbs free energy represents the theoretical maximum work of the cell, it is useful as a basis for calculating the efficiency of an actual voltaic cell.  The fuel-cell community uses this approach but interestingly I cannot find the same information among the battery literature.  Since there's so much focus on lithium ion batteries these days I was curious to see some efficiency figures based on the Gibbs free energy.  I wonder if you have a feel for a typical value.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Hee1xfaQEBM", "cid": "Ugx8DXz7FhbJvRrkcPZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you so much!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Hee1xfaQEBM", "cid": "UgzS8vcdIjTp67iFETZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Good lecture sir", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Hee1xfaQEBM", "cid": "UgxZgfAgH-wx6djFAe14AaABAg", "comment": "The battery example made everything click!
