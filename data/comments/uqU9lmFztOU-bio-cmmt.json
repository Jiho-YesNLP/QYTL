I am not talking about the best way to learn (using book, attending school, etc), but the precise mechanism in the brain that allow to acquire new data and recognize information already recorded.  My formation was as electric engineer, followed by software engineer with real life experience if embedded firmware. I may have tendency to use expressions such as pulse to describe the chemical/electrical wave that is called \"action potential\" by the brain specialists. My comparisons between brain and computers are metaphors that are used in the hope to clarify the explanation. It is not the intent to imply the superiority of any of these tow very different systems.  With the help of language, the information acquired by each individual can be transmitted to the new generation very efficiently. The invention of writing allowed to transmit information across large group, cultures and even thru large gap of generation.  For example of gap between a large number of generation, look at the damage created by the domination of Christianity soon after the fall of the Roman empire. From that time  up to  the renaissance, the Greek philosophy was forbidden. Any information that could threaten the power of religion was vigorously shut down. A curious mind was more likely to be burn as sorcerer than a child molester. This is the dark age, where most people were living in a poor intellectual environment. Since there was only one book to read, the Bible, there was little interest to even learn how to read and write.   During the dark age, the Muslim world was rich with science, math, etc. Look at the words starting by \"al\" in any English dictionary to find scientific subjects that became popular during renaissance. After 1500 years of darkness, Europeans rediscovered to richness of Greek philosophy. From their state of death culturally, the felt like \"born again\", alive, which is the meaning of the french word \"renaissance\".  In the last two decades, Internet web sites, such as Wikipedia and new philosophy such as open source software seems to sparkle a new era with high quality information almost free.  Back to the main subject of this document : Memory  The 2 proposed mechanism are:  1 - connection growing as we learn 2 - synapse reinforcing on already connected neurons  We may find that both are thru, depending on precise location in the brain.  The saying \"Neuron that fire together wire together\" illustrate the net result that must happen physically in the brain for the process of association of information. Brief, two brain areas located millions of cell layers away, should increase significantly their chance of becoming active together if they represent information that has some link with each other.  The type of concept that can be associated together has the be very generic since the brain can perform tasks that were never done by any previous generation. This observation appear to discredit immediately the second mechanism proposed in the introduction. We will explain in more detail these problems and some solutions in this document.  Let's get an example to help clarify what we are talking about.  Example: I am at the beach and I see a few seagull flying around somebody who is holding a plate of french fry. He throws one at a time, as high in the air as he can. One of these bird catch it in mid air most of the time. Sometime, a bird chase another, trying to steal the food before he could swallow it.  The subject discussed here is not an abstract invention, it is not playing with words and creating artificial concepts to make a final exam impossible to pass. The subject is about memory, how it work inside our brain. If anything I propose can be demonstrated to be false, I would get rid of such false ideas. My only goal is to understand how the brain really works.  Memory is the hearth of any thinking system. Understanding memory get us very close to a full understanding of the way humans think and learn.  I recognize however that this text will be meaningless if it is analyzed by an automatic computer software. The neural network used by Google, NSA and others will not have a clue of what is discussed here.  From the example above, I want to focus on the following question:  How the brain can associate a concept from the visual area (seagull) and a concept from the auditive area (bird song). You may say \"seagulls don't really sing\", but I don't judge your weird choice of noise that you call music.  This process is supposed to be bidirectional. That is, a picture of a magnificent bird can remind you it's superb song or it's obnoxious squeaky voice.   And the opposite direction of the association also exist, possibly at the same time. A sound recording of the bird suffice to bring back in your memory the look. Maybe, if, like me (Christian Gingras, from Quebec city but living near San Francisco for the last 16 years and unable to find work for a long time), you can not voluntarily bring any image of anything in your visual system, you still can associate the sound with any picture or real live bird,  I can not start painting something I saw a few years ago. I would not be able to paint something live, just in front of me. I can compare images and describe their content in any level of detail. Note that for sound, things are different. If I did not understand your last phrase, I can recall that short stream of sound, replay it and finally get what you said.  I can replay some fragment of a song that I heard on radio, if it has a distinctive melody. I even succeeded to distinguish one heavy metal song from another, which is as amazing as these 56K modems extracting data from what sound like the white noise from a fast flowing water fall.  For example, each time I see this kind of bird (most of them are that size, that color, etc) I hear that characteristic bird song. After we clarify how the visual system makes statistical processing to conclude that a specific bird belong to that type (call it race, specie, variety, etc). From that point, that single concept that represent the large amount of visual stimuli need  to relate to another brain area which memorize bird song.  The processing of sound from the auditive area is equally complex. The number of operations to convert a stream of raw frequency/harmonic information from the cochlea in the ears, with all the noise always present, to become a unit of information, is as complex as extracting 3d information from the 2d projection on the retina.  Eventually, these two concepts (bird type and bird song) need to get associated. It is impossible to know in advance what we will learn. The association can not exist before we experience it. So, there is a need to physically change the connection to create new association or an alternative way to allow the complex and very large amount of concepts that we accumulate during our entire life.  Red flag:  - growing new synapse takes time (from minutes to hours for short distances, weeks for long distances)  - neuron \"action potential\", is very short duration (less than 1 miili second)  - two neurons that need to create an association would need to travel thru layers of glial cells and neurons/myeline  cells to finally get a physical connection.

(only the dendrite of one noodle is growing toward the other, the other just wait in place for a synapse to form somewhere along its axon)  - The bowl of spaghetti is the size of an Olympic pool.  - The starting location of both noodle is random (anywhere on the surface)  - The depth is also random (X, Y and Z are random)  - The texture of the noodle is the same everywhere. (No bone or other hard structure to hold on ; think of wine plant growing on top of each other on the side of a hill)  - The dendrite of the growing noodle act like the root of a tree. It seek the closest path  in this 3d pool, adjusting the grow rate in all direction, keeping the tip with the highest chemical gradient, destroying the other part that were proven to grow in the wrong direction.  - Like the growing root, the noodle zigzag around harder obstacles, like other neuron, then continue to grow in the direction of highest gradient of chemical, attracted by the other neuron. Presumably, in this model the glial cells would be equivalent to the soft soil which can be pushed as the root is growing  - As it progress and it is approaching the other, the dendrite is not distracted by the same chemical that other pair of neuron emit while they also grow their connections.  Beside the root of plants, do we know any example of living cells which make precise and complex 3d connections? Can we compare this memory process, which is modeled as neuron creating new connections in a 3d jello bowl, to the growing of early cells of the nervous system in an embryo?   Starting from the neural tube, we now understand how some guiding cells migrate in precise locations. The first, closest to the starting point, already on guard at the correct position, start generating a gradient of chemical that attract a cluster of early neuron cells. As the group of neurons arrive at destination, the gene of the guide cell turn off,  the chemical gradient vanish, and another guide cell located further has in it's gene the instruction to turn on the generation of that chemical. The cluster of neurons then continue to grow in that direction.  Like in an orchestra with each musician able to play alone, but also synchronizing to the other by watching the gesture of the maestro, the growing embryo assemble the 3d structure by a combination of operation which sometime depend on signal from distant cells which synchronize the work and guide the shape on a scale much larger than any individual cell.  Another possible way that neuron can make arbitrary connection with any other part of the brain is that all possible physical connection are made at the beginning. The memory would actually be made by destroying specific connection.    Below, I propose 3 mechanisms to the formation of memory which are not based on growing new connections between distant neurons.  Physical change memory This physical removal of the synapse and the rest of the thin row of cells that attach it to the dendrite could happen on the second to minute time scale.  Positive memory Alternatively, instead of destroying the connection, the memory could be enforced by the chemical dynamic in the synapse. Each time a pulse appear at the synapse, it could make other pulse easier by speeding up the reuptake or by introducing other neurotransmitter which would decrease the threshold needed to transmit the next pulse. (note: the word \"pulse\"  is used as shorthand to action potential)  Negative memory Yet, another variation could be that a synapse that got exercised many times become \"tired\" and less likely to transmit in the future. Memory would be acquired when a synapse decrease it chance to transmit another pulse.  This was the second part since youtube could not accept this text in one post.

In astronomy, people invent convenient units such as Parsec and solar radius. I presume we have equivalent units in neurobiology such as \"neurometre\", the mean distance between neurons in a human brain.  It is presumed that creating a new association between a visual object (located a few layer deep in the visual area) and a spoken word (located in the Wernicke or Broca area) would require crossing thousands of \"neurometre\". As the neuron is growing a connection, it could easily get distracted by any other neuron that would happen to also \"request\" an association to be learned.  In other words, assuming we can learn many different association in a given unit of time, then the risk of creating wrong association are high.  However, if the cortex is really divided in columns with relatively small number of neuron interacting at the same time, that appear to simplify this problem.

The answer is that each neuron receive as input the signal from many neurons and it will transmit a signal only if it detect a pulse from a percentage of input within a small time windows. In other words, there is a voting mecanism where a signal continue only if the total number of neuron exceed a threshold.  Contrary to computer, where each bit has a different weight, for the neuron, just the total number of synapse activated is important. So, if a given neuron receive 10 synapse from a given neuron, it's voting power is greater; somewhat like a company with vote rated on number of share.  The integration function of each neuron is equivalent either to \"addition\" or to the logic operator \"OR\" or \"AND\" depending. When the excitation threshold is low, it act like \"OR\" which mean any pulse present on the input trigger an output. A high threshold act as a logic operator \"AND\" where every input has to get a pulse to trigger a pulse on the output.  Depending on chemistry at the synapse, a pulse can be inhibitor. This allow to create the equivalent of \"subtract\" and \"compare\" in some case, or it create a synchronization point, like a set of buffer in a computer which align every address and data with a given \"clock\" signal.  In any electronic device, a comparison is a subtract operation for which only the sign is kept, the numeric result itself is discarded. In the case of neuron which need to compare two items, the pulse is transmitted only if the total number of inhibition pulses is lower then the normal pulses, within a time window. The exact threshold sensitivity will make the operation either act as \"at least\", \"about equal\" or \"most of\".  The major brain wave measured directly on the scalp are easy to detect because they involve a large number of neuron synchronized on a specific clock. For example, the gamma waves at 40 Hz are created by the visual processing. The retina transmit continuously the information about luminance from the rods and the two pairs of complementary colors computed from the 3 cones.   However, the recognition of edges, and the computing of local contrast/local brightness on every part of a 2d image, need a periodic \"erase/repaint\" operation. So, 40 times per second, a pulse is sent which inhibit the entire array of data for both visual fields, Since the clock inhibit millions of neuron at the same time (within a few microsecond), the electric signal is so strong that a small fraction gets coupled capacitively, crossing all layers of the cortex, the meninges, the bones and reach the surface of the scull, and can be picked-up by electrodes.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "uqU9lmFztOU", "cid": "UggzjrNfBo7wNHgCoAEC.8HLFzv5E4D78leGGDvcDhz", "comment": "Thats not a fro.. its his mind...", "votes": "8", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "uqU9lmFztOU", "cid": "UgiZIgZUvi_GRHgCoAEC.8FwDCkOe2eF8mnG0tbrZaI", "comment": "Wow let people be themselves.

BTW, much in the parietal and other areas is Associational cortex - those areas put things together and send signals on. The oversimplified limbic presentation previously has so far in the series ignored the actual types of memory -  which go from the transient to the LTP.  Memory slowly disappears from the Hippocampus as one lecturer said, into a more distributed form.  That autistic-savant photographic memory is like holding onto the sensory memory through short-term to long-term. I'd suspect that due to the general brain wiring, that some of the normally social context modular spaces in non-handicapped are repurposed for retention in the autistic (remember that this is a spectrum, in which, as an aside, males lean more toward autism than females; we all have some capacity to retask-repurpose, each coming from individual variation in brain wiring)  Memory is divided in more than one dimension, by declarative/explicit vs procedural/implicit(different \"systems\"), and by semantic vs episodic. As you study this (and you will; behavioral science requires it), you might still hear the old saw that \"procedural\" (inaccurately equated with nonconscious, though recent work has changed from that inaccuracy) is cerebellular/basal ganglia (close to and sharing somewhat with limbic, also a distributing network). Well, some cognitive actions in humans are associated with cerebellum, and some of the modular hypotheses are falling fast, including in other animals, big-time.  Sapolsky cautioned from the first that thinking within categories is extremely limited and very often false. Keep exploring and questioning previous dogma - Crick, remember, used the word as a joke, meaning that it may in the end be false.
