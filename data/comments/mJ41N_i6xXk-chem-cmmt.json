Feedback. Is there anyway to maybe put the questions of the examples at the top of the page or elsewhere? When I go to pause the video, the play/pause bar blocks the question and it's hard to make out what it says so I can write it down. Also when do you expect to finish this playlist?

In reaction stoichiometry we are using the coefficients to tell us the ratio of the moles that react for each substance. Here we have H2SO4 and 2NaOH reacting, so 1mole:2mole ratio. We can't use m1v1=m2v2 because the number of moles is not the same.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "mJ41N_i6xXk", "cid": "UgwwrCDgwOo3osn1c_V4AaABAg.A1dNuY0fOitA1jbcl6fOO5", "comment": "\u00a0@ChadsPrep\u00a0 oh i see!! thank you very much!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "mJ41N_i6xXk", "cid": "UgwwrCDgwOo3osn1c_V4AaABAg.A1dNuY0fOitA1ju1Iz1XzM", "comment": "\u00a0@bladelover4ever\u00a0 Very welcome", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "mJ41N_i6xXk", "cid": "UgzdNYTRPu9A0y3P-5V4AaABAg.9Vmzmbg8FN-9jUwm032zE-", "comment": "I have experienced this same difficulty.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
