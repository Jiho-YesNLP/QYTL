The derivation you worked out in another video that shows the change in Gibbs energy is simply the negative change of the entropy of the universe multiplied by the absolute temperature was particularly helpful. :)  I would like to challenge you on one point however - in several of the videos you describe the system at constant T and P ; and then you go one step further and declare the system at constant volume using ideal gas law.   I am wondering if this is an unnecessary restriction.  Using the closed form of the 1st law - and by differentiating the property relation h=u+pv, it is straightforward to show that Q=deltaH.  The only restriction is constant pressure and reversible boundary work.   In any case, isn't the constant T and V case managed with the Helmholtz free energy?  Thanks again for the videos and best of luck in your endeavors.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RoeLigz5vpo", "cid": "UggLphWfOywFC3gCoAEC", "comment": "i actually looked out of my window when i heard the siren.....ha...", "votes": "10", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RoeLigz5vpo", "cid": "Ugi2ODPgiC5BU3gCoAEC", "comment": "thank you!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RoeLigz5vpo", "cid": "UggAq3RePz3FlXgCoAEC", "comment": "good explanation !!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RoeLigz5vpo", "cid": "Ugg9LiCml60znngCoAEC", "comment": "Thank u a lot  \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RoeLigz5vpo", "cid": "UgwEkE-3bGjqBYmxeSF4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RoeLigz5vpo", "cid": "UgwFuaA-xLTaVLUBpmt4AaABAg", "comment": "Welcome!
