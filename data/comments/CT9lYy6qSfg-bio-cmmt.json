MIT should reflect on their advertisement! I literally watched more than 500 college-level videos offered by MIT and other prestigious institutes and this single one is among the best!  Since my comment is highlighted by the stuff, I'm gonna explain briefly why this video is so damn good. Dr. Eric Lander perfectly blended the story-telling into the lectures. He talked a lot of interesting anecdotes like Darwin's unfortunate ignoring of\u00a0Mendel or Chagarffe's sarcasm on Watson and Crick (another gorgeous video). Admittedly, a lot of people have tried this pedagogy but ended up in distracted and unimpressed narratives. Dr. Eric Lander, on the other hand, arranges every piece of historical events and experiments in a smooth, interactive and uncompromised way that makes the audience easily engaged and appreciate the beauty of biochemistry/genetics.  I also highly recommend 6.042J 2010 fall series (math for computer science). Another super-doped series. I literally cried and stood applauding at the end of that series.
