I am not sure you are right with your argument if your lecture should only be limited to \"cold atoms\". I have been watching your entire lectures not only to enjoy learning more but ALSO to find answer to some REAL PROBLEMS I am having at work to solve a degradation problem involving light-matter. The unfortunate truth is up to now nothing I can use (maybe) BECAUSE you have narrowed down the lecture to BEC. Danke Schoen sir :-) Happy New Year.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
