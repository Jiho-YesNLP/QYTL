If you want more professional advice, I recommend consulting with a professor at your university.  * calculus and linear algebra are essential to study ai algorithm and studying additional subjects like analysis or mathematical statistics will be helpful. * I'm preparing for the CFA exam to gain a broad knowledge of finance. You might want to look into it as well. It could be helpful to you. * This video is a summary of linear algebra, so it might be difficult to understand. First, study the overall content with Professor Gilbert Strang's book and the free MIT lectures, and then try this course * I'm not sure if studying all the lectures of the 'topic in mathematics applications with finance' course is overdoing it or not enough. Still, I think it's good to be prepared to this extent.

Therefore, this is a linear transformation from R^n -&gt; R^m.
