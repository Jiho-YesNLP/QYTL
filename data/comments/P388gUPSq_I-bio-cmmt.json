Inherited vs. heritable traits and epigenetics in behavior genetics  Understanding the difference between inherited and heritable traits is crucial in behavior genetics, particularly when examining the role of epigenetics in gene expression. Experimental design and critical evaluation of scientific studies are essential to shed light on the complex relationship between genetics and behavior.  2. Birth order's impact on IQ  A large study conducted in Norway showcased the impact of birth order on IQ, revealing that first-borns tend to have higher IQs than their younger siblings. This may be attributed to parental investment, tutoring roles, and family dynamics. Interestingly, the neoteny theory suggests that birth order advantages may reverse in later life.  3. Animal kin recognition mechanisms  Animals recognize their kin through a variety of methods, including innate recognition, lock and key mechanisms, and olfactory cues. For example, deer mice have a unique form of sperm competition, and rodents differentiate between siblings and non-siblings even when raised separately.  4. Signature proteins and MHC in immune system and olfactory recognition  Signature proteins on cells are essential for the immune system to recognize pathogens, but they also play a part in olfactory recognition in animals. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are detected through pheromones, enabling animals to discriminate relatedness. MHC genetic signatures are even reflected in urine smell, affecting organ transplant success.  5. Hormones and neurons in social bonding and smell recognition  The hormones oxytocin and vasopressin, along with neurons, play a significant role in social bonding and smell recognition, especially in identifying close relatives. Genetic mutations related to these hormones have been associated with autism. Social interaction fosters adult neurogenesis, and pregnancy can lead to changes in the olfactory system.  6. Recognizing relatives in the animal kingdom  Animals use sensory cues like smell, voice, and appearance for recognizing their relatives through innate recognition and imprinting. Olfactory receptors and hormones further sharpen their sensitivity to relatedness. While inbreeding can lead to genetic abnormalities, distant-relative mating provides kin selection advantages. Humans rely on cognitive processes for recognizing relatives.  7. The fusiform cortex's role in human relationships  The fusiform cortex, responsible for facial recognition, plays a role in human bonding. Newborns rely on their sense of smell for mother-infant bonding. Sensory-driven factors also contribute to human mate selection, and the concepts of pseudo kinship and pseudo-speciation manipulate human relationships, creating a sense of belonging among non-relatives.

Repeated administration of IQ tests affects the outcome of those tests. More importantly, height is actually defined (not measured) with incredible precision (even if there is a wide margin of measurement error, as in your example), and measurement is relatively objective. Height is the distance from the floor to the top of the child's head. If you measure 250,000 children with your device, you would also average out the error pretty well. But what would you do if you randomly assigned the children into two groups and found that one group was significantly taller than the other? That sort of error happens all the time, and it doesn't mean there is some sort of significance to their being assigned to one group or the other. Prof. Sapolsky talks about the importance of randomness in determining what we observe.  If you assess the IQ of 250,000 children, you don't know the objective, or \"actual\" IQ of any of those children, only your measurement, so you cannot validate the precision of your assessment. You can only assume its precision because it has been published and validated statistically - within certain constraints. The only way to validate its precision would be with repeated measures of the same individuals, which confounds the data. That limits the meaningfulness of small differences in IQ scores. They can never be tested to a great degree of precision.  The people who design IQ tests cannot say what drives the numbers up or down by only a few points. They cannot even define the concept of an actual, true value of a person's IQ beyond the repeatability of the result using a variety of means, each of which suffers from similar deficiencies in precision.  A difference of 2 cm is a meaningful difference in a child's height, by definition, but a difference of 2 IQ points is not defined as a difference in intelligence. It is defined as a difference in performance on a given IQ test. An IQ point is not a unit of measure. IQ truly is a self-referent statistic. It was intended to predict academic achievement, but it doesn't even do that well. It predicts how well you will do on your next IQ test, but it doesn't even do that with the kind of precision implied in that study.

And the point of having so many of them is that the difference cannot be a fluke. If there is a significant difference, there must be a reason for it.  Sure, the fact that we have measured the difference does not tell us why there is a difference (hence the discussion in the video). But there must be a reason.

(Statisticians usually scream those words through clenched teeth.) Having more subjects in each group does not affect the sensitivity of the instrument you use to measure them. Remember, every subject has a unique value, and each of those unique values is assessed only once at baseline and again at the end by an instrument that is both imprecise and inaccurate, within limits. There is no force of nature that requires it to even out with repetition.  Remember also that IQ is presumed to be unchanging, so the fact that a slight drift was detected is just as likely to reflect a limitation in the assessment as anything else, especially a change so small. But we know the raw IQ score DOESN'T remain constant, which is why these tests include a fairly crude correction factor for age when computing the score. Nobody in psych research would ever claim such a minute change as seen in the study described by Prof Sapolsky would be of any importance other than statistical, even if it were real. IQ tests do not measure what you apparently think they measure, and they are not nearly as precise, nor their scores as meaningful, as you seem to think they are.  I mentioned two tests I had over an ~18 year period. The more recent was 2 points higher than the earlier test. But there was also a third test. The two I mentioned were WAIS-R II and WAIS III, but during that time I also had a Stanford-Binet test. The range of scores, if you include that one, was 14 points, nearly a whole standard deviation, yet they were all validated tests for clinical and research use, and all administered by licensed professionals.  The variation in scores is really big, and it can't be averaged out across a population because the variance is different for each person. Unidentified subpopulations can have undue weight on the results. You're measuring the diameter of a blood cell with a yardstick, and that's not something the instrument is capable of doing, no matter how many cells you measure. The error in that range is arbitrary, and it is separately and independently arbitrary in each case.  The proper way to report meaningful data, if there were any, in such a study would be something called a repeated measures ANOVA with between-subjects variables for sex and environment, where average scores were not tested, but the change in individual scores were tested. It's been a while since I saw this lecture now, but I don't think they did that kind of analysis. I can't imagine increase or decrease in IQ score was detected in this study. The noise would be incredible at that resolution. I'd expect nearly all of the variance would be unexplained by the test variables. If they didn't do that kind of analysis, this is really junk science. If they try to assign meaning to changes in a test score that are undefined or below the threshold of detection by the test designers, again, junk science.  I love Prof Sapolsky, but I think he's presenting this study all wrong and giving it undue weight.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "P388gUPSq_I", "cid": "UgwoDsIhLRcU1t6ok0Z4AaABAg.9bfytPHLSGn9c_3Ta_3saQ", "comment": "\u00a0@beenaplumber8379\u00a0 You simply don't understand the problem.

That's what drives science. If we all agree, there are no questions remaining for science to answer. (I'm a retired neuroscientist.) And I'm sorry if I've misrepresented your position at all. However, we are still talking about different quantities, for whatever reason. Neither of us is talking about individual measurement of absolute IQ. You are talking about the average of IQ scores across an enormous sample size (which is reliable up to a point, but not very meaningful as differences decrease). I think that is the wrong metric.  I am talking about the differences in IQ over time, with sex and environment factored in. When you compare an individual's baseline score with their final score, then each individual serves as their own experimental control. It's much more powerful than comparing averages at the beginning and end of the study.  It's those differences in IQ score (which were apparently not reported), not the baseline and final score averages, that are not made meaningful or reliable by a large sample size. The minuscule difference, averaged across the vast sample size, and most likely within individuals, lies deep within the area of uncertainty of the test instrument, and well below the threshold of any real world meaning. The designers of the various IQ tests have never asserted that a fraction of an IQ point represents any functional difference whatsoever, even if the effect on the calculation of the scores is real.

The major histocompatability complex. Shared antigenic determinant. This sticks to all cells. Immune System.Don\u2019t attack said cell.  Autoimmune diseases think these are invasive. Trypanosome. Schistosome.  These are ultimately soluble. Give a unique signature to the pheromones coming off of you. They can tell if this is of a relative. There are gradations of recognition dependent on relatedness. You have a specifically shaped protein receptor. If the protein doesn\u2019t fit exactly, then it\u2019s a relative. Depending on how much and how long the proteins stay in the receptors.  Oxytocin, <-functions into pregnancy, then recognizing HSC signals. So then mother nurses. Vasopressin. Social anosmia. Inability to do it. ^High degree of this in families w/autism.  Adult neurogenesis. Hippocampus. Olfactory neurons are created. Females develop these olfactory neurons (and vaso and oxy have roles).  Why do you need to know who relatives are? You know who to interact with. Nobody paid attention to dominance reversal if they were related.  Avoid inbreeding, genetic defects. (Opposing argument: kin selection.) Mate with something like a third cousin: that is the balance.  McLintock study. Third cousins have the most attractive pheromones.

I personally think this is the response the professor was looking for, to transition into his next piece about first born's generally having a higher iq based on \"statistics.\" This point enforces the idea that sometimes we are not the authors of our own fate in this world, and that statistically sometimes people have better logical intelligence based nearly entirely on a factor that they had absolutely no control over, such as birth order. And also to show how simply reading the results of a study and not asking critical questions about that study, can be very misleading.

You do realize that not only does craps use TWO die, but the betting system allows for multiple options to win, therefore we start getting into unevenly distributed statistics. For instance, there is roughly a 17% chance of rolling 7, roughly 14% chance of rolling a 6 , roughly 11% chance of rolling 5, etc. etc. Because of how the game is designed there is a way to calculate probabilities.   When you are dealing with a single non-weighted tournament rules 6 sided die, you have an equal 16.66667% chance of rolling each number. Such as chutes and ladders (ya know the actual topic of the conversation, not sorry for the sarcasm) So if 100 people are playing, 16 might roll the correct number to hit a chute down to the victory. Does that make those 16 people better at the game? No... it is entirely based on chance.  As to your last comment, I believe it is sarcasm, though a very poor attempt at it.

Given that IQ tests are an incredibly consistent testing method (at least with respect to the variable of birth order), and given that we are talking about massive samples with repeatable predictability, there is definitely a correlation.

And quite possibly not a single one of those examples is actually an example of a random correlation. Most of those are totally bogus graphs that arbitrary scale or remove data which does not fit at all if you look at the whole picture or they never had a sufficient data set to begin with.   Suicides and aeronautical spending absolutely correlate, as does cheese spending and anything else associated with an increase in economic resources. Wealthier societies have higher suicide rates and more money to spend on space. The more direct correlation is wealth, but they are neither casual nor random. How did nic cage appear in 1.8 films in 2006? That alone tells you everything you need to know about the intellectual honesty of the person who compiled those \"data\" points and produced those graphs... There is no remotely accurate record of the number of people who strangled themselves to death in their bed sheets, and those stats only line up over a small segment when you zoom in on cheese consumption between 29 and 33 lbs per year. You get the point. We are not talking about comparing something with a sample size of four incidents per year to something with a sample size of 400,000 incidents per year, and we aren't overlaying 2% percent of one graph over 86.3% of another to create a roughly similar shape, where we still sometimes feel the need to make up data points and fabricate arbitrary curves that do not in any way correspond to the actual data.   Again, not saying random correlations don't exist, just saying that all evidence suggests this is not a random correlation. If the professor wants to throw this study out and the adoption studies out for frivolous reasons like this, then that makes the irreproducible and highly criticized studies he states as scientific fact absolutely laughable.  You made no attempt to address the logic of the heritability prediction i stated, and instead inserted your own irrelevant criticism of some other argument. If we expect low IQ parents to have more children, that means that children beyond a certain birth order threshold will be more likely to have lower IQ. Therefore when taken as the group of all non-firstborn children, their average IQ will necessarily be below the average firstborn IQ, even if birth order is completely non-causal.

From my perspective, there is a crucial difference between knowing what the state of the knowledge is and what methods are dominant at a certain time and actually knowing the history of a discipline. With the non-historical approach you would know the facts, yes, but you would have a really hard time coming up, in the future, with your own original and relevant study. Don't forget universities train people to be researchers, not living encyclopediae. By knowing where your discipline has been in the past, you have a broader comprehension of what is feasible and what is not, what has already been done and work or doesn't work, what kind of idea is associated with which specific field, etc.   Also I'm pretty sure humans have a much easier time learning when they are told stories rather than when they have to memorize all sorts of random facts unrelated to one another.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "P388gUPSq_I", "cid": "Ugza2-ktnb_FU467AsJ4AaABAg.8GbSbVR1bzR9PdXHMbRD_t", "comment": "I believe the real point of these lectures is actually to teach you HOW TO THINK.
