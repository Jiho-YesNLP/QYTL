I guess all the people who actually liked this or other lectures are probably already familiar with the material presented here, so they can easily bridge gaps and connect things. But this is my very first time learning the subject and I am completely confused, and constantly find myself in need to google everything to patch the explanations and re-order them in more logical way. However, the claim made in the very first lecture was that no prerequisites were required (although I did finish MIT 5.111 Principles of Chemical Science before starting this course, so I consider myself reasonably prepared).  The only lecture that I truly enjoyed was lecture #22 on neurons, the reason being that I already studied the Hodgkin-Huxley Model before (as part of MIT 9.40 Introduction to Neural Computation) and already knew the material one level deeper than what was explained. The lecture, in that case, was a breeze.  What is missing most, in my opinion, is meta-explanations: explaining what you are explaining, how these things connect and the sense of direction: where is this explanation going. You cannot simply jump from rather high-level overview of immunity into formation of MHC Class I peptide complex without any warning, so to speak. You need to explain why we are suddenly going into such level of details and bridge it properly with the previous explanations. I often find the order, the context and the proper connections missing.  Nevertheless, I am very thankful for being able to access these recordings online and for free, so I hope MIT continues to publish these materials.

There are many mechanistic ways cancer develops and each may require a different drug to stop oncogenic transformation. A loose analogy is saying, \"we need to stop crime\". There are MANY causes of crime and each would require a unique approach, although some overlap might exist in how we deal with each. Hope that makes sense. And yes, I agree.
