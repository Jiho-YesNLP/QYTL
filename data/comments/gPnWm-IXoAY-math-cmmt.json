There is a checkerboard of positive and negative signs that applies for determinants in general, when calculating them through sub-determinants.

Some books alternatively opt to use x-hat, y-hat, and z-hat.  The reason why i, j, and k are used in this context, has to do with quaternions.   William Rowan Hamilton discovered the concept of quaternions and saw their value when applying them to the study of machine dynamics.  He anticipated applying them to vector analysis in general, but the concept never really caught on with other mathematicians and scientists.   The notation still did catch on, and as a result, there are plenty of textbooks that use i, j, and k with hats to represent unit vectors of the coordinate axes.  Quaternions are an extension to the concept of imaginary and complex numbers.  In imaginary and complex numbers, we use i to represent the square root of -1, and build additive combinations of a real component not involving i, and an imaginary component that is multiplied by i.   With quaternions, we have a unit term that identifies each of the three coordinate axes, that have properties in common with imaginary numbers.   Most notably, when you square any one of the unit quaternions, you end up with -1.

The input vectors don't necessarily need to be perpendicular.   When they are not perpendicular, the output cross product vector will still be perpendicular to both of them, and in a direction determined by the right hand rule.  Simply let your middle finger rotate to a position other than perpendicular to your index finger.  Your thumb will still identify the direction of the cross product resultant.  The magnitude of the cross product will be the area of a parallelogram, defined by the two vectors as two of the adjacent sides of the shape.   You can use this as a shortcut for finding the area of a triangle among three points in space in general.  Find a vector between point A and point B, and another vector between point A and point C.

The proof depends on it already being established that a dot product of zero means perpendicular vectors.  The N-dimensional cross product doesn't really exist, as it is a concept which is only defined in 3-dimensional vector spaces.  You can cross two 2-d vectors, and the result is perpendicular to the plane of both of them, requiring 3-d space to work with all three vectors.  You can cross two 1-d vectors, and the result is guaranteed to be zero.  But for 4-d vectors, there is no cross product defined.
