Forget about imaginary numbers, and focus on real numbers only.   What is the minimum x-value, and the maximum x-value that you can plug in to this equation.   In order for the square root to be real, the contents of it need to either be positive or zero.   This means the maximum x^2 can be is 1, which means x ranges from -1 to +1.  However, at these extremes of the domains, we run in to another problem of a zero in the denominator.  So our domain is -1 < x < +1, with exclusions of -1 and +1.  As x approaches these extreme points, the value of the function approaches positive infinity, due to the function being positive just before this, and due to the denominator approaching zero.   So this lets us know that y < infinity is part of the range  Intuitively, something interesting will also happen at x=0.   But we can also prove it by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.  This allows us to calculate that x=0 is a critical point, which might be a minimum or maximum.  d/dx 1/sqrt(1-x^2) = x/(1-x^2)^(3/2) Which equals zero at x=0  Take the second derivative, to determine if this is a minimum or a maximum. d^2/dx^2 1/sqrt(1-x^2) = (2*x^2 + 1)/(1-x^2)^(5/2)  Evaluate the second derivative at x=0, and get a positive number, indicating that this is a local minimum.

This means that the area of the base of the box will be (2*X)^2.   You'll see why we choose to work with the half-width instead of the full width, very soon.   We know that X can at a minimum equal zero, and at a maximum equal R, so we will only be interested in critical points within this range.  Create an equation for the hemispherical dome, in terms of horizontal positions x and y.  Equation of a sphere: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2  Equation of the positive half of the sphere: z = sqrt(R^2 - x^2 - y^2)  Your box will have a corner at a point where y=x, and also equals capital X.   Use the previous equation to determine H, the height of the box. H = sqrt(R^2 - 2*X^2)  Now define V for the volume of the box: V = H*(2*X)^2  Simplify: V = 4*H*X^2  Plug in H, and now we have our objective equation only in terms of the variable X: V = 4*X^2*sqrt(R^2 - 2*X^2)   Take the derivative dV/dX, which we will set to zero to look for the critical value of X where V is maximum.  Along the way, you'll be using the product rule, the chain rule, and the power rule.  I'll skip the steps and jump right to the result. dV/dX = (8*X*(R^2 - 3*X^2))/sqrt(R^2 - 2*X^2)  We are interested in where dV/dX = 0, but we also need to watch out for locations where the denominator is also zero.   Because if these coincide, we have a hole in the function instead of a zero.  Locations where numerator equals zero:  Trivial answer at X = 0, due to 8*X equaling zero at this point.  More interesting answer: R^2 - 3*X^2 = 0 Solve for X: X = R/sqrt(3)  Denominator of zero: R^2 - 2*X^2 = 0 Solve for X: X = R/sqrt(2)  Since these do not coincide, it is acceptable to conclude that X = 0 and X = R/sqrt(3) are our critical points where dV/dX = 0.   What ends up happening at X=R/sqrt(2), is that you have the maximum possible square base that can be inscribed in the circle, and its height is zero.   We know X=0 is not the maximum, because the box would have no thickness and thus no volume.  Therefore, we conclude the critical point X = R/sqrt(3) is the location where the volume is maximized.   This means that the box's base dimensions are each equal to 2*R/sqrt(3), and the box's height is R/sqrt(3).", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pvLj1s7SOtk", "cid": "UgycUnvlkTUx8xs1swN4AaABAg.9GSFsg0kdYl9WOEmW8IJ_s", "comment": "\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 please help me I have a request to you.

These aren't necessarily the minima/maxima, but they are important points to know.  These are locations where there could be a vertical asymptote, meaning the function approaches either positive or negative infinity, or both from opposite sides.  This would mean the maximum or minimum is unlimited, as immediately adjacent to the pole, would be an extremely large output.  That is, unless a pole coincides with a zero in the numerator, at which point there will be a removable singularity.  If there are no real solutions to the denominator equaling zero, it is in your favor, because this means you will have no singularities.  Since this is a quadratic expression, we can use the quadratic formula to find where the denominator equals zero.  To the tune of pop goes the weasel: \"x is equal to negative b, plus and minus the square root; of b squared minus 4*a*c, all over 2*a.\"  Next, we are interested in locations where dy/dx = 0, which means the function will be locally flat, and reach a turning point.  Take the derivative, and set it equal to zero.  Rewrite as y = k/f(x) dy/df = k*1/f^2 dy/dx = dy/df * df/dx = k/f(x)^2 * f'(x)  Take derivative f'(x) = 2*a*x + b, per the power rule.  Reconstruct: dy/dx = k*(2*a*x + b)/(a*x^2 + b*x + c)^2  The only way that this function can equal zero, is when 2*a*x + b = 0.  Solve for x to be x = -b/(2*a).  This will mean that the extreme point will occur at x = -b/(2*a).  Take the second derivative and evaluate at x=-b/(2*a), to determine if this is a local minimum (positive 2nd derivative) or a local maximum.  This will be the only instance where there is a local extreme point that isn't part of a singularity.  The second derivative evaluated at this point equals -(32*k*a^3)/(4*a*c - b^2)^2.  When --k*a^3 is positive, you'll have a local minimum.  When -k*a^3 is negative, you'll have a local maximum.  Note that in the event that b^2 - 4*a*c = 0, then you will also have a denominator equal to zero in the original function at the same point where the derivative equals zero.  This means it is inconclusive to call it a local minimum or maximum, because this will also coincide with a vertical asymptote.  Ideally, b^2-4*a*c <0, and there are no real roots.  This means -b/(2*a) will be conclusive as either a minimum or maximum, and you will have no vertical asymptotes.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "pvLj1s7SOtk", "cid": "UgycUnvlkTUx8xs1swN4AaABAg.9GSFsg0kdYl9WOU0TzQxCu", "comment": "\u00a0@simon-gh1pt\u00a0  As for y=k/(|x - a| + |x - b|), this one has another unique challenge in that the denominator function is not differentiable.

Suppose we need to transport cargo from an island to a warehouse.  Consider a straight shoreline that runs east-west, and the warehouse is L=100 km east of the island, also on the shore.  Assume the road runs directly along the shore and any inland travel distance to get to the road is negligible.  The island is d=50 km south of the shore.   We need to determine where along the shoreline to build our dock for unloading the ship, that will minimize the amount of fuel consumed.  Suppose a truck takes 1 liter of fuel to drive 1 km (a rate we can call T) and suppose a ship takes 5 liters of fuel to transport the same cargo a distance of 1 km (a rate we'll call S).  Define the origin at the point on the shore directly across the water from the island, and define distance x as the position along this shore where the dock could be located.   Assume only a 1-way trip for simplicity.  A: find an expression for the fuel consumed by the truck, as a function of dock location x B: find an expression for the fuel consumed by the ship, as a function of dock location x C: find a function f(x) for the total fuel consumed, by combining expressions from parts A and B.  Answer: f(x) = T*(L-x) + S*sqrt(x^2 + d^2) D: Take the derivative of this function. E: Set this derivative equal to zero, and solve for the optimal value of x that minimizes fuel consumption.

In this context, second derivative test refers to the single variable Calculus second derivative test, which means you check the sign of the curvature (i.e. whether it is concave-up or concave-down) in addition to the slope.    Given a point where the first derivative is zero, you check the sign of the second derivative to determine whether a critical point is a local maximum or a local minimum.  If the second derivative is negative, it is a local maximum, because the function is concave-down (negative curvature).   The critical point is at the \"top of a hill\".  \r If the second derivative is positive, it is a local minimum, because the function is concave-up (positive curvature).   The critical point is at the \"bottom of a basin\".  A second derivative of zero is inconclusive.  You'll need to check additional derivatives beyond the second derivative.  The next even-order derivative (e.g. 4th derivative) that is non-zero will tell you the conclusion of whether it is a local maximum or local minimum.  If no additional even order derivatives are positive or negative, then you have an inflection point coinciding with a point of zero slope, as you see in the graph of y=x^3.
