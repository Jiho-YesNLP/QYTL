A lot fewer steps, which can make your code run faster, if you've got a programming code that runs hundreds if not thousands of the same calculation.

The OP just limited the statement to real numbers, to keep it simple, as a lot more can happen with complex numbers that you might not anticipate.  Therefore, you generally avoid acknowledging that a rule also works for complex numbers if that is beyond the scope of a particular class or topic.  You then limit your domain to real numbers so that you don't accidentally give an incorrect statement for how the rule works with complex numbers.  To differentiate i^x relative to x, you rewrite it in its alternative form of e^((i*pi*x)/2).  Define k=i*pi/2, and rewrite as e^(k*x).   Now differentiate with the chain rule, and get k*e^(k*x).   Recall the value of k, and rewrite.  You will get: 1/2*i*pi*e^(1/2*i*pi*x), which you can replace the base e term with the original expression i^x, and write as 1/2*i*pi*i^x.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_x1nCg2LfuA", "cid": "Ugynndsg0ZEWz7EDwBJ4AaABAg.8dsBzTOr2cQ9c29tmLwUn0", "comment": "\u00a0@reubenmanzo2054\u00a0 My method shows that this works if you didn't already have established how to determine ln(i).
