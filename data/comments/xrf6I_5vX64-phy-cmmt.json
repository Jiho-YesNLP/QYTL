It is this electric field that causes the electrons in the conductor to move as so well described! This cannot be stressed enough, and is something most other creators on YouTube have ignored. The source of the electric field is in fact the battery. A battery does not provide or consume electrons to the circuit per se, in the manner as most people think, but it provides the electric field which provides the force to the electrons that causes the electrons to move. Then a chemical reaction in the battery \"absorbs\" the excess electrons that happen to collect at the positive terminal (technically \"reduction\"), while a complementary reaction (technically \"oxidation\") provides extra electrons needed in the circuit at the negative terminal, but which are really created to balance the reduction reaction. They just happen to be available for the circuit which makes the whole thing work.

If you know how many volts you have and you want to know how many joules of energy your circuit is using it also requires knowing the resistance of the circuit and the time.    Let's simplify your question by saying you have a 1 V battery and want to know what conditions would supply 1 J of energy.  1 Joule of energy (E) is dissipated by using 1 watt of power (P) for 1 second (t); E=P\u00d7t  1 Watt is the amount of electrical work performed when 1 ampere of current (I) flows across a potential difference of 1 volt (V). P=I\u00d7V  1 Ampere is equal to 1 volt over a resistance (R) of 1 ohm; I=V/R.  By substituting you can combine these formulas into one: I=V/R and P=I\u00d7V therefore P= V^2/R. P= V^2/R and E=P\u00d7t therefore E=V^2\u00d7t/R.  So, in order for a 1V battery to supply 1J of energy, it has to be connected to a circuit drawing 1 amp of current across a 1 ohm resistor for 1 second.    If you want a 5 volt battery to supply 5 joules,  you have to change the values of the resistance and/or time so that the math in the formula E=V^2\u00d7t/R comes out to be 5 joules. For example, 5 volts across 5 ohms for 1 second, 5 volts across 10 ohms for 2 seconds, etc.  Does that answer your question?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "xrf6I_5vX64", "cid": "UgxKdkWpPaNbjS7SyMt4AaABAg.98Mo2kPmMMC98v0PQc5ygu", "comment": "Fuck sake I\u2019m trying to learn how to buy this makes completely no sense", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "xrf6I_5vX64", "cid": "UgzfuD8gDGJpDr6EIn94AaABAg.98J9GteONZ79MPA8SZQgR-", "comment": "No because batteries have internal resistance.
