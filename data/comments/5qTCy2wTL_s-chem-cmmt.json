Across a period the increase in Z effective overpowers the increase of the average distance(radius) from sub shell to nucleus. Therefore it makes sense that Boron has a smaller atomic radius than Beryllium. However, the ionization energy of Boron is less than Beryllium as mentioned in the previous video. This doesn't make sense because if the ionization energy of Boron is smaller than Beryllium, this surely means Boron has a larger radius (or vice versa).  Lower ionization energy of Boron's valence electron should also mean that the electron is not that deep in the energy well; it has a relatively high electric potential energy when compared with beryllium's valence electrons.  Is it safe to assume that atomic radius is more arbitrary so instead we should take orbital shapes into account? Since 2p orbitals are dumbbell in shape, could we assume that even though the atomic radius of the Boron atom is smaller, its valence electron in the 2px orbital encompasses a wider area (so to speak) than beryllium's 2s electrons and also has a higher electric potential energy therefore. I believe that would feasibly explain this irrationality.   Of course, one could probably attempt to explain ionization energy and atomic radius separately but when the ideas are put together there is a conundrum.", "votes": "0", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5qTCy2wTL_s", "cid": "Ugj8OAlsDd9uqXgCoAEC", "comment": "The actual lecture start\u00a0 at 8:50 .........", "votes": "12", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5qTCy2wTL_s", "cid": "UgxiN_y3fGOSoOgQ8aN4AaABAg", "comment": "what happens if two electron wants to appear in the same location?
