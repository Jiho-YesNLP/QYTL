A new atmosphere formed around the earth, due to the gases being very light but still bound by the Earths gravity. These gases, such as hydrogen, methane and water vapour, were pushed out to the atmosphere due to volcanic eruptions in the early earth, since eruptions occurred very often. These gases then made a layer just right to allow light in and also reflects light back out to space. Meaning enough heat and UV radiation is kept within the earths surface, keeping it warm enough to sustain life, and most of the harmful rays are reflected back out to space. This all happened by the pure chance that the early earth had the right molecules in the right quantity to make an atmosphere that allowed for life. It could have also produced one that was unfit to sustain life, hence we are very lucky.
