The set of possible roots we are looking for is made from making unique positive or negative fractions with factors of 16 on top and 15 on the bottom. These are +- 1/5, +- 2/5, +- 1/3, +- 2/3, +- 1 and +- 2.   2) Now you do synthetic division checking some of the possible answers. Its easier to start with the whole numbers, like -2 or 1. If you do it for -2 you will find it is one of the answers. The equation is now (x + 2)(15x^3 - 29x^2 + 6x + 8).   3) When one of the possible answers is 1, there is a trick we can use to quickly see if it is an answer. If the coefficients sum to 0, that means 1 is an answer. 15 - 29 + 6 + 8 = 0, so that means 1 is the next answer. We still want to do the synthetic division with 1, just to get the new coefficients (at least that's how I did it). Now we have (x + 2)(x - 1)(15x^2 - 14x -8).  4) Since our highest degree is now 2, we can let 15, -14 and -8 be a, b, c and plug them into the quadratic formula. This will show that the final two answers are 4/3 and -2/5.   5) Therefore, x = -2, 1, 4/3, -2/5  Hope this helped.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgwEy2rxiOg5-TZWnHx4AaABAg", "comment": "Great explanation", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgwDjax_ItQaU-i9zKF4AaABAg", "comment": "Outstanding explanation on how to do synthetic division!

This could give you all the solutions you need.  However, this method will only work to find all the solutions, if all the solutions are rational real numbers in the first place.  If there is a mixture of rational roots and irrational roots, then you'd first find the rational roots with the rational root theorem and trial and error.  Then you'd need to use polynomial division to reduce the polynomial, in order to find the irrational roots.  He deliberately set up his examples, so that he could reduce it to a quadratic to find the irrational roots, and that is the only case where you can find irrational roots that are simple roots of an integer.

For cubic and quartic equations, there are equivalents of the quadratic formula, that would allow you to analytically calculate the roots, but these formulas are rarely taught outside a math degree, as they are difficult to use, and require a detour to complex numbers to find the real solutions in many cases.   For quintics and higher, Galois proved that it is impossible for such a formula using algebraic operations to even exist.  A brief overview of the cubic formula: Step 1: Divide through by a, to make it monic Step 2: Do a change of variables to shift it horizontally, so the second term reduces to zero.  This and step 1, allow us to reduce any cubic from a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d, to the form of t^3 + p*x + q.   The constants p and q will both equal expressions that combine the original constants a/b/c/d. Step 3: find the discriminant, capital D.  D = p^3/27 + q^2/4.  If D is positive, there is just one real solution.  If D is negative, there will be 3 real solutions, which will either require a detour to the complex numbers to find, or use of the trigonometric cubic formula.  If D is zero, this means we have at least one repeated real root. Step 4: use the reduced cubic formula, t = cbrt(-q/2 + sqrt(D)) + cbrt(-q/2 - sqrt(D))  When D is positive, this will find the one real solution.  Example to try: t^3 - 15*t - 126.  When D is zero, this will find the distinct real solution.  Example to try: t^3 - 12*t + 16 You could detour to the complex roots of each cbrt() term, which will be a conjugate pair in both cases, that add up to the remaining solution.  Or use the distinct real solution with polynomial division, to find the quadratic with a repeated root.  D can also equal zero in the trivial case where both p=0 and q=0, which will mean a thrice-repeated solution of t=0.  When D is negative, you'll have cube roots of complex numbers, that themselves are complex.  Example to try: t^3 - 6*t + 4 There will be 3 cube roots of the first expression, and 3 cube roots of the second expression.   Among all of them, there will be three conjugate pairs that add up to the 3 real solutions.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgzVtgG28M4g1Sq9H7R4AaABAg.9nanv7Jptx29zStLGuS4RY", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@carultch\u00a0 It sounds scary but fun at the same time", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgwYBFt9TuJSLQBZCDZ4AaABAg", "comment": "I'll skip this one, It's boring", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgzrkCIL04_DzQT9vEN4AaABAg", "comment": "THANKKK YOUUU SO MUCHHH", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgyEgYWAscehnu76pSZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Ty, my brain grew stronger after that.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgycJd6jsyGVdXLzgBZ4AaABAg", "comment": "What if the roots are in decimal for example 0.5 or 3/2 etc.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgzeQJIC3zaqlL7iIRF4AaABAg", "comment": "Luv you\ud83d\ude18", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgzBBu3ExbRxkjjNdap4AaABAg", "comment": "Tip -we can check solution faster by direct putting possible solution in equation.If equation satisfies than we can continue with division method .", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "Ugzpow7oQXMc7caKk7B4AaABAg", "comment": "Man! it was live saving!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgyG7aEcO9t33Q_p2Fl4AaABAg", "comment": "I don t understand  (factors of the constat term)", "votes": "1", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "Ugz78gUY0JTvYYIqeat4AaABAg", "comment": "but i got like 40 possible factors for polynomial in checking comprehension. you literally need more than an hour to solve that. or am i doing something wrong?", "votes": "3", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgxuNrY7_FwMmcrEysV4AaABAg", "comment": "what if there is no constant term in initial equation ? how to find possible solutions?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "Ugwf3_OTBBO0VFzqmNt4AaABAg", "comment": "absolute chad\ud83d\uddff", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "Ugy_8nAYRNPNXK-epfF4AaABAg", "comment": "x^4+6x^2+4x+2?

The rational root theorem tells you what you have as candidates for rational solutions to the polynomial equaling zero.  You select from those candidates, and use trial and error to determine which ones are roots to the polynomial.  Not all of them will be, so this is all strategic trial and error.  You can also use the signs as clues to the signs of the roots.  If there are only positive signs on all terms, this means that most of your roots will be negative.

The roots also must add up to -b/a (where a and b are the first and second coefficients respectively), and multiply to k/a*(-1)^n, where k is the final constant and (-1)^n is an alternator that is positive for even degree polynomials, and negative for odd degree polynomials.

Back when I was an engineering student the course was already crammed to the gills with a wide range of topics, most of which proved useless in my subsequent career.  At the time they served the function of an obstacle course in which only the tough survive. The same thing must be at work in academic mathematics programs - only the most dedicated will survive.  With both engineering and mathematics expanding in scope year by year it becomes a necessity at some point to specialize or narrow the scope of courses. Frankly, although this material is ingenious, it does smack a bit of rote learning.  Let's face it if in a subsequent career one is faced with solving polynomials in the higher degrees there are quicker and more practical means at our disposal.

Galois proved that there can be no quintic formula, or anything beyond, if you are limited to arithmetic, powers, roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometry.  In special cases, it is possible to extract the roots of a higher degree polynomial, despite no such formula existing, but only in those special cases.  Such as triquadratic 6th degree equations, where you can simply replace x^3 with w, and solve for w.  You can also use the rational roots theorem and trial and error, if you are lucky enough to have a rational root.  I can refer you to Mathologer's video on how to make sense of the cubic formula, which I've mastered after exploring on my own with his help.  He also reveals the quartic formula at the end, but I've yet to make sense of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-KXStupwsc", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgxI60F6Iuveg0gQump4AaABAg.9654w1WGyIF9DfdlrBkc5A", "comment": "we appreciate this chief", "votes": "25", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgxI60F6Iuveg0gQump4AaABAg.9654w1WGyIF9KDzm92_R37", "comment": "no way!!! is this real?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "WRkgMDVIETE", "cid": "UgxI60F6Iuveg0gQump4AaABAg.9654w1WGyIF9KE0ytgQrZq", "comment": "\u00a0@aarohansharma4551\u00a0 Try it lmao, what do you need?

Once you reduce a higher degree polynomial to a quadratic, you can use the quadratic formula to find its roots that are part of the quadratic factor.  The reason the rational roots test works, is that for polynomials in general in the following form, the roots will all multiply to k/a for even degree polynomials, and -k/a for odd degree polynomials. a*x^n + b*x^(n - 1) + ... other terms ... + k  To figure out why it works, consider the general polynomial factored as: a*(x - r1)*(x - r2)*(x - r3)*....*(x - rn)  When you expand it out, the final constant term will equal: a*product -r_m, from m=1 to n =  a*-r1*-r2*-r3*...*-rn  If there are an even number of roots, there are an even number of minus signs, which render this term to have the same sign as the product of roots.
