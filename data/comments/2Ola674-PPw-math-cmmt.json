As a result, the eigenvalues are real (as expected from a symmetric matrix), but the eigenvectors have complex entries.  What he does not do, which I think is a major omission, is to show (it's very simple) that if y=a+bi is a complex eigenvector for a real eigenvalue, then Re(y) and Im(y) are also eigenvectors, but Re(y) is a real eigenvector.  So, if we were hoping for our eigenvectors to form the basis of some real space, this is what we want.  Furthermore, if people are playing along at home and using Matlab to verify various things they try, Matlab returns the real eigenvectors, so it would be nice if the text were better at facilitating this helpful learning device.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "2Ola674-PPw", "cid": "Ugg8Qb_PEOqFw3gCoAEC", "comment": "At 38:00, be careful.  He says pi^2, etc. are the eigenvalues of the matrix.  This is not quite true.  The book explains why, in the discrete fixed-fixed case, the eigenvalue is 2-2cos(k*pi*h), and why this makes sense, and how it connects to (k*pi)^2, including the h^2 that is supposed to be included with the 2nd difference matrix K.

There are also sin k*3*pi*x and sin k*4*pi*x.  You might ask, if those work, why not sin k*5*pi*x, sin k*6*pi*x, etc.  Well, sin k*5*pi*x is the zero vector, since n=4.  For 6 through 9, you get negatives of eigenvectors you already had, so they're not new eigenvectors.  From 10 on, since there's a shift of 2*pi involved, you get duplicates of what you already had.
