For functions from R2 -> R1, we would have square pillars instead of these rectangles that we \"add up\" and do a similar limiting process to get the riemann integral. You can then generalize this to functions Rn -> Rm. The second course by MIT, 18.02 covers this in detail.\r \r Then there are many directions you may go for more advanced forms of integration. You can learn about some very common mathematical objects, Manifolds, and how you can do integration on them. The euclidean space Rn is one (trivial) example of a manifold, and so is a donut (or the universe for that matter). You can learn this typically in a graduate course on differentiable manifolds.\r \r Another sort of more advanced integral is the Lebesgue integral. This is the study of \"measure\" (referred to as measure theory) and is covered in a graduate course in Real Analysis. In studying integrals, you have likely encountered integrals where the integral did not exist, like say a function that is 1 for rationals and 0 for irrationals, called the Dirichlet function. The Lebesgue integral fixes some issues we have seen with the Riemann integral and allows us to integrate functions we could not otherwise.\r \r For the Dirichlet function I just described, there are far far more irrationals that rationals, so in essence, the function should be \"almost\" 0 right? And the Lebesgue integral for that function is in fact 0, but it is definitely not Riemann integrable. Now when it comes to functions that are Riemann integrable, it gives us the same result! That is we lose nothing, and can integrate a larger class of functions.\r \r If you are interested in learning more, I can provide some references for books or lecture series.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "hjZhPczMkL4", "cid": "UgwLJo24BbGI6mjUsnB4AaABAg.9Dia9eo9Ynz9DkbYAkNHrO", "comment": "As the description states, \"Lecture 17 is Exam 2, so no video was recorded.\"", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "hjZhPczMkL4", "cid": "UgwQvBGZ6MuAibV4H3Z4AaABAg", "comment": "He's a Hero.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hjZhPczMkL4", "cid": "Ugy5awX9lmp7V9QRrkh4AaABAg", "comment": "Brilliant", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hjZhPczMkL4", "cid": "UgxJCEnWxNUoXapAWyp4AaABAg", "comment": "Why slope is 2?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hjZhPczMkL4", "cid": "UgzpfPdQj6mIZdSKpNh4AaABAg", "comment": "Of all the lectures in this course, this was the least understood.
