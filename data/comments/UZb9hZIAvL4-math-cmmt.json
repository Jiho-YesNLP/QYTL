For instance if you are going to compute the integral of x^2 dx from x=0 to x=1. If you want to do the substitution u=-x, you will similarly get du=-dx. The negative sign means we are multiplying by -1 which can also be thought of as the one-dimensional Jacobian. However, in this case we are not allowed to take absolute value because it will change the value of the integral. Ie, (if we take absolute values also in one-dimensional case) the integral in variable u will become integral (-u)^2 |-1| du from u=0 to u=-1. Which further becomes -1/3.
