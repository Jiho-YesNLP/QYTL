For some reason derivatives always made sense to me, so I guess it was more convenient for me to think of integrals that way. Anyways, I was hoping someone could please explain this a little further.

Even though sound propagate by means of elastic collisions between molecules, speed of sound should depend upon the speed of molecules near the source of sound. Yes I have heard it already that  molecule speed is directly proportion with the increase in pressure so the bulks module remains constant and hence the formula holds.

This is because the denominator in the fraction is there thanks to Einstein, who realized at higher speeds the momentum increases less and less. As a quick example of my point, solve the denominator where c = 3x10^8m/s and v = 3x10^2m/s. You should get p=mv/.999999999999499... If you use v = 3X10^6m/s you'll get p=mv/.99994999... And if you use v = 2x10^8m/s you'll get p=mv/.745355... So when v << c (velocity is significantly less than the speed of light) this denominator is so close to 1 that it will have minimal effect on our answer, thus we choose to omit it for simplicity's sake. However for any velocity close to the speed of light, we need to use that denominator to get a correct answer. For collision examples in most textbooks you will be dealing with velocities significantly less than 3x10^8m/s and many basic physics courses won't introduce high speed momentum.
