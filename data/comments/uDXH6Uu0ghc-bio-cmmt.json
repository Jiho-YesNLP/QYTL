I guess I am not too much qualified to answer this question, but this is in my syllabus, so I am going to answer the question.  First of all, as you said \"(46, XY)\" chromosome it is completely incorrect it is actually (44, XY) chromosome. and the real answer to your question is both X and Y chromosomes are there (not on the same haploid cell) but on different cells. And as During anaphase, sister chromatids (or homologous chromosomes for meiosis I), will separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, pulled by microtubules, the x and y chrm separate and goes to different sperms.
