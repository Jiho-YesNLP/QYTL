So if you have extreme difficulties in school in general, I hope this helps you in some way or another. (Also these notes may be wrong since I am not the smartest person out there and I might've misunderstood something because English is not...my first language.) FLVS is incredibly hard for me.\r \r  \r  \r Photosynthesis is respiration in reverse, and in order to work photosynthesis needs h20 and c02 and sunlight.\r \r \ud83c\udf43 How does it get those things?                                                                                                 \r   The roots absorb the water, bringing to the leaves through Xylem. c02 gets in, but the O gets out through the stomata. (Tiny pores in the leaves). Individual photons are absorbed in the plant by chlorophyll.\r \r _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r \r  Chloroplast\r \r Chlorophyll is stashed in the thylakoids, and the thylakoids are stacked in grana. Inside the thylakoid there\u2019s lumen and outside the thylakoid is the stroma. \r \r - The thylakoid membranes are phospholipid bilayers, which means that they are really good at maintaining concentration gradient of ions, proteins, etc. Which also means keeping the concentration higher on one side than the other of the membrane.\r \r \r Stage I: A photon by the fusion reactions of our sun quite literally ends its journey by slapping into a chlorophyll molecule. When chlorophyll gets hit by that photon, an electron absorbs that energy and becomes \u201cexcited\u201d. (Electrons gain energy but don\u2019t have anywhere to put it and when it\u2019s done by a photon it\u2019s called photoexcitation.) Now, we convert the energy of those\u2026electrons,  into something that the plant can use. \r \r _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r \r (This is where you start to ask yourself: \u201cwhy did I take a Biology class?\u201d)\r \r Photosystem II is the first of four protein complexes that plants need for light dependent reactions. Which is also called plastoquinone Oxidoreductase\u2026 (I don\u2019t think I need to know that but I just wanted to make fun of it, really.) or, PSII.  \r \r - PSII and the rest of the protein complexes straddle the membrane of the thylakoids in the chloroplasts.\r \r \r \u2618 The electron transport chain                                                                                                                                                                                        Energized electrons lose their energy in a series of reactions that capture the energy that is needed to not kill life.\r \r PSII\u2019s chlorophyll now has this electron that is so \u201cexcited\u201d that when a special protein that steals electrons shows up the electron leaps off of the chlorophyll molecule onto the protein. (Mobile electron carrier.) The chlorophyll then starts to \u201cpanic\u201d and it steals one of the H20\u2019s electrons to replenish the one that it lost. The byproduct: hydrogen ions and oxygen. \r \r _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r \r All energized electrons from PSII have been picked up by electron carriers and now are being transported into the second protein complex. The Cytochrome process! Yay! (Why am I here?) \r \r The Cytochrome process:\r \r -Serves as an intermediary process between PSII and PSI.\r \r -Uses a bit of the energy from the electron to pump another proton into the thylakoid.\r \r \ud83e\udeb4 Why are we doing this?                                                                                                                                                                                                      What we\u2019re doing, is charging the thylakoid as a battery. By bumping the thylakoid full of protons, we are creating a concentration gradient. The protons then push each through an enzyme straddling ATP Synthase, and that enzyme uses that energy to pack an inorganic phosphate onto the ADP, making ATP.\r \r Photosystem I\r \r PSI is a similar mix of proteins and molecules that we say in PSII, but with some different products.  After some protons \u201cre-excite\u201d a couple of electrons, the electron pops off and catches a ride with the electron carrier. This time, all that energy will be used to make NADPH which exists to carry energy around. Then, another enzyme helps combine two electrons and one hydrogen ion with NADP+. In photosynthesis, NADP+ is crucial to energy conversion, and when it takes on two electrons and one hydrogen ion it turns into NADPH.\r \r Now, what\u2019s left is chemical energy in the form of, oxygen, ATPs, and NADPH.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   The Calvin Cycle, (sometimes called the dark reactions, light independent reaction, or stage 2) doesn\u2019t require energy from the photons. Stage 2 uses the energy from the ATPs and NADPHs created in Stage 1, to produce something useful for the plant.\r \r The Calvin Cycle starts in the stroma. This phase is called \u201ccarbon fixation\u201d. CO2 is fixed to RuBP with the help of ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxidase, or as anyone else would prefer to call it, RuBisCo.  (Which I will not take note of what it is or anything because I cannot take this.)\r \r So, RuBP gets a C02 slammed into it (\u2026) and then the whole thing gets unstable. It can only be stable again if this new six-carbon chain to separate itself creating two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. \r Reduction: Now, we need some energy, so some ATP slams a phosphate group onto the 3-phosphoglycerate, and NADPH pops some electrons on and, now we have two molecules of G3P.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \u2026I\u2019ll finish this later.

I'm just watching out of natural curiosity to learn more so i can maybe someday answer, or have answered,  some questions I have about the beginning of life.      *I am not a creationist and these questions are not to generate false debate. Like many others, I would simply like to know how atoms got together to become life!    1. Why did some (organic) molecules start needing other molecules for energy (food)?        Perhaps it started by molecule A accidentally running into another molecule, say CH4 (methane?) , which A naturally stripped off the C due to it's molecular structure and discarded      the H and retained the C which made itself bigger, which adding more C changed it's structure which changed how it reacted with different molecules, etc...I'm just making this up lol   2. Why did these molecules convert and store food molecules to use for energy (energy for what? to duplicate themselves?  Why do they duplicate themselves?)???   3.  How do these molecules  gain \"desire\" to actively seek out the food molecules it wants/needs?  Shouldn't a clump of matter just sit there and only react to whatever happens to run into it?    4. What is the difference between a living cell and a dead cell?   there must be something missing in a dead cell that a living cell has, right? so if you reintroduce the missing item shouldn't the dead cell regain animation?  I know it depends on how it died, but assuming the simplest way of killing it without undo destruction.   5.  What generates the electricity in a Neuron (and other cells that do) ?   There must be some kind of chemical generator, or battery, inside the cell.   6.  Since we assume that chemicals self-organised to create life,  and that chemicals inherently do not have desire or thought, but are simply reactions due to structure.      Should we not also assume that we (life) are not actually in any control, but just continuous chemical reactions dependent on our interaction with the environment (other chemicals)?      Thus the intelligence and inventions of the human race are really just matter, which is consolidated energy,  organizing itself and the other chemicals around it without any actual concern or direction.      7.  Does what i consider \"me\" even exist?    8. I swear I'm not stoned! ...am I?   There has to be something different in self-animated matter that is not present in non-animated matter (once living or not). I don't think it's just electricity or we could add just the right amount of electricity to dead matter, or other types, and make them animated. Perhaps charged particles from the sun that got through the magnetosphere happened onto some organic molecules which gave them an extra jolt or something?  IDK!

I get why the jokes are there, cause creators think it would be boring without them, but a lot of people would prefer it that way- i wish there was at least one channel that had the helpful animatics and that was all it was.
