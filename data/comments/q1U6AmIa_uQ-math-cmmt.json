Sometimes this classification is obvious without proceeding with this test.  A second derivative test at a stationary point that is either positive or negative, will conclude it as a local extreme point.   A positive second derivative concludes it as a local minimum, a negative second derivative concludes it as a local maximum.  A second derivative of zero is inconclusive.  You have to continue looking to the next even-order derivative, in order to infer whether the point is a local maximum or minimum.  The lowest order even derivative that is non-zero, will conclude it as either a local maximum or local minimum.
