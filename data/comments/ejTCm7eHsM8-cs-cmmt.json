In Direct Mapping every line no has it's multiple blocks that can be only reside in that specific cache line. But with Set Associative Mapping, cache lines within same set can reside other lines' blocks too where it cannot in Direct Mapping. Tag numbers a bit more in Set Associative due to P.A.S. Because they are a bit more in Set Associative, they reside in corresponding set but still in line within that set.
