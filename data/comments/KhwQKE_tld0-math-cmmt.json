[43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=2602) Comparison of integrals shows convergence  ---------------------------------  Detailed Summary for [Lec 36 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)  [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=0) L'Hopital's Rule and rates of growth were discussed in class. - L'Hopital's Rule has three hypotheses and a single conclusion. - The comparison of functions can be expressed through the notation 'f is a lot less than g.' - Rates of decay are discussed as the inverse of rates of growth. - Improper integrals will be discussed in the next class.  [07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=438) Understanding the convergence and divergence of integrals as x goes to infinity. - The integral from a to infinity of f(x) dx is defined as the limit as n goes to infinity of the ordinary definite integral up to some fixed, finite level. - The integral converges if the limit exists, and diverges if not. - The convergence or divergence of the integral has a geometric analog, which should always be considered. - The first example is the integral from 0 to infinity of e^ - kx dx, which converges to 1/k.  [13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=833) Understanding the limit of a function when k is positive - The limit only works when k is positive and the total area is finite. - When discussing limits, 'exists' means that it is a finite number. - In dealing with infinity, it is important to plug in infinity correctly. - The limit can be any number, not just a positive one. - The limit of a radioactive substance's decay in the limit is equal to the total number of particles. - Although T going to infinity is an idealization, it is still used in physics as it simplifies the problem.  [19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=1197) Infinitesimal is easier than finite numbers - The algebraic formulas are harder to compute than the infinitesimal ones - Integral from minus infinity to infinity of e^-x^2 dx equals the square root of pi, which is important in probability  [25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=1502) Fat tails in financial mathematics are a serious concern. - Fat tails refer to unlikely events that still happen sometimes. - Proper mathematical understanding is necessary to deal with fat tails.  [30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=1828) The integral from 1 to infinity / x^p diverges if p <= 1 and converges if p > 1. - Limit comparison is useful when you don't yet know the number and can make a comparison to something whose convergence properties you already understand. - If a function, f, is similar to a function, asymptotically the same as a function, g, as x goes to infinity, then the integral starting at some point out to infinity of f(x) dx and the other one, converge and diverge at the same time. - The tilde symbol means that f(x) / g(x) tends to 1. - The integral from 0 to infinity dx / the square root of x^2 + 10 resembles the square root of x^2, which is just x.  [37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=2228) Using the limit comparison method, we can easily decide whether an integral is finite or infinite. - Limit comparison method makes no difference whether the integral can be computed or not. - Comparison is made with similar integrals that are already known to be convergent or divergent. - The comparison is made at the end of the picture as x goes to infinity. - The method helps to avoid computing difficult integrals.  [43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhwQKE_tld0&t=2602) Comparison of integrals shows convergence - The integral from 0 to 1 of e^-x^2 is finite - The integral from 1 to infinity of 2e^-x dx is a convergent integral", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "KhwQKE_tld0", "cid": "UgxP8oYuETi4TM_7C_d4AaABAg", "comment": "pretty interesting to hear in min 25 about \"fat tails in finance and the morgage scandal\".
