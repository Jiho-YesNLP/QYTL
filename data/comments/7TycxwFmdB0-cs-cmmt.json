I got lucky this time because the creator of that class, the one who tough that Turing machine would be the best way to introduce basic logic concepts was a friendly man. He realized that a good student was going to fail because of the way his creation was used by other teachers. He lent me a box that he was keeping in his office for years. It contained each version of exam he wrote and the solution he presented to his students. I spent my evening and weekends revising all these documents.  I could see how the questions evolved over the years in order to confuse students who would cheat by memorizing the answers. Year after year, the questions were tweaked slightly so that new students could not blindly copy the answers from previous years. The net result was an incredible mess of convoluted wording. The original intent of learning from Turing machine general concepts was lost in all these trickeries.  I was the first to complete the exam and leave the class as I knew each questions, which kind of proof they expected beside giving the correct answer. Despite answering exactly like the creator of the class was doing, the lazy correctors marked this or that as incomplete... giving me barely enough to pass. I was happy to escape this nightmare.

Now, I won\u2019t just assert that, I\u2019ll prove it to you.  I will prove that although you might work till you drop,  you cannot tell if computation will stop.   For imagine we have a procedure called P  that for specified input permits you to see whether specified source code, with all of its faults, defines a routine that eventually halts.   You feed in your program, with suitable data,  and P gets to work, and a little while later  (in finite compute time) correctly infers whether infinite looping behavior occurs.   If there will be no looping, then P prints out \u2018Good.\u2019 That means work on this input will halt, as it should. But if it detects an unstoppable loop, then P reports \u2018Bad!\u2019 \u2014 which means you\u2019re in the soup.   Well, the truth is that P cannot possibly be,  because if you wrote it and gave it to me,  I could use it to set up a logical bind  that would shatter your reason and scramble your mind.   Here\u2019s the trick that I\u2019ll use \u2014 and it\u2019s simple to do.  I\u2019ll define a procedure, which I will call Q, that will use P\u2019s predictions of halting success  to stir up a terrible logical mess.   For a specified program, say A, one supplies, the first step of this program called Q I devise is to find out from P what\u2019s the right thing to say of the looping behavior of A run on A.   If P\u2019s answer is \u2018Bad!\u2019, Q will suddenly stop.  But otherwise, Q will go back to the top,  and start off again, looping endlessly back,  till the universe dies and turns frozen and black.   And this program called Q wouldn\u2019t stay on the shelf;  I would ask it to forecast its run on itself. When it reads its own source code, just what will it do?  What\u2019s the looping behavior of Q run on Q?   If P warns of infinite loops, Q will quit;  yet P is supposed to speak truly of it!  And if Q\u2019s going to quit, then P should say \u2018Good.\u2019 Which makes Q start to loop! (P denied that it would.)   No matter how P might perform, Q will scoop it:  Q uses P\u2019s output to make P look stupid. Whatever P says, it cannot predict Q:  P is right when it\u2019s wrong, and is false when it\u2019s true!   I\u2019ve created a paradox, neat as can be \u2014 and simply by using your putative P.  When you posited P you stepped into a snare;  Your assumption has led you right into my lair.   So where can this argument possibly go?  I don\u2019t have to tell you; I\u2019m sure you must know.

Let me again show you the flaws in your argument.  \"I'm recognizing that you can't expect something to give you perfect output with imperfect input.\"   Why are you even assuming this? H is a black box or an oracle, if you will, that can solve all inputs. You need to understand that H is stated explicitly to solve any input. Your not supposed to understand how it can, just that it can. Your use of \"imperfect\" input is utterly meaningless here. It's like your saying H can't exist because there are \"imperfect\" input it can't solve. QED.   \"A so called 'perfect' P can't exist because there is no correct answer. Likewise, there is no correct answer for H for the exact some reason: you haven't given it valid data to make that determination. \"  Again, you use \"valid\" here in an attempt to prove it's non-existence. But what is valid and invalid? For H, there is no difference. \"adsfasdf\" with input \"1232\" is a perfectly valid input for H. H will just return true because it never ran. In H's eyes, that the same as halting(because it is not forever running). Same applies to your program that requires infinitely recurring dependency.  You're obviously stuck on H being given input <P, w> that is unexpected, and then concluding that it can't be possible determine if the program P will halt on w or not.

The people at CrashCourse felt that the untimely ending of his life and work was worth mentioning, as well as many other people, does that really bother you so much? Why? Actually, how do you feel about the following: When people talk about, for example, basically any famous or achieved black person who lived during a time when segregation was in full force, they typically point out that they faced even more hardships due to their race. Does that bother you?  If it doesn't bother you, how is Turing's situation different? Discrimination ended his life and with it his ability to continue the work he loved, the fact that his country ended his life early for no justifiable reason is absolutely relevant to his work.  If it does bother you, then I don't know what to say. It's clear that discrimination affects people's work, if you cannot see that then I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.   In the end, nobody is forcing *you* to talk about his sexuality. You're in no way obligated to, and If you don't want to then don't. But don't say that others have no reason to mention it. And do not claim that \"everyone\" mentions it. Personally, I didn't even know about his sexuality until years after learning who he was and what he did.

And I've never once seen a discussion of Turing that didn't do this. It's possible I've been looking in the wrong places--but a web series on computer science, that has up till now discussed the field in the abstract, produced by a franchise that almost invariably minimizes superfluous biographical details of the people who enter into the stories of its various subject matter, would seem to be the place to look.  The difference between him and famous black people from the Civil Rights era and earlier? Well I may eventually be able to come up with a few exceptions, but every single one of the latter whom\u00a0I can think of off the top of my head--soldiers, writers, artists, inventors, scientists, industrialists, athletes, performers, religious leaders, political figures--directly addressed the African-American experience of their time with at least a significant portion of their work. So you can't discuss their professional legacies without referencing it, because the people in question deliberately tied those legacies into their racial identities.  Turing's work, on the other hand, had nothing to do with homosexuality. He never claimed it did, he never discussed his sexuality publicly at all. He may have been afraid to, and clearly he had good reason to be, if he was. But in this day and age when the social cost of coming out is much, much lower, lots of queer folk choose not to, because it's a private thing, none of your business. Conversely, it was possible for an openly gay Englishman of that generation to carry on with important academic work unmolested; John Maynard Keynes proved that.  Returning to that point of a person's work not necessarily reflecting their personal details, a better analogy than successful pre-Civil Rights black\u00a0people\u00a0might be Steven Hawking: Everyone knows he suffers from ALS, which makes his already-significant accomplishments all the more impressive. But scientific papers never mention this, and even popular science articles and videos rarely bring it up. Hell, even pop culture references like those seen on The Simpsons and Big Bang Theory show relative restraint in bringing it up, and when they do it's for comedy gags that are all in good fun.  Or take an even more famous ALS patient, Lou Gehrig. If you're focusing on his biography, you know it's going to have a\u00a0crappy ending. And his prodigious output was also cut short by something horrible. Had he been able to play into his forties, retiring as the all-time home run king was not beyond the realm of possibility for him. 600 home runs would have been highly likely, and 500 a certainty. Books and essays about baseball stats occasionally make a melancholy nod to this fact, but in the majority of cases they don't. Books about the man, or about the sports landscape in the late prewar years, devote a lot of attention to this, as do biopics like Pride of the Yankees. But discussions of his place in the record book rarely if ever go that way. When Ripken broke his consecutive games streak in 1995, I didn't hear a single commentator suggest that it was unfair to compare a healthy man's physical achievement to a terminally ill man's.

I don't think that's an accurate conclusion to draw from what I wrote. You can be responsible for doing something by playing a large role in doing it, i'm not nor would I be suggesting that anyone could be solely responsible. As a History student I don't believe any event or result is monocausal that events can be purely explained by the deeds of great men. Often this is a highly unhelpful way of reading history.   As regards those who are saying that we shouldn't mention his sexuality and focus on his achievements. i think not to do so would be to be doing a disservice to the historical audience. What ultimately is the point of writing history, even in this case the history of science. Minority representatives have been excluded and airbrushed too often in history writing. This exceptional man, in concert with others of great talent, did something that did save millions of lives. Collossus was his idea and he was the exceptional one, there is a good reason he is known as the father of modern computing and computer science. He certainly shortened the war and as a result he probably has saved more lives than anyone else (aside from people who discovered cures for diseases) in history.
