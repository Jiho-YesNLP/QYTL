The equation KK^-1=I can be broken down by individual columns of K^-1.  K times the first column of K^-1 gives you the first column of I, which is also how we're representing a discrete impulse at the topmost position.  K times the second column of K^-1 gives you the second column of I, which is how we represent a discrete impulse at the second discrete position.  And so on.  In other words, the columns of the inverse represent the response that this system would have to the columns of I, e.g. to discrete impulses placed at all of the possible locations.  Since the inverse is used to determine the response to ANY discrete vector, what this is saying is that you can decompose any discrete input into linear combinations of discrete impulses, and the response for that input will be the same linear combination of the columns of the inverse matrix.  This is linearity and the superposition principle.  To your second question, if instead of a 4x4 system we had a much large system, you would see that the diagonal entries in the middle of the matrix are larger, and they get smaller as you get to the top or bottom of the matrix.  K represents the fixed-fixed situation, so the endpoints are constrained.  Thus, if you put the load closer to one end, rather than in the middle, there is a limit to how much it can stretch the bar.  The stretch is maximum when you put the load in the middle. You could also pose yourself an interesting geometry problem: if you have two line segments, one starting at (0,0) and one ending at (1,0), and they meet at an intersection inside [0,1], and their slopes must differ by exactly 1, what location should the intersection have to maximize the height of the intersection?  The answer will be exactly at x=0.5.  Since the left slope is 1-a and the line runs until x=a, its height at its peak is a(1-a).  For what value of a is a(1-a) maximized?  The answer is a=0.5.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "h5KiY9lvHc4", "cid": "Ugz1S0gLgEwHcX24f6h4AaABAg", "comment": "third", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
