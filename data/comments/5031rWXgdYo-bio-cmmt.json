The tongue and the nose bouth analyze taste. As far as I know at least, I am not an expert in the field. But they have different activation thresholds. So, if let's say I taste a very small amount of a substance, let's say a lemon, it is possible for one to get activated and the other not to get activated. If this happens, the brain recieves two different responses for the same stimulus. And in my personal experience, this acts like a drug. The brain gets confused and I get dizzy, cheerful, it depend on the substances. But all the substances I am talking about are food, not drugs. For example I squeez maybe 0.1 grams of lemon in a lidzen tea and when I drink it I feel like I am drunk. Something like that. In order to prepare the drink, I simply add very little lemon to the tea and smell it. I feel some sort of a sting in my nose and I imediatly start feeling the effects. I don't really know how this works exactly from a neuroligical perspective. I think of it like I said, two different inputs for the same stimuls and the brain gets in overdrive. I am curious if anyone tried experimenting with something like this. It's 100% legal, since it's about food, not drugs.

I was pondering one day over \"Knowledge\" and realised that knowledge is not a PERCEPTION... I thought deeply over how it is stored.. I realised that it is STORED in the form of CURRENT SIGNALS in the Memory Zones present in our Brain...This kind of STORAGE can be compared to a phenomena in which a wire has current in it with its ends isolated and not connected to any voltage or current source!! I know it is IMPOSSIBLE for Humans to achieve storage of current signals but it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE for Almighty, the Creator of our Brain....I realised that the entire DOMAIN of KNOWLEDGE represented by current signals is already present in our Brain but the CONNECTIONS OF Memory Zones(which stores these current signals) TO the MEMORY ACCESS UNIT of Brain have NOT BEEN DONE! When we Humans take EFFORTS to GAIN knowledge, the memory zones carrying current signals(corresponding to that knowledge) gets CONNECTED to the Memory Access Unit...This is the mechanism of gaining knowledge....Thinking more on this, I realised that REVERSE should also be achievable! Reverse here means that we take EFFORTS to CONNECT the Memory Zones (storing the current signals) to the Memory Access unit and as a result we gain the entire DOMAIN of KNOWLEDGE...\u00a0  Above written lines are results of pondering and I believe that by pondering, we can know things which we do not know... may be pondering leads to formation of connections! Almighty knows best...  I wrote this because someone reading this comment may be in a better position to do research on Brain and explore the world of knowledge which Almighty has blessed us with...   I would like to share one of the verse of Quran, chapter 2, verse 31 which says: Allah replied, \u201cI know what you do not know.\u201d After this he taught Adam the names of all things. Then He set these before the angels and asked, \u201cTell Me the names of these things, if you are right (in thinking that the appointment of a vicegerent will cause disorder)\u201d.   The above verse clarifies that Allah taught Adam the names of everything, their proper names, the names of their characteristics, and what they do...I believe that all Humans have been blessed with knowledge stored in the form of current signals....Just imagine if humanity gain this entire realm of knowledge given by Almighty...We will get to know about everything, its characteristics, properties, usage...My logic says that we can find CURE OF ALL DISEASES once we have this knowledge...we will get to know the PURPOSE OF CREATION, we will get to know who our Creator is!

Good catch up lesson. If viewers are just here for Prof. Sapolsky and think about skipping this one: if you learned about brain function, specifically neurons and synapse function, you should be able to skip the second part (by Anthony Chung-Ming Ng) as he is mostly talking about well known chemical neurotransmitters being introduced in future lectures.  The first part of the catch-up (by Nathan Woodling) goes into the specific names and functions of the neuron's different cell parts, which might be helpful, so I recommend at least giving it a go if you are not well versed in that (put on quicker playback speed, if you are somewhat familiar).

If I were having this lecture taped for Web viewers on YouTube, I'd made sure of having the exact reverse getting done, that is, to bring down the picture of the brain at eye level and move the stupid chicken upstairs. I cannot guess why this is not done for us, YouTube viewers. One cannot deny that having the picture in view would be a plus for us, the intended audience for this video. It would reinforce our hippocampus memory of the picture, and sharpen our interest in the whole presentation.\u00a0 If there is a subtle reason (and I suspect there must be one, we're dealing with super-bright brains here, after all) for this unusual method of delivering a taped lecture discussing a  key picture kept from view, I don't get it. Perhaps, it's some pretentious imitation of a Shxperian drama, where a major action is described, but never acted on the stage. But again, I'm just guessing, you see, I'm just a pretty average student. From another angle, coming from a top university famed for its super-bright minds, it's quite comical.

Leave it to the attending brain  as long the  brain is not helpless hopefully,  autonomous and can make a choice by itself.  A big drawback of this lecture: too less picture of the stuff which should be presented in a nicely modern art: listening through the acoustic  pathways is one modality of receiving information. Nothing else under heaven if not the beautiful brain is a multimodality \"machine\" with more than one receiver channel. From a teaching point of view I would suggest speaking is less than visualizing. A picture is more than thousand words should be regarded as a premise in teaching neuroscience and of course in other learning fields.

In general, a positive ion like sodium ion or potassium ion are atoms which have lost an electron or two, and by losing a negative charge now have a positive charge. A negative ion is NOT just some electrons, it is an atom which has GAINED one or more electrons.   The Na/K pump is a complex protein molecule. Here's a pretty good video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPFKDdWlCg (There's a common error in it, however: there aren't 3 receptor sites on one side and 2 on the other, although the result is as if there were, 3 Na out, 2 K in. There's really two sites which accept only Na, one site which accepts only K, and one site which in differing configurations (pumping out or pumping in) can alternatively accept either Na or K.)  What is being sent from one neuron to another received by the dendrites are neurotransmitters , which are chemical messengers released by the axon terminals of the presynaptic neuron. Those neurotransmitters are released as a consequence of the presynaptic neuron having had an impulse, an 'action potential', sent along its axon to the axon terminals, which causes the release of the neurotransmitters at the axon terminal into the synapse where they diffuse very quickly over to the receptor sites on the dendrites.   The point of all this signalling is that the brain is made up of neurons (as well as glial helper cells) and in order for the brain to process sensory information (as well as cognitive events like thinking), there must be some opportunity for data, in the form of signals , to be processed , and that's what the movement of signals both in the neuron via the action potential and between neurons via the sending of neurotransmitters between neurons allows for. In other words, it's so information can be processed, therefore information/signals must move.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "Ugzp1_JUt56vOb6kX4d4AaABAg", "comment": "positive chatge.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgwjRtYoH8pIB3Yinht4AaABAg", "comment": "1126", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgwjwH0_av33Ax_-SKx4AaABAg", "comment": "\ud83d\ude42", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgxESS9c6EQVmC8A4994AaABAg", "comment": "\"Dope A.

How does the energy signal 'know' where to flow?  Obviously it does, but how exactly does it do it?  For example, spread the brain out like a map.  The towns and cities represent the brain cells and the roads and highways represent the interconnections between those brain cells.  A vehicle traveling between one or more towns and/or cities represents a coherent thought.  How exactly does the 'unconscious' vehicle 'know' what path to take to complete a specific journey?   A higher intelligence would have to tell the unconscious vehicle what path to take to complete a specific journey.  But, that is a 'specific journey' or coherent thought in and of itself.  So, how exactly does our brain think a coherent thought before it thinks that coherent thought?  How exactly do thoughts think?  What is the specific 'higher intelligence' that controls the 'unconscious vehicle' or energy signal to follow a certain path in the brain to achieve a specific journey or thought?  Consider also, that at every intersection or juncture, something would have to control the chemical flow between the neurons to have the energy signal flow a certain way.   I once heard it said that as the energy flows in the brain, it strengthens that connection, kind of like water flowing down a hill due to gravity.  But then, why isn't the brain stuck on thinking only the same thought over and over and over again as each time that thought is thought, it would ingrain that thought deeper into the brain?  But obviously, that is not how reality appears to be.  Or at least from my side of my 'consciousness' that I am supposedly experiencing.  You might be experiencing reality differently than I, assuming of course that 'you' and 'I' even actually exist.  It's possible that only 'I' exist and you all are just a figment of my imagination.  I don't perceive reality to be that way, but then again, how could I ever truly know for sure?  And for 'you', do 'I' even actually exist or am 'I' just a figment of your imagination?  Or then again, maybe there is a 'higher intelligence' imagining both of us imagining each other?   But also, 'if' there is a 'higher intelligence' behind the very thoughts I think, that thinks the very thoughts before I think them, then do I even have my own thoughts and own freewill?  How could I if I couldn't even think my own thoughts?  And if the 'higher intelligence' is a part of my own brain, (let's say my sub-conscious mind or even unconscious mind), then how exactly does it think thoughts before my conscious mind thinks those thoughts?  And if those thoughts can already be thought before I consciously think them, then why even have a consciousness that can think thoughts?  Obviously, thoughts could be thought somehow, someway, without all those pesky neurons and interconnections getting in the way cluttering up the map.   So, how exactly do thoughts think?  Do I even think my own thoughts?  What exactly is the 'higher intelligence' that thinks my thoughts before 'I' think those thoughts?  Do 'I' even actually exist to even think my own thoughts?  If so, then how does it all work.  Tell me your thoughts, if in fact you actually exist and even actually have your own thoughts to think and could convey those thoughts to my thoughts.

By understanding those principles we can stack so many circuits on top of each other, like in a silicon chip, and build something like a central processing unit.  (CPU)  A CPU, like a brain, doesn't know what task is is supposed to achieve or how to achieve it, but since it follows predictable rules, predictable inputs will result in predictable outputs and that can be manipulated to process the input/outputs of a videogame or a complex piece of software.    Our brains are not totally like computers, there is no external operator who programs the inputs, nor an engineer who decides where to draw the circuits, but in the same way that the simple rules which determine electron flow can be manipulated to give rise to complex, seemingly inteligent behaviour, our brains use predictable and simple rules at a cellular level to give rise to complex, seemingly intelligent behaviour.    A brain is infinitely more complex than a computer, but just like a comouter doesn't need to be aware of its internal architecture, a brain doesn't need awareness of its inner workings in order to regulate them and create complexity out of them.   The idea that neurons get stronger the more they are used doesn't always lead to humans learning positive behaviours to interact with the world around them.  One example of this is when you are stressed about taking a test, you can obssess over it for days and days, inevitably putting more stress on your brain and causing worse performance at your studies as a result.    If our brains were totally self aware, they would redirect those thoughts towards a posituve strategy such as reinforcing the required information in to itself to pass the test.  Sadly, our brains aren't that clever and often do things that we don't perhaps want them to.    How can we \"think\" such things?  Evidently our minds are aware that they are not aware of much of their own mechanics.    When being 'self aware' has so many frustrations and so few benefits (Awareness of your brain's patterns doesn't equate to an ability to change them to your will) one has to wonder if consciousness isn't an accidental byproduct of intelligence which will be left behind by whatever type of intelligence supersedes us in favour of a more unified mind with less inner conflicts.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgyZZbSSgYd3Z7wAEMh4AaABAg.8n6mCybnVt_9b5UAkPC1WL", "comment": "\u00a0@SineN0mine3\u00a0 Thank you for your response.

How exactly does the energy signal 'know' where and when to start, what path to take, and where and when to stop to form a single coherent thought?\r \r An analogy I utilize is to spread a brain out like a map.  Brain cells are represented by towns and cities, brain cell interconnections are represented by roads and highways, and the energy signal is represented by a vehicle traveling between one or more towns and/or cities.  A coherent thought is a coherent trip.\r \r How exactly does the vehicle 'know' where and when to start, what path to take, and where and when to stop to form a single coherent trip?  A higher intelligence has to tell it those things.  But, that is a coherent 'trip' (thought) in and of itself.\r \r So, how exactly does our brain think a thought before it consciously thinks that thought?  And if thoughts can be thought without consciously thinking thoughts, then what do we need to consciously think thoughts for?  Just to consciously think thoughts that are already thought?  What then of 'freewill' if we don't even consciously think our own thoughts?\r \r And then to further that situation, modern science claims that many different energy signals are starting at various places in the brain, take various pathways, and stop at different places, just to form a single coherent thought.  (With the analogy, many vehicles are starting at various places on the map, taking various routes, and stopping at various places, all together forming a single coherent 'trip'.)  And somehow it's all coordinated and can happen very quickly and very often.\r \r So, where do thoughts actually come from?

Do \"I\" even have freewill to even think these thoughts \"I\" am thinking about thoughts and type these thoughts to you here on this internet?\r \r Modern science also claims we have at least 3 brains:  The early or reptilian brain, the mid brain, and the later more developed brain.  So, are early parts of the brain thinking thoughts before the later parts of the brain consciously think those thoughts?  If reptiles can think thoughts, then couldn't the early part of our brain think thoughts, and somehow pass those thoughts on to later more developed parts of later brains?  Is our 'inner self' really just our  reptilian brain thinking the thoughts that we think we are thinking?  Are we all just later more evolved reptiles?

Where exactly do thoughts originally come from so our brain can consciously think those thoughts?\r \r So \"I\" am thinking about thoughts, if it is even \"I\" thinking the thoughts that \"I\" believe \"I\" am thinking about thoughts.

Imagine a 12 hour clock.\r b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.\r c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.\r (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)\r d. Direct a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.\r e. Do this with the em fields on and off.\r (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results, cancelling out the em modalities of the laser, thereby leaving behind the gravity modality.)\r f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.\r (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)\r (And note:  if done right, it's possible a mini gravitational black hole might form.  Be ready for it.  In addition, it's possible a neutrino might be formed before the black hole stage, the neutrino being a substance with a very high gravitational modality with very low 'em' modalities.)\r \r (An alternative to the above would be to direct 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)\r \r 'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done.\r 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what 'gravity' was not, which is still something in the scientific world.\r This test can speak for itself.  It will either be true, partly true, or not true at all.  It will either show what gravity truly is, might be, or is not.  Science still wins either way and moves forward.\r \r *  And note:  Whether my gravity test or another's, a gravitational black hole would have to be formed to prove the concept as being really true.  A gravitational black hole that 'if' self fed itself, could literally wipe out this Earth and all on it, possibly this solar system, possibly put a black hole in this section of our galaxy, and potentially even causing a ripple effect in this galaxy and surrounding universe.  But hey, if it does, no worries.  Nobody would be left to prosecute those who did so.  (Possibly famous last words:  \"Hey, it worked.  Ooooppppssss.................)\r \r But as NASA has already proven that low gravity conditions over a prolonged period of time is harmful to the human species, and large rotating space ships won't really work for space bases on planets and moons, those space bases probably being needed somewhere along the way out of this solar system and galaxy, we need to figure out what gravity truly is and see if we can generate artificial gravity so as to have smaller space ships and proper gravity conditions for space bases on planets and moons.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27.

First I have to say your analysis is pretty spot on. Clearly there are many different ways people try to get clean but unfortunately almost all of them follow the same guidelines. The line probably sounds familiar even to people that have never been through this and the phrase is \"you are powerless over your addiction\". I never understood how damaging that one line can be for so many people but at the same time it saves countless lives. Biggest problem with getting clean from anything is relapsing. This is everyone's nightmare because most people think it means you have to start completely over on day 1. When you're repeatedly told that it's not your fault because you're powerless it's like getting a free pass so when that inevitable relapse happens it helps to keep an already fragile psyche in tact. Science has come such a long way but we still can't seem to fully understand the brain so we're just told things that require faith without any explanation in a rehab setting. When I was told general statements about my brain or psyche without any physical evidence I just couldn't take it. I feel like saying you're powerless over an addiction is like breaking a leg and a doctor just tells you to have faith that it will heal itself and your powerless. So after 2 rehabs and Narcotics anonymous I just stopped all treatment of any kind. I started reading about the brain and watched countless hours of video about the brain and addiction.  I'm now over 4 years clean and couldn't have a better life. Ultimately I used will power and a ground up leaf substance called kratom. I would drink a cup of tea made with kratom every morning and night for about 6 months. Kratom is unfortunately now being slowly and quietly banned across the United States but that's a whole different problem. Feel free to ask if anyone has any questions. I assume people that are watching this video are not ex drug addicts like myself but hopefully potential doctors that may be able to solve this problem some day.", "votes": "36", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgxJeQLAcQarAbSgrnh4AaABAg.8ZVuS2oPhGf9B61a-cbOW6", "comment": "are you interested in neuroscience", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgxJeQLAcQarAbSgrnh4AaABAg.8ZVuS2oPhGf9BknBjC0AQt", "comment": "\u00a0@menwithven8114\u00a0 That was a really interesting read.

These lectures are a fascinating and helpful exercise to get back in mental shape after Cov-19,  (and all the disruptions  from its routine changes,  if anyone knows what I mean? )  It's been a rough ride \ud83d\ude2a but it's worth trying to heal on all levels,  virus or not.   \ud83d\ude0a  There are many comments on here about addiction,  not much about its after effects. ? What I find interesting is talking to others who have also taken their sobriety seriously.  Good work, everyone.  I mean that.  It is also truly profound how some forms of suggestion can work. Good or bad.  For example, I talked to an older man awhile ago that told me his chronic alcoholism had caused him severe liver damage.  He was pretty devastated by the diagnosis,  and almost couldn't speak. (He is a prior Marine veteran and knew PTSD symptoms all too well but couldn't figure out what to do. ) He told me he was terrified at his diagnosis.  After listening to him for awhile, I asked him what he knew about the liver. He said he knew basically that once damaged, there was nothing he could do  He was,  in essence, grieving. Hard.  I reassured him that the liver is an amazing and wonderful organ but also one that can get better...IF HE STOPPED DRINKING. His scared demeanor changed. No one told him that. He thought he was dying right then.  That conversation was almost 20 years ago,  and he is still sober.  His memory has also improved and he laughs more. His health is still in need of treatments but he is able to function well enough to live independently.    The mind ( brain)  is an amazing \"organ\" as well.   That's why I still use it.

And that\u2019s the thing, they both seek \u201ctruth\u201d but their \u201dtruths\u201d are not congruent. That\u2019s also why there can be different religions simultaneously and still give them, the believers, the right truth. But still everything else you said, I stand behind that.  My perception might change, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m only 18 but that\u2019s my spin on things.

How does the energy signal 'know' where to flow?  Obviously it does, but how exactly does it do it?  For example, spread the brain out like a map.  The towns and cities represent the brain cells and the roads and highways represent the interconnections between those brain cells.  A vehicle traveling between one or more towns and/or cities represents a coherent thought.  How exactly does the 'unconscious' vehicle 'know' what path to take to complete a specific journey?\r \r \r A higher intelligence would have to tell the unconscious vehicle what path to take to complete a specific journey.  But, that is a 'specific journey' or coherent thought in and of itself.  So, how exactly does our brain think a coherent thought before it thinks that coherent thought?  How exactly do thoughts think?  What is the specific 'higher intelligence' that controls the 'unconscious vehicle' or energy signal to follow a certain path in the brain to achieve a specific journey or thought?  Consider also, that at every intersection or juncture, something would have to control the chemical flow between the neurons to have the energy signal flow a certain way.\r \r \r I once heard it said that as the energy flows in the brain, it strengthens that connection, kind of like water flowing down a hill due to gravity.  But then, why isn't the brain stuck on thinking only the same thought over and over and over again as each time that thought is thought, it would ingrain that thought deeper into the brain?  But obviously, that is not how reality appears to be.  Or at least from my side of my 'consciousness' that I am supposedly experiencing.  You might be experiencing reality differently than I, assuming of course that 'you' and 'I' even actually exist.  It's possible that only 'I' exist and you all are just a figment of my imagination.  I don't perceive reality to be that way, but then again, how could I ever truly know for sure?  And for 'you', do 'I' even actually exist or am 'I' just a figment of your imagination?  Or then again, maybe there is a 'higher intelligence' imagining both of us imagining each other?\r \r \r But also, 'if' there is a 'higher intelligence' behind the very thoughts I think, that thinks the very thoughts before I think them, then do I even have my own thoughts and own freewill?  How could I if I couldn't even think my own thoughts?  And if the 'higher intelligence' is a part of my own brain, (let's say my sub-conscious mind or even unconscious mind), then how exactly does it think thoughts before my conscious mind thinks those thoughts?  And if those thoughts can already be thought before I consciously think them, then why even have a consciousness that can think thoughts?  Obviously, thoughts could be thought somehow, someway, without all those pesky neurons and interconnections getting in the way cluttering up the map.\r \r \r So, how exactly do thoughts think?  Do I even think my own thoughts?  What exactly is the 'higher intelligence' that thinks my thoughts before 'I' think those thoughts?  Do 'I' even actually exist to even think my own thoughts?  If so, then how does it all work.  Tell me your thoughts, if in fact you actually exist and even actually have your own thoughts to think and could convey those thoughts to my thoughts.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.\r   Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.\r \r a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.\r b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.\r c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.\r (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)\r d.

I have tried to tell people in speaking about brain function, that the brain is the body. Every sense, every motor action is the brain acting.However, neuronal sensing is not limited to the body - sound, light, , molecules that olfactory and vomeronasal  catchers  influence action potentials, and even the wind blowing your hair, make your brain  extend out to your sight limits and beyond. Nothing occurs within your cellular world is unknown to your brain, so they - cells - transmit as well, if only through their numbers or chemical output. Not different than what a terminal button does.  Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are even produced (the molecules have other uses) by bacteria (gut bacteria is a relatively new area of study. Serotonin is just one group) and plants, as those who smoke any substance found. It (drug use) was a source for MANY neurotransmitter discoveries, although the use was largely of analogues.   Alcohol affects some receptors, so it also makes you cease production of enough of your own, and creates a kind of desire for connection with it, so, some of your brains also include bottled crap way out there in your environment. (people drink alcohol to forget, and they generally get their wish, though far more permanently than they intended. consistent use of just about any exogenous neurotransmitter analogue pretty much dumbs down the brain - after all a joke about alcohol having to do with its inhabiting glutamate and GABA receptors, is that you think VERY clearly about Nothing - all puns intended.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UghN1KyGcj2XcXgCoAEC.8-u6fUj5F1L9b5LxRdgeAO", "comment": "\u00a0@briseboy\u00a0 Every statement ever made about the importance of the brain was created by a brain, so you should always take that assertion with a grain of salt.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UggMWXeNUzyKO3gCoAEC", "comment": "49:28 or a bit later, i thought he was going to say \"or we can do it to get fucked up\"", "votes": "6", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UghePnPs8ULpk3gCoAEC", "comment": "First half very good, second part me no like!\u00a0", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgimBCNaSgl2xXgCoAEC", "comment": "I want to have a beer with this guy.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "Ugg6bbx9ER-GWXgCoAEC", "comment": "Great lecture in general, specially the first part.. the second one though a little boring..i think the Phd student should has been more ''motivated'' .. \u00a0 \u00a0", "votes": "8", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgiusSqBVxZRaHgCoAEC", "comment": "What a way to ace a test nigga...now my beats can-do-that~", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UghyEyAbLQ8kWHgCoAEC", "comment": "does anybody know the textbook for this course?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "Ugg-sio0aDef5XgCoAEC", "comment": "I'm a big fan of the Glu-tang Clan.", "votes": "235", "replies": "7", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "Ugjho_xbL0__sngCoAEC", "comment": "Admit you came here just because you heard there's a cool new rap video at the end of the lecture", "votes": "31", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UgggPFSjslEM6ngCoAEC", "comment": "Such a wonderful lecture, but it's a pity that we cannot see most of the slides.\u00a0", "votes": "442", "replies": "6", "reply": false}, {"vid": "5031rWXgdYo", "cid": "UghZK-iX-cwtfHgCoAEC", "comment": "Hey Nathan great video mate!

A neuron connection is only 'intelligent' if it produces greater awareness and understanding in the brain it belongs to.  Random and insignficant connections would be of no benefit to a being's intelligence so measuring the number of neurons and/or connections seems like a tangential at best indication.    There are some parallels here to machine learning studies, more neurons or connections don't lead to good outcomes for neural nets when the training data is bad or the model for understanding it is flawed.    There's some interesting philosophical ground to cover in order to unite the concept of biological intelligence with AIs.  I imagine a brain which forms connections too indiscriminately would percieve the world like someone who has taken a heavy dose of hallucinogens, perhaps capable of extremely novel ideas, but rarely useful ones.
