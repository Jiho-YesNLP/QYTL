Ans. Main\u00a0memory size=128K* 32 =2^(10+7)\u00a0* 32  =2^17 * 32 From this we get, 1 word = 32 bits Therefore,  Main memory size=2^17 words Therefore, for P.A. we need 17 bits.  Cache can accommodate 2048 words. Therefore, Cache Size= 2^11 words  Given, 1 block has 4 words (i.e.2^2 words) Therefore,  Offset (or WORD) bits=2 bits Now,  No. of Cache lines= (Cache Size)/(Block or Line Size) =2^11/2^2 =2^9  Since it's a 2-way set associative cache, 1 set =2^1 lines Hence,  No. of Sets=(No. of cache lines)/(Set Size) =2^9/2^1 =2^8 Therefore, SET bits = 8  So,  TAG bits= P.A. bits - (SET bits + WORD bits) =17 - (8+2) =7 bits  Hence, TAG+SET+WORD = 7+8+2", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "KhAh6thw_TI", "cid": "Ugy5GVOIR7IWI12Usnp4AaABAg.9PSHSf1EDqh9QoBJszbAzC", "comment": "Thanks sir.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "KhAh6thw_TI", "cid": "Ugy5GVOIR7IWI12Usnp4AaABAg.9PSHSf1EDqhA-zkASenQCZ", "comment": "\u200b@nesoacademy  Thanks a lot sir for the consideration for a student :)\ud83c\udf89", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
