Let me just say this series is incredible and it truly makes every single new concept in math seem unimaginably easy. You'll think calculus and linear algebra are tough but by the end you'll treat them like they're 2+2=4, and it's all because of how well these videos explain them. Some other closing thoughts and information about the contents:  The 165 videos here reach up to about the second year in math university(mostly Analysis and later some cursory Vector Fields), and a lot of the latter-half lessons here lean more on the Applied Math side than Pure Math. This is probably intended and it's a good thing, considering all the related fields Dave specialises in. Meaning that the math you're going to learn in this series all have strong practical applications in Physics, Engineering, but also Computer Science, in case you wish to become a programmer. While not strictly necessary, and you can perfectly understand without, I might recommend knowing at least a bit about classical Physics once you reach the calculus lessons in math and beyond, although, if like most of the population you've went to school, you've probably had basic Physics classes and that alone is enough.  In any case, the math you learn here is going to be more or less all you need for most Physics or Engineering. Anything beyond will probably concern the very bleeding edge in contemporary math or physics, and is probably things I can't even begin to comprehend..", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "JbhBdOfMEPs", "cid": "UgzsAItPDNQmvBd3g5h4AaABAg", "comment": "Math is my weakness since kindergarten...

If not then how can I explain it perfectly. Nothing is something. How can something be nothing. Nothing = 0. 1 = something. So nothing is something is the same as 0 = 1. Is means the sale thing as the = sign. 1 is 1. 1 = 1. Nothing = something is nothing or nothing is something that say that this is this. Everything is the exact same thing. How. If everything is not 1. Then evrytime is 0 1. Everything is the same everytime is 0 1. Is everything 0 1. So 0 * 1 = 0. So how can I write everything is 0 1. Is 0 1. I said it\u2019s the same. 0 1s. What does 0 1 really mean. It\u2019s means 1 1. How 0 = 1 number. And number is. If 0 is nothing then 0 not 0. 0 is my idea of nothing using something. How do you say what something is. 0 + 0. Nothing = nothing. 0 is 0. Nothing = nothing. 0 is nothing. So I used is and = tp describe mothering 5 times. 5 ways proving is = is. = is = because of 0:02 is isn\u2019t = then. Is =? Won\u2019t make sense. = is. So saying is =. Is another way of saying = =. Is is. If is isn\u2019t is them the whole word is means nothing. =? That tells me the same thing. As. 1? What? 1? Is.  =? Yeah 1 1 1. Is 1 = 1. Yeah the answer to math is 1. The answer? 1! How do o get to the answer. I use the sign =. I explain the answer using =. Explaining the answer. Using =. Answer has more than 1 then. I need to use = and then answer which is 1. = = =s it\u2019s =. Something = something is right. = is something as in the sign = and spmething are the same. Something is a word and = is a sign. Then if not = is not something. Yeah = is something  because = is not 0. Yeah 0 is not something. Anything other than 0 is understand by saying something. 0 is not =. I can say that 0 is something. Oh so they do mean the same thing. Yeah. Something = 1. So something is a word and also  more than 1 letter. Seperate right. Word and letter = 2 things. A word is 1. Yeah it\u2019s also 2. Yeah 1 = 2. Letter and word = 2. I\u2019m explaining what word by saying the t can be seen as 2. Yeah if it\u2019s a word there will only be 1 word. What is everything. 1! Everything is the same thing: what\u2019s the answer to everything. 1 evrythings a question then. No a question can be wrong. A question is something. Wrong is nothing. How? Everything has an answer. It\u2019s 1. Every question is amswered. There is no wrong. Why? Is wrong is not nothing. There must be wrong. Yeah then it\u2019s not all the same. Wrong is a word. A word is something. A word exists. It\u2019s a word. Yeah. A word. Wrong is a word. Is = is. Is wrong is. Not wrong isnt. Is is and amswers so is wrong is. Would be that is isnt is. The isnt replaces wrong is. Is isnt is = wrong. Because it isn\u2019t. It means that\u2019s something is not. Isnt means that it\u2019s not. So it\u2019s nothing. Yeah. Nothing nothing. Means 0. Wrong isn\u2019t right. Because wrong isn\u2019t  something. That says nothing right. Yeah. Wrong isn\u2019t right. Ahhh nothing. Yeah wrong isn\u2019t. Becuse if wrong isn\u2019t wrong.  Then how can I say that wrong is not isnt. Because if wrong is emptying then. I could say wrong is. If I put wrong where is would be. It has to always make sense. Isnt is wrong. Wrong = is so id be able to say isnt is wrong. Saying wrongs not it or wrongs not something makes sense. Sp wrongs 0. Wrongs it. What\u2019s any answer. Something. An answer can be nothing? Yeah 0 = 0. Yeah. So ypu said replace anything in any place and it\u2019s the same. Is 0 is. Yeah because 0 = 0. 0 is 0. 0 is? Yeah right? 0 is 0 is telling you number is number. No you\u2019re wrong. 0 means 0. Yeah 0 means nothing. 0. Nothing is nothing. Yeah. Is nothing is. Not because is isnt 0. Oh yeah that says  is nothing nothing. Nothing isn\u2019t. Otherwise nothing would be something that doesn\u2019t exist. Nothing is nothing. Word is word. Nothing is word. Yeah word is something and I see nothing. Not 0. 0 as is nothing: yeah. Nothing = word. I think nothing is not a word. I see nothing as 1 -1. Nothing - nothing is 0. 0 - 0 = 0 is correct in maths. In maths. How can nothing be maths. Tue number 0. How many numbers = 0. None! So 0 numbers. Is no numbers. Maths is all numbers. 0 is not a number. Maths doesn\u2019t contain 0. Maths is something how can something contain nothing. Yeah 1 contains 0. So how many 0 make 1. Doesn\u2019t make sense. No 0s in 1 Something in is the same as  1 contains spmething. Yeah not 0. That\u2019s because 0 is not maths. Maths = 1. If eveything ever is not explained. Then everything ever is not 1. Explained is the answer. 1 explained is evrything. Swapped. Explained is everything. Explained = evryytjimg. You can say not =. So evrything = explained. 1 evrything. 1 explained. Both 1. 1 explained doesn\u2019t make sense. There\u2019s no answer. 1 explained. This explained. I\u2019m this. I\u2019m 1. If I\u2019m 1 then I\u2019m explained. Yeah. I\u2019m explained because if I\u2019m not then explained the how can I say I\u2019m 1. That part of the explanation. Ahh so you are explained. Not fully. Yeah I\u2019m 1. I\u2019m non more than one. Fully explained. Fully 1. Only 1 explained. I\u2019m explained I\u2019m only 1. Yeah so if I\u2019m the only 1 explained is wrong. I\u2019m not explained. Because I\u2019m only 1 explained. Is that only 1. Im only 1 explained because if not I would be 1 as I said I\u2019m only 1. Explained!. Yeah only 1 sp that\u2019s correct explaining it.

I look forward to the series.  I already tutor math and understand it very well, but I'm eager to watch this series anyway to see how you explain each thing and if I might through the experience of watching this improve myself further.  By the way, I found this by reading someone's comment on Reddit. I think it was on the Math Education sub there.  If I'm going to be just a little picky, we still need to choose some axioms in order to decide whether or not certain things will be true (for example, the Continuum Hypothesis if we want to say there's no size of infinity between the natural numbers and the reals), and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem shows that no matter how many axioms we have in a consistent system there will always be at least one trye fact which cannot be proven true.  But I suppose true math is more about the implications that any particular set of axioms would have on what's true than it is about picking just one set of axioms and saying absolutely what is and isn't true. So, my pickiness in the previous paragraph is of no massive concern.  I guess I could get into our brains possibly incorrectly understanding logic as well and therefore us not being 100% confident in our inductive experience of proving mathematical truths. But I'm just splitting hairs at that point between us knowing objective truth and that objective truth \"existing\" (in some sense) without us having the means to have true 100% confidence in precisely what it is.  Our human brains being imperfect could also make the very words I'm saying flawed - even these! But there's not much point in going down that route because it's not very practical for us actually living our lives here on Earth.  Um... but yeah, math. Math is cool!

I'm in my 3rd year of studying Information Technology as an engineering student, and I've noticed that programming doesn't always require advanced math, mostly just the basics up to 10th grade level. However, I've become quite curious about how things work at a fundamental level. For instance, I'm fascinated by how compilers function, the inner workings of operating systems, and even how the keystrokes on a keyboard transform into the letters we see on the screen. To satisfy my curiosity and delve deeper into these questions, I've come to realize that a good understanding of mathematics is indeed essential. It's been an enjoyable journey of exploration for me!\" You will definitely excell in programmind.

Imagine if we had all the information in the world \u2013 we could accurately decide the best type of government or tastiest food. This relates to how we ask questions, which affects both math and other areas.\r \r Another thing I noticed is the way people emphasize math's importance by showing how it's used in various fields.

For context, I came from a neglectful and abusive home, so despite having extremely high test scores, I had a deep-rooted, distrusting, anti-authoritarian belief system. I only started to struggle when things became more advanced in the last year or 2 of high school, but by then I thought it was either something wrong with the math itself or with me as a person, not my bad habit of skipping steps I thought were \"useless busy work.\" Thanks to this series, I now see how easy it is to just do the work, and how that produces consistently correct results. :P", "votes": "12", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "JbhBdOfMEPs", "cid": "UgzNr3V2bcb3x5834eh4AaABAg", "comment": "Dave, you have no idea how much I appreciate your dedication to academia.

Get yourself an old-school exercise book and take good notes as you go, as you'll occasionally want to refer back to an old lesson, and you'll need to draw a lot of stuff, not just type.

Materialist Scientism is another in a long chain of monotheistic, religious twaddle to make us believe in some overarching, all-encompassing god--in Materialist Science, the god is Math.

There are some famous examples of these mathematical paradoxes that have been explained by famous YouTubers, such as Vsuace covering the Banach-Tarski paradox.  You're right to say mathematics produces completely inarguable answers, but then paradoxically, it creates an argument to an inarguable truth.  The universe refuses to give up its secrets easily...

I believe by you suggesting that mathematics is intrinsic to the universe you are suggesting that the universe follows our axioms, and all the things which are true or wrong according to our axioms. Do you think that we know exactly the axioms that the universe follows? If not then our maths is at least a tiny bit wrong for describing the universe perfectly, and certain things that are true in reality could be proven to be false mathematically. When this has happened in the past we've come up with new axioms to make the maths fit reality.   Also, according to Godel's incompleteness theorem, there are questions that can be asked within the axiomatic system, but can not be answered one way or the other. You can add another axiom that would make the question answerable, but by doing that you add more questions that can be asked, some of which still can't be answered. So to suggest that the universe follows mathematics, not the other way around, is to suggest that there are some things that the universe is undecided on.   Your whole argument for mathematics being  discovered and not invented seems to be that it makes sense, and that it's very effective. Well of course it makes sense and is effective, we made it to be useful and to describe very basic things around us, like counting, and we made very basic axioms such as \"A straight line is the shortest distance between two points\", and so on. These axioms are so basic and so obviously close to true in reality that what is true or false according to our axioms will almost always be exactly true in reality.  I'm not saying the universe doesn't follow certain patterns, what I'm saying is we invented maths to see those patterns more clearly, and that the universe doesn't follow those patterns as a result of maths.   I hope all that was a bit clearer, at least.

I agree that if you construct a circle in the real world, if you zoom in far enough, you would see something like \"pixels\" with dimensions equal to the planck length. So I am not arguing that math, and especially not geometry, has a one-to-one correspondence with reality. As the other of you also mentioned Godel, we know that this has been proven to be impossible with his incompleteness theorem as you say. But an object possesses gravitational influence that propagates spherically. Molecules, by virtue of the electromagnetic force, make complex geometrical shapes. These things simply exist, so math simply exists. Calculus is a set of symbols, and differentiation/integration are man-made constructs, but they correlate with the relationship between position/velocity/acceleration, which is innate. There is math in the universe, and there is math we make up. So I don't dispute much of what you are saying, I am simply defending that there are mathematical relationships inherent in the universe that any alien species would notice and use to arrive at the same conclusions about the universe that we have.

Are maths invented or discovered? The simple answer is no one knows yet. I would understand that you knowingly decided to take a shortcut with this video, considering that it's close enough not to confuse your audience. But saying maths are what you say they are is really odd. Reading you shows you didn't spend much time documenting yourself on the topic. Your arguments are intuitive and spontaneous but they are an uneducated guess. Your arguments aren't enough to make your case, they are just a na\u00efve take on the subject. You will see that there is no consensus at this point in time about what math \"is\". Definition are always partial and very different according to who you ask. For a reason. That's precisely because we know what maths are useful for, but not what maths are in the first place. A simple way to verify this is just to google and search the definition of maths. There isn't a consistent one. All definitions are partial as there always will be a branch of maths that doesn't fit the definition even though it's undoubtedly maths. Now go on youtube and type \"what is math\" and you'll see that all videos will just answer very differently. Many of them will digress very quickly ending up describing its usefulness, NOT its nature. And those, like you, who will try to define it will be challenged and their definitions will also be very opinionated. There is only one video which really tried to answer in a pragmatic way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNad3NvkgNg And if I acknowledge the effort, I must also say he is wrong because he has flaws in his reasoning too. He tried to be methodological but he couldn't prevent himself from injecting opinions in his reasoning, in a very subtle way. He concludes, for instance, that maths are deductive but he forgot that the axioms upon which are built maths are...inductive. He used the word reasoning in his definition which imply that maths are dependent of an intelligence to begin with (which isn't proven). At this point in time there is NO way one could define maths because there is something fundamental that isn't understood about maths yet. So, it's delusional to try to be accurate about something we fundamentally don't know. If there is no consensus about maths being invented or created, there can't be a consensus about its definition. Therefore your definition is as good but also as bad as any other's.
