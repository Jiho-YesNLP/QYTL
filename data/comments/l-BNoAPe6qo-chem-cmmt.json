For the ultimate honor he was buried in Westminster Abbey.\"  Made a knight....  knighted....  Your second article: \"In 1914 Ernest Rutherford was knighted\"  Third article: Yes, no mention of knighted is made in this one, that does not mean he wasn't however (lack of evidence is not proof of the lack of something, argument of ignorance). In your case you're trying to assume that \"he was not knighted\" is true, based on the lack of evidence stating he was knighted. Logical fallacy. Yes, we cannot assume either that he WAS knighted from the lack of evidence against it (i.e. since it doesn't directly say he wasn't knighted). But I'm not assuming he was knighted from this article alone, I'm assuming it from the various mentions in other articles... some of which are the articles you've listed.  Fourth article: \" In 1914 he was knighted. In 1931, he was elevated to the peerage, and granted the title Baron Rutherford of Nelson.\"  Fifth article: \"Rutherford was knighted in the 1914 New Year's honours list,\"  Sixth article: No mention, once again see third article description above.  Seventh article: \"Rutherford was knighted in the 1914 New Years Honours list and visited Australia and New Zealand for a scientific meeting and for a family reunion.\"  DId you even read these articles? I never said he wasn't a Lord. He was both, a Lord AND knighted. You are the one who refuses to accept he was knighted for some reason, despite giving 5 articles that literally say \"[Rutherford] was knighted\". I would find it hard to insist he wasn't knighted after all the articles I've seen (including the ones you've listed).  Also, clear he died due to a hernia type complication (once again stated in quite a few of even your example articles), or some reason related to the hernia (at least very likely).

I ignored the cited books and said \"articles\" for a reason. They were your easily view able website articles.... hence why I did not say: \"book\", I clearly said \"first article\". Although I suppose this clears up any confusion since it is now clear the 7 articles I was referring to were the website links at the end of your citation list.  There's plenty of evidence saying he was knighted, you've yet to show me any implying he wasn't. Again, lack of the phrase \"knighted\" does not mean he wasn't knighted, just like the lack of the phrase \"wasn't knighted\" does not imply he was. To do so would be silly. For example:  In your articles that don't directly state he was knighted I could argue: \"You article doesn't say he WASN'T KNIGHTED, therefore he must have been knighted, otherwise they would have said he wasn't.\" That is a logical fallacy. The equal is: \"Your article doesn't say he was knighted, therefore he wasn't knighted.\" That is a logical fallacy as well.  The proof I have is that plenty of articles state he was knighted. Unless you find me a nice link stating \"he wasn't knighted\" I can't really agree with you.

When they absorb enough of the energy that surpasses the amount of energy to leave the metal (the work function) they escape.This is called thermionic emission. The electrons are then attracted to the anode where they accelerate. This is important dependent on what you are using the electrons for. If you are using in an mass spectrometer for example, it is used to fire at atoms or molecules to ionise them (knock off an electron), this allows it to be eventually be detected by a computer and the mass of an atom or molecule can be found.  If the electrons weren't accelerated they would not have enough kinetic energy to knock off an electron off of another molecule. If they were accelerated too much (i.e the anode voltage is too high), the electron may knock off too many electrons and the detector may identify a much lighter element than it really is (As is detects using an mass/charge ratio).
