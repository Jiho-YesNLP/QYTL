Ever since the English language evolved the impersonal pronoun has been \u2018he\u2019.   As far as I am aware, this is also the case in all other languages.   With feminism in the latter half of the last century, the unspontaneous sounding \u2018she\u2019 was adopted in academic circles, especially in the humanities.   Thus, into a very simple, tiny word that is normally not even a stressed part of the sentence was insinuated an agenda.   Whatever the topic, one\u2019s mind had to be drawn to a gender issue.   However, language was being made to reflect a welcome change in society, one where men and women should have equal rights and responsibilities.   This necessarily involves shedding such former values governing inter-gender relations as \u2018sail before steam\u2019 (ladies first), and women taking care of the family, as no longer applicable.   It involves sharing 50/50 the cooking and cleaning, the restaurant bills, women inviting out men as well as the reverse, providing equally the necessary finances for supporting the family and having 50/50 custody over children in the case of divorce.  With this change, it has been common among male academics to use \u2018she\u2019 as an impersonal pronoun.  This really does sound contrived, but might be acceptable if women used \u2019he\u2019:  after all, the best relationships are based on putting one\u2019s partner before oneself.   However, women, in the legitimate pursuit of such change as allows them to assume an equally active role in society use \u2018she\u2019.   So perhaps it\u2019s best to regard a word that is less than a four letter word as being as inoffensive as it is short, and those silly male academics who emasculate themselves by remaining stuck to such old world values as \u2018ladies first in an age when women want to steam forwards should realise that it is at least as appropriate for men to use \u2018he\u2019 as it is for women to use \u2018she\u2019.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zTi3_l5h5PQ", "cid": "UgxxzDJHw06_igTlVWJ4AaABAg", "comment": "The only complaint I have with this entire series is that the tips in this EdTech episode for writing notes and following examples yourself would have been really useful earlier on!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zTi3_l5h5PQ", "cid": "UgxIyAX4NDo2ZS3w9gJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Does anyone know of any education software like the one described in this video, that would be online and free?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zTi3_l5h5PQ", "cid": "UgybiGub8ELZ_p9uVkx4AaABAg", "comment": "That's just pretentious.
