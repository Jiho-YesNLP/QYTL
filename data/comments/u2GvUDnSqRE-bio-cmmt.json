These interactions between histone tails and DNA may play critical roles in the formation of higher-order chromatin especially heterochromatin. Histone H1 is known to be enriched in heterochromatin and methylation of Histone 3 tail at Lysine 9 (H3K9 me)  is important for the interaction of heterochromatin protein complex in these region.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "u2GvUDnSqRE", "cid": "UgxN84x7Sno-UE3JpR94AaABAg.9W57Hi37e3s9XONAiwphTo", "comment": "Thanks a lot", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "u2GvUDnSqRE", "cid": "Ugxov4GGY0D-TjsrYzR4AaABAg.9UWYWDJE3EZ9YMKhGnVtoM", "comment": "Glad it was helpful!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "u2GvUDnSqRE", "cid": "UgyC2tC7j9IkJwgd5uV4AaABAg.9JNJl5xH9pd9K52WfFGD8Z", "comment": "I'm so glad!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
