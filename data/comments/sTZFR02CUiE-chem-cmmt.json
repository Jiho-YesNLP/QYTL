Whether or not your spatial coordinate system is orthogonal, the sub-orbitals will still be.  I'm not an expert (yet), but I suspect this mistake/oversimplification is rooted in the assumption that the sub-orbitals are axis-aligned at all.  Rather, I suspect that the fact of the orthogonality of the sub-orbitals is what allows them to be drawn in an axis-aligned way.. but the choice to align them to your coordinate axes is totally arbitrary.  If I were you, instead of calling the sub-orbitals  p_x, p_y and p_z,  I would call them  p_a, p_b and p_c,  noting that there exists some (unspecified) 3D rotation which will align them with x, y and z.
