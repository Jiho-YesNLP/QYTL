However\u00a0 \u00a0NH\u2083 which has Kb value 1.8\u00d710\u00af\u2075\u00ad i.e higher than it's conjugate acid i.e ka value of 0.556\u00d710\u00af\u2079. so even if we use big approximation we get the ff \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\ud83d\udd35Kb=10\u2074ka according to the above definition the value of NH\u2084 (conjugate acid) must be much larger than it's source base.
