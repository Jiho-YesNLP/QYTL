If the electron gets all of the photon energy, then the remaining kinetic energy is still reduced by the work function (which is basically just the electrostatic potential energy of the electrons inside the metal). At least that's the simplified theory. In practice there is also a thermodynamic component, which is why thermal emission is possible even without external sources of energy like in case of the photoelectric effect and then we can also lower the work function with an additional electrostatic field, which leads to field emission. And finally the work function can be greatly modified by surface contaminants, leading to both a suppression of emission and active emission centers.

Duality of Electromagnetic Waves.  Proofs: That electromagnetic particles travel in spiralling motions, rather than wave-form motions.   Visual Proof: Obtain and observe a common plasma ball in a darkened room, and you will see that the electromagnet tendrils are rope-like in nature and are comprised of spiralling photons of light that split and radiate outwards in a circular shape on hitting the inside of the glass .  As such this visual demonstration serves to confirm that as with the nature of all projectiles, electromagnetic particles of matter do not (and cannot) travel in an up and down (flat - two-dimensional) wave formation.  Physical Proof: Reference You Tube video Quantum Theory Made Easy [1] Copied and pasted here with a revision of text to simplify the explanation further.  1. All particles of matter possess spin therefore it follows that their outputs of radiation are delivered into the surrounding medium in a spinning motion, which is essentially the same motion as a bowler uses to spin a cricket ball through the surrounding medium of air.   2. Regarding the boy in the video who is creating a wave formation along a length of rope by moving his hand in an up and down motion, if he were instead to rotate the rope in a circular motion (you can use a rope to experience this for yourself) this rotational motion would cause the rope to take on a a spiralling motion along its length within the surrounding medium of air.  Insightful Proof: Since the advent of electron-microscopy we are all aware, what appears to us as to being solid matter, is made up of minuscule units of atoms, which consist mainly of a vast amount of surrounding space, relative to their infinitesimal nuclei and orbiting electrons.  Therefore, if we were able to use an electron microscope to scan the entire length of a rope when it is induced to form a spiralling motion, what we would be able to observe is that every atom and electron within and along the length of the rope is travelling in a spiralling formation.  Sum: Particles of matter do coalesce together to form into (retractile) spiralling coils of forwarding motion, in order to be able to able to travel through their surrounding medium.  (Authors note: Think in terms of a wood screw, there is an applied circular motion of leverage which causes the spiral of metal to retract itself through the wood and so travel into the wood in a forward motion of travel).    GENERAL THEORY: If a lift was taken into outer-space and a torch beam of light inside the lift was shone across it, the beam of light would bend under the force of the lifts acceleration.   The speed of light is 300, 000 kilometres per second  For the beam of light to bend - The acceleration applied to the lift would have to be faster than the speed of 300, 000 kilometres per second.   Which according to Einstein is impossible, because as he said nothing can travel faster than light?   Einstein also said \u201cThe photon is considered to be mass-less when at rest\u201d. But only according to Einstein, and both energy and matter are never at rest.   However Einstein did tell the truth on one occasion when he said,  \u201cIf the facts do not fit the theory change the facts.   A philosophy Einstein maintained all his life, as a disingenuous but cunning idiot, and an unmitigated compulsive liar.   Of which I am neither.   Open challenge to any so-called theoretical physicist (anyone) to disprove the proof I have provided that negates Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Gravity & Acceleration\u2026   Synopsis: ENERGY & MATTER  Energy: To quote from Mike Flynne\u2019s book \u201cInfinity In Your Pocket\u201d page 68;   Energy is a controversial topic among scientists. Everyone knows what energy does but no one seems to be certain what it is. Essentially there are two models used to describe the nature and behaviour of energy; the transformation model and the transference model.  Rather than rely upon two contradictory theoretical models, we will be relying upon knowledge which is commonly available, and make use of this to take a step by step approach toward understanding energy and matter.  Oxford English Dictionary (Abrv, OED)  OED: Energy: The capacity of matter or radiation to do work: The means of doing work by utilising matter or radiation.  OED: Matter, a physical substance in general as distinct from *mind and spirit*.    All things throughout the universe are made up of two primal things, physical matter and non-physical energy.  As such, matter could not do any work or exist without energy and energy could not do any work or exist without matter.  Physics: There must be an input of energy for there to be an output of energy.   The use of the words input and output determines that there is a vehicle of matter between the energy input and the energy output, and denotes as all matter is made up of particles, that particles of matter are intermediary transit vehicles of energy.  OED: Gravitation: A force of attraction between any particle of matter in the universe and any other\u201d.     It is the input of energy into particles of matter that serves to fuel their motions and to supply their outputs of radiation to do work, and to attract and gravitate toward one and any other particle of matter in the universe.     Quantum Energy And Matter   Every particle of matter of every celestial body throughout the universe requires an immediate and constant input of energy to fuel its motions and its outputs of radiant energy.    All celestial bodies are isolated within their immediate surrounding region of interstellar space, and as they, and all of the particles of matter that go into the makeup of their structures require an immediate and constant input of energy to fuel their motions and supply their outputs of radiation.    So it follows that it is their immediate surrounding region of interstellar space, which is supplying all of their structures energy requirements, and the energy requirements of every particle of matter that goes into their structures makeup.   And as such, this means that the energy incoming from their immediate surrounding region of interstellar space, is all-pervading as it fuels every single particle of their structures, and those of their centres of gravity.   Further confirmation that interstellar space is universally comprised of quantum (invisible) energy and quantum particles of matter.    Physics: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.   Space vehicles use of jet propulsion to travel through outer and interstellar space, however, propulsion could not take place without the presence of matter; because propulsion is reliant upon there being some form resistance present, for the propulsive factor to be converted into the power of thrust.   Sum   Universal (Interstellar) space is comprised of invisible quantum energy and invisible quantum particles of matter.  Universal quantum energy is the substance that fuels the motions of every particle of matter in the universe, and acts between any particle of matter and any other in the universe.   Energy is not matter (m)    Matter is not energy (e).    Energy does not equal mass,    Matter does equal mass.   Quantity of Energy + Matter combined, determines the power of their attractant force of gravitation, and their speed of acceleration relative to the same criteria in regard to another quantity of energy + matter combined (bodies and particles of matter)       OED: Matter, a physical substance in general as distinct from *mind and spirit*.  Energy is not physical in nature, therefore it is Metaphysical in nature.  Energy is not physical in nature, therefore it cannot be Any---Thing physical whatsoever.  Energy is not Any---Thing physical whatsoever, therefore energy exists universally in a permanent state of being No-Thing physical or visible.   Sum: The Universe is made up of some-thing called matter, and nothing called energy.

Synopsis: CENTRIPETAL ENERGY  OED: Centripetal Force moving or tending to move towards a centre (cf centrifugal) the force acting on a body causing it to move around a centre.   All particles, bodies, celestial bodies, and galaxies are made of matter and all rotate around their centres of gravitation, and all particles, bodies, celestial bodies, and galaxies receive an input of quantum energy and quantum particles from their immediate surrounding space.    So-called centripetal force is not a force it is an input of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter that is caused by the 360 degrees of rotational force that is being exerted from the centre of gravity of a rotating body.  E.G. The hammer of a hammer thrower, the faster the rotation of the hammer and chain around the centre of gravity of the hammer thrower, the greater is the input of quantum energy and the subsequent output of centrifugal force (Refer also to later section titled Magnetism and Electrical Production).  All particles and bodies of matter receive a centripetal input of quantum energy from their surrounding space, and generate a power of centrifugal force from their centres of gravity.    The greater the quantity of quantum energy input, the greater is the concentration of energy and quantum particles at a centre of gravity, and its subsequent output of centrifugal force.    Synopsis: CENTRIFUGAL - GYROSCOPIC FORCE  OED: Centrifugal force an apparent force that acts on a body moving about a centre.  OED: Centrifugal moving or tending to move away from a centre. A gyroscope without an input of rotational force to its disc will do nothing.   A gyroscope given an input of rotational force to its disc will stand fixed on its axis without any visible means of support.   A gyroscope given an input of rotational force to its disc will inertially resist being moved from its centrifugally imposed fixed site of rotation.     Mechanics   When a force of rotation is applied to the disc of a gyroscope and stood on end, the rotation of the disc prevents the *inward coming * and downward travelling quantum energy and quantum particles of matter (gravitons) from passing down through the disc, and on toward the Earth\u2019s magnetic core of gravity.  Given a continuous rotation to the disc, the input of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter, continue to build up within the centres of gravity of the atoms of the rotating disc.    The build-up of quantum energy within the disc is excessive to the normal energy requirements of the nucleons of the atoms of the disc, which causes the nucleons of the atoms to spin faster, and as a result the excess build-up of energy within the atoms is being continuously and centrifugally from the atoms throughout the disc.   Simultaneous with this process, the structures of atoms of the disc and their outputs of quantum energy and quantum particles are also being subjected to the power of centrifugal force, as they orbit around the central axis of the gyroscope (think in terms of a hammer-thrower) at high speed.   And the result of this secondary centrifugal force, the outputs of energy from the rotating nucleons of atoms of the disc are progressively passed on in a spiralling motion from one atom to another;  and outward, toward, and out from the rotating edge of the disc in the form of spiralling waves of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter.  This output of energy and spiralling quantum particles around and the edge of the rotating disc, In effect then serves to enlarge the size and area of the disc, as the quantum energy and of quantum particles of matter form an invisible halo of spiralling quantum particle waves around the edge of the rotating disc.    Given this scenario, and thinking in terms of the balancing act of a common seesaw, and that the halo of spiralling quantum particle waves are interacting with the down ward acting force of gravity.    So it is that this halo of quantum spiralling particle waves, in effect becomes a rim of gravitational leverage and balance around the edge of the gyroscopes disc.   As such: As the downward acting force of gravity is universally spread evenly over all surface areas, it is this levelling factor that serves to impose a level of balance to both the gyroscopes disc and its rim of gravitational leverage.    And hence as the disc of the gyroscope is forced to stay level, the body and the axis of the gyroscope are forced to stay vertical.  Synopsis: ORBITAL MECHANICS OF CELESTIAL BODIES  Reiteration   Universal (Interstellar) space is comprised of invisible quantum energy and invisible quantum particles of matter.  Universal quantum energy is the substance that fuels the motions of every particle of matter in the universe, and acts between any particle of matter and any other in the universe.  The Sun and star of our own solar system, is constantly drawing in quantum energy and quantum particles of matter from its surrounding interstellar space, and it is this input of energy and quantum particles of matter that serves to fuel its rotation, its nuclear reactions, and its centrifugal and gravitational imposed inertial position within the quantum energy and quantum particle medium of interstellar space.   Perhaps more simply put the emitted centrifugal energy and spiralling waves of electro-magnetized quantum particles of matter that are being emitted from the rotational equator of the Earth\u2019s sphere, coalesce together to form two hemispheres of gravitational magnetism which are interactive with the surrounding interstellar medium of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter.    And it is this interaction of the emitted spiralling waves of electro-magnetized quantum particles of matter, spread over the 45, 656000 degree surface of the Earths sphere, with the surrounding medium of interstellar space, that serves to keep the Earth\u2019s sphere inertially positioned and fixed within interstellar space.   THE PLANETS   Due to its great size and its great density of energy and matter, the Sun is able to exert a tremendous amount of centrifugal force and gravitational attraction towards its orbiting planets.    And it is this combination of outwardly exerted centrifugal force and counter inwardly attractant gravitational force (As with the nature of hammer-throwing) that enables it to simultaneously repel, restrain and maintain the orbital distances between its own centre of gravity and the centres of gravity of its surrounding planets.   However, due to it being a seething mass of volatile and fluctuating nuclear reactions and explosions, the Sun is not able to impose stable lateral trajectories of orbit for the planets orbiting around its volatile mass    And this where centrifugal force and its counter force gravitation once again comes into play, because as all of the planets are undergoing rotation around their own centres of gravity, so it is that they are able to inertially stabilize their lateral trajectories of orbit around the Sun.       And the distances between their centres of gravity, and the centres of gravity of their own orbiting moons and satellite bodies (Saturn being a prime example).  www.fromthecircletothesphere.net  Synopsis of Magnetism is continued as a reply to this comment", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_U6YamvF7BE", "cid": "Ugzdut6wEhb3AhIgWuJ4AaABAg.8llGsGxPTHH8llHB4TUOjY", "comment": "29/09/2018: SYNOPSIS MAGNETISM & ELECTRICAL PRODUCTIONl                                               Given two common bar magnets, if we try to bring two identical polarities together they will repel one another and refuse to meet.   If we try to bring two opposite polarities together they will attract pull together and are difficult to pull apart.   Nothing visible can be seen acting between the magnets; however as we live in this age of the sciences, we are aware that there is an electromagnetic spectrum of energy that lies below the level of our visual reception.   And given that there is no other agent that could serve to explain this invisible phenomenon, it can only be that of the electromagnetic energy existing below our level of our visual reception, that is acting between the two magnets.   Simplistically speaking, if we had two people at a distance apart and we wanted them to pull together we would have to give them a rope, and if we wanted them to push each other away to keep them apart, we would give them a solid pole.   However, if these two people were undernourished and near to starving, neither of these actions could take place, as they would not have enough energy to achieve either result, as there has to an energy intake for there to be an output of energetic activity.   As such, we have two magnets which we know have an input and an output of energy of electromagnetic spectrum, but unlike two people, who would need a solid rope or pole to pull together or to push away; all magnets exert their own electromagnetic force of energy output which will interact with any other magnets electromagnetic force of output.   Therefore we are left with the mechanistic puzzle, as to how two outputs of electromagnetic energy are able to interact in such a way as to achieve two different results.   Clues   Academic: We are told by physicists that the energy of electromagnetic spectrum travels in waves.   Experience: When we take two magnets and try to push them together several times, what we sense and experience is a sense of bounciness - springiness acting in between the two magnets (Please note, this is how magnetic suspension works in vehicles).     As such we have two pieces of information, a. Academic: The energy output is in the form of electromagnetic waves. B. Practical: The energy output is bouncy and springy in nature.   And based upon our own experiences in the practical world, we know that waves are not bouncy or springy, and they are not a force, they just go up and down as a result of what is happening with the forces above or below them.   Therefore the so-called waves cannot be waves because waves cannot exert a force of bounciness and springiness, as bounciness can only result from the springiness exerted by springs and coils.   As such, the electromagnetic energy of the electromagnetic spectrum that is being emitted from magnets is not in the form of waves; it is in the form of coils, which are the only mechanistic form that can exert a force and a sense of bounciness acting between two objects or two magnets.   Given this additional factor, it now becomes clear as to how the magnets are able to both attract and repulse one another.   When two identical poles of magnets are opposed to one another, then as with the nature of two common springs turning anti-clockwise to each other, their electromagnetic coils cannot intertwine and retract toward each other and come together to form a single double helix coil.   When two opposite poles of magnets are opposed to one another, then as with the nature of two common springs, turning clockwise to each other, the electromagnetic coils of the two magnets intertwine and retract toward each other.   And as the electromagnetic coils emitted from the magnets retract and come together and form a multiple number of double helix coils, so do the two magnets retract and come together to form the single body of a larger magnet.                            Magnetic Bodies & Electricity Production  The planet Earth is a bipolar magnetic body rotating around its magnetic core/centre of gravity at a speed of 1,000 miles per hour.   The Earth\u2019s continuous rotation and input of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter, enables its magnetic core to convert the quantum particles of matter into bipolar particles of electro-magnetism, and form them into the spiralling electro-magnetic wavelengths of gravitation, which go into the makeup of its surrounding magnetosphere.   Essentially and mechanistically speaking, this scenario is the same as that of a common permanent magnet which we use to produce electrical current.  To produce electricity we surround a magnets magnetic field with a conductive coil, and then rapidly rotate the magnet to increase the input and output of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter.    Within the atoms of the magnet the quantum particles of matter are combined into bipolar electromagnetic particles of matter, which are then formed into the spiralling electromagnetic wavelengths which go into the makeup of the magnets surrounding magnetic field (mini-magnetosphere).   Due to the rotation of the magnet and hence its magnetic field the electro-magnetized particles of quantum matter are captured and build up within the length of the conductive coil.    Where given their continuous input due to the continuous rotation of the magnet they are forced to combine and flow along the length of the conductive coil in the form of what we call electrical current.   And hypothetically speaking regarding the Earth\u2019s magnetic field relative to the magnetic field of a permanent magnet: If we could shrink the Earth down to the size of a common permanent magnet, and then place it within a conductive coil, the Earth would produce an electrical current within that conductive coil.   Note: Or orbiting satellite\u2019s serving the same purpose, and microwave technology to convert the electrical current into microwave energy to be transmitted down for re-conversion into common electrical power.     SYNOPSIS Gravity  Given that we have shown that it is an input of quantum energy and quantum particles of matter into the centre of gravity of the Earth's magnetic core, and the centre\u2019s of gravity of permanent magnets, that serve to create their magnetic fields.   And that it is quantum energy and quantum particles of matter that serves to create the gravitational attractions between all particles of matter in the universe, so it is that we can say that it is quantum energy and quantum particles of matter, that serve to create the force of gravity.  www.fromthecircletothesphere.net", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_U6YamvF7BE", "cid": "Ugzh4uf-Mpa4pqncdox4AaABAg.8k5xgX0cdT48wkSam2xfJ2", "comment": "ikr kaysons lessons got nothing over this", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_U6YamvF7BE", "cid": "UgwNKf96px5sN92oYLh4AaABAg.8am8r9xy_Hw8tE7Rv2euNZ", "comment": "where was that Asian girl?
