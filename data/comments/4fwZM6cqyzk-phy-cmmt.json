The object has a low mass. This means that the object will have a lower weight, and will thus need a smaller buoyant force to counteract it, thus making it easy for it to float.   2. The object has a high volume. In this case, if the same mass of the object were submerged in water, it would displace a larger amount of water, thus increasing the buoyant force acting upon the object (Archimedes Principle) and allowing it to float", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "4fwZM6cqyzk", "cid": "UgyEV5_-fdCDqW75bmF4AaABAg.9G4eawCIpqG9IjNoucSXnX", "comment": "\u00a0@angadkalra6769\u00a0 thank you", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "4fwZM6cqyzk", "cid": "UgyEV5_-fdCDqW75bmF4AaABAg.9G4eawCIpqG9YBpDJN-if8", "comment": "Ah cant understand", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
