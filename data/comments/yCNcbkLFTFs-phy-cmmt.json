The idealized model that was considered was the Black Body. (Max von Laue called the black body the \u201cKirchhoff vacuum.\u201d It was also called the \u201cultraviolet catastrophe\u201d; the first signs of the \u201cvacuum catastrophe\u201d)\r 2- In 1900, Max Planck solved the \u201cblack body\u201d problem by discovering the \u201cquantum of action of light - h\u201d. Particle (h) is not a hot particle emitted by stars. Particle (h) came from the vacuum, from the cosmic vacuum.\r 3- Einstein's second postulate states: In a vacuum, light propagates at a constant speed (c), which does not depend on the speed and radiation of the source or observer.\r 4. According to SRT, a quantum of light is not a solid particle.\r 5- According to quantum physics, a quantum of light has its own internal \u201cspin\u201d (linear or angular).\r 6- Light is an independent and free quantum particle. Its movement does not depend on the speed of the source or the observer. The actions of light do not depend on the opinions of physicists.\r #\r \"All these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me no nearer to the answer to the question \"What are light quanta?\".
