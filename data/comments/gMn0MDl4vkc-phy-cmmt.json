And that is Faraday's Law. The current is a result of the combination of an opposing Coulomb electric field and the applied field which is changing the current. The opposing Coulomb field is a result of polarization of the inductor by the non-Coulomb electric field. So, the current is a consequence of the resultant field of the applied field and the Coulomb electric field in the inductance coil and is determined using the governing relation in conductors J = \u03c3E_net. It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the formation of the Coulomb field when the current in an inductor is changed. Before learning Faraday's Law and its application to the operation of inductors, it will be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos: i. https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo and ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discusses topics on inductance and inductors in more detail using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of inductive reactance. It also describes with sequential diagrams how an inductor develops the induced emf. Textbook 4 shows how the current lags the voltage across the inductor by 90 degrees for sinusoidal input voltages using sequential diagrams.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gMn0MDl4vkc", "cid": "UgxsOkpNFN359Ibopxl4AaABAg", "comment": "thanks mate you really are awesome", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gMn0MDl4vkc", "cid": "UgwwLyCqsnxM-iwlsSZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Lex Friedman?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gMn0MDl4vkc", "cid": "UgzN7DRDm_vGdvUlEll4AaABAg", "comment": "The video is very helpful and easy to understand.
