If there are four bits for the exponent that means the maximum value is 15 and floor(15 / 2) = 7. Is my math correct here or am I missing something? For example, if the stored exponent value is exactly 15 then the result would be E - B = 15 - 7 = 8 and if the stored exponent value is 0 then the result would be E - B = 0 - 7 = -7; so the actual range would be -7 to 8?  EDIT: I suppose the way you are doing it the actual range would be -8 to 7, but which form would an IEEE754-like number follow?", "votes": "10", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BCSf8SzKYts", "cid": "Ugy9F4UymPrdsnjzoBt4AaABAg", "comment": "You are the reason why I started thinking on every concept \ud83d\ude0a..thanks you are my guru", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BCSf8SzKYts", "cid": "UgxHU21UI6gGmXc3s7x4AaABAg", "comment": "You make studying a lot easier by putting so much efforts in your videos", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BCSf8SzKYts", "cid": "Ugz9X_BjbdN2AV2et8l4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks for putting this much effort in making these videos", "votes": "8", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BCSf8SzKYts", "cid": "UgzXdJX-EkfFctsufI94AaABAg.A0IglKtNOn_A2ljC-7jdbx", "comment": "as I know bias is always positive though the exponent can be negative", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "BCSf8SzKYts", "cid": "Ugya2_paSnCzgMuhe6l4AaABAg.9qi8xIlLT31A5RARLOKoE6", "comment": "i think you might be right. can someone pls check", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
