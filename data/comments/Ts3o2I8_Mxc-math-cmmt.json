I am choosing here eigenvectors as output basis(w1, w2, w3 ....wm) because that is usually the basis of interest but it can be anything (even exactly the input basis). So if I want my new coordinate(d1, d2, d3,...dm) which is the same as a linear combination of eigenvectors with d's as corresponding coefficients.  d = A * c = (c1 * column_1) + (c2 * column_2) + ... + (cn * column_n)  Since we are doing linear transformation, we must know what my new coordinate looks like if I were to transform just v1, just v2 and so on. This is equivalent to saying I know what will (1,0,0,0..), (0,1,0,0,...)... will become by linear transformation into the output basis.  Thus we can say that  column_1 = coordinate when transforming v1 or (1,0,0,..) into output basis. Hence we can write this transformation as a linear combination of eigenvectors(my output basis) with coefficients as column_1(my new coordinates). Similarly, now I know what the remaining columns of A represent. Thus I know my matrix completely.  If you are with me till this point, then for any arbitrary c's we can get new d's into the output basis. as A*c = d.   Your question: what happened when the input basis isn't one element 1 and others 0 (standard basis)? So if I know my input and output basis and what my (1,0,0..), (0,1,0,..) and so on look like in new coordinate(output basis). I can just write these coordinates as columns of my matrix A and I can now find the transformation for any arbitrary c's.

The transformation matrix A transforms basis v1.... vn to T(v1).... T(vn). And each T(vi) is vi times the column i of matrix A. Since output basis is the same the input basis, it can be written as a linear combination of the basis w1 to wm where the cofficients are the entries of column i of A.
