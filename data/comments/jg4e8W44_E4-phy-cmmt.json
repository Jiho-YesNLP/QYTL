But, for example: when you write \"l\" like that, and describe the \"lever arm\" like that, and never make it clear that your \"l\" is no longer the \"lever arm\" when the force is at an angle, you throw people off. The lever arm is defined by the physics book as the line from the axis of rotation to the line of action (the force directional vector). If the force is at an angle, the \"lever arm\" or \"l\" is NOT going to be the line you drew. The \"r\" you drew for the angled example is the lever arm, NOT the \"r\" as in radius. Radius is fixed from the axis of rotation to where the origin of the force is applied, NOT some imaginary line out in space which intersects with the force vector. Therefore; the imaginary line you drew out into space to intersect with your force vector should have been labeled 'l' for \"lever arm\", and it was misleading that you chose to label it 'r' which is for the radius. I know this may seem minor to you but this is extremely misleading if someone attempts to apply this equation when different values are given (what if they get a question which states 'l' = some value? they would be screwed every time the force is at an angle!). I would have let this slide if you didnt have minor misleading mistakes in EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS THAT I HAVE SEEN FOR BOTH CHEM AND PHYSICS. I wasn't even 5 minutes into this video before you managed to screw this one up. I am wasting my time with this long angry comment because it is nothing in comparison to the hours of time I have wasted in confusion over the course of watching your videos.

Step 1: Get hollowed out cube. Step 2: Securely attach magnet to inner bottom of hollowed out cube. Step 3: Place a lever on inside bottom of cube behind the magnet that's securely attached to inside bottom of cube so that one side of the lever is pointing towards you and hanging over the magnet. Step 4: Attach a vertical bar to the top side of the part of the lever that is not hanging over magnet witch is securely attached to inner bottom of cube. Make sure the bar goes all the way up to the inner top of the cube barley touching it. Step 5: Securely attach a magnet to the side of the lever that is hanging over the magnet that is attached to the inner bottom of cube. Note: Magnets need to be facing each other with attracting poles N,S or S,N Note: The lever is going to have to be really close to the magnet on inner bottom of cube because of how close those magnetic fields need to be to interact. But not so close that magnets can touch. The magnet on top connected to lever is pulling the magnet on inner bottom of cube towards it and since the magnet on inner bottom of cube is connected to cube, this pulling force acts as a lifting force. Now at the same time the magnet on inner bottom of cube is pulling the magnet on top downwards BUT the magnet on top is connected to the lever so any downwards pulling force is being converted mechanically by the lever into upwards lifting force. Now if you know anything about magnets you now that there are magnets powerfull enough to lift far more weight then just there own. So essentialy this divice is exploiting the powerfull pulling force of magnets by mechanicaly transforming its magnetic pulling force into mechanical lifting force through the clever utilization of a lever, and walla stuff can be made to fly. Imagine if the magnets in this experiment where electro magnets so the ammount of electrical current going into them determined the ammount of lifting force that it would have. Now imagine this system being used as an attachment that could be placed under or ontop of vehicles to counter the weight of the vehicle and any cargo its carying. Now imagine\u00a0 if this was done with powerfull permanent magnets and turned sideways and placed in an electric generator and had enough strength to pass through the magnetic fields as it propelled itself forwards with its own magnetic pulling force.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Signed\u00a0\u00a0 Adam McKenzie Anderson  Extra Note: If anyone uses my ideas for none profitable means great I hope it helps but if they are used to gain profit in any way I want 25% of anything that comes out of it please. :)\u00a0 My EMail is starfire7654321@yahoo.com", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jg4e8W44_E4", "cid": "UgwED8jjBhH-dT4rHgd4AaABAg", "comment": "Is it always sin?", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jg4e8W44_E4", "cid": "UgwGSiBTm1QFlbhNE6V4AaABAg", "comment": "Your the best man ..
