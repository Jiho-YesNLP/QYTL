There are zeros where the graph does not cross the x-axis, the simplest example being f(x) = x^2 at the origin.  In general, whether the graph of a polynomial crosses the x-axis at a zero depends on what's called the \"multiplicity\" of the zero, which is the highest degree of the corresponding linear factor that divides the polynomial. Odd multiplicity, it will cross, otherwise nudge.

The short answer is no, this isn't true in general for degree greater than 3. The question then is, what are the conditions under which the graph of a general polynomial can be translated to the graph of an even or odd polynomial? The way to answer this would be to start with the most general polynomial, apply the horizontal translation, and then set the appropriate coefficients equal to zero to get a system of equations. We don't need to worry about a vertical translation because we can always just adjust the constant coefficient.\r \r For degree 5, let p(x) = (a_5)x^5 + (a_4)x^4 + (a_3)x^3 + (a_2)x^2 + (a_1)x + a_0. Substitute (x - x_0) for x to apply the horizontal translation. After expanding out, we need the x^4 and x^2 coefficients equal to zero. This makes x_0 = a_4/(5a_5) and a_2 = a_4(15a_3*a_5 - 4(a_4)^2)/(25(a_5)^2). For example, if we take a_3 = 3, a_4 = 1 and a_5 = 2, this forces a_2 = 43/50 and the horizontal translation is x_0 = 1/10. Simplifying with wolframalpha verifies that the x^4 and x^2 terms vanish.\r \r Similar conditions could be found for other degrees, although the higher the degree, the more equations and the algebra gets incredibly messy.\r \r Note that for degree 2, this is just the standard algebra topic of putting a quadratic function into so-called \"vertex form\". And the reason it always works for degree 3 is that the system of equations only has one equation, so we can just solve for x_0.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "dIY86WqvGjw", "cid": "UgxlWqZMzE_1utHBqMR4AaABAg.99BxB6B5NBI9buFczA28Aw", "comment": "Yes.  That just means that the point in time is before the instant in time when we've arbitrarily decided that time=0.  One example where you see this, is the BCE / CE notation for identifying years.

The de-facto year zero, would be what we call 1 BCE, and if you tried to use our modern number line to keep track of the years, all the numbers for the BCE years would be off by 1, such that 2 BCE would be the year -1.  If you are accustomed to these being called BC / AD, it still is the same calendar, just with names that are meant to be culturally neutral.
