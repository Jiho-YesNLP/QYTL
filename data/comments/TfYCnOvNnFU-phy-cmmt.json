It's more like characteristics. A wave can be a pulse or continuous, and a wave can be transverse or longitudinal. These are ways of describing waves. Gravitational waves can be thought of as falling within this set. Asking \"did you forget gravitational waves?\" is sort of, but not quite, like asking \"did you forget ocean waves?\".
