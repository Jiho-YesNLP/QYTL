Cheetahs are an example of a cat turning into something other than a cat.  They are the only living species of cat that don't have a cutaneous sheath around their claws.   Imagine that you came up with a list of all the characteristics that an animal has to have in order to be 100% cat.  Let's say that having a cutaneous sheath is one of those characteristics.  Just to make the math easy, let's say that your list contains 20 characteristics and that the cheetah has the other 19 characteristics.  Wouldn't that make cheetahs only 95% cat?  Now, all cats belong to the family felidae.  Since cheetahs arent 100% cat, do they really belong to the family felidae?  Personally, I think the cut off point should be at least 50%... anything at least 50% cat belongs to the family felidae.  However, it's arbitrary.   A lot of people don't know this, but the species taxon is the only taxon that is found in nature... everything else, including the family taxon, are man-made.  I can't overestimate how important it is for you to understand and accept that last sentence.  Think about it in order to understand it's implications. None of the species of cat alive today are 100% cat unless you simply define one of the species as being 100% cat.  It's your right to do so, since again, it's totally man-made.  But as soon as you define one species as being 100% cat then that automatically means that none of the others are 100% cat.   To make matters worse, some of those 20 characteristics that cats have may be subjective and not completely black and white.  For example, let's say that being agile was one of your 20 characteristics.  There are over 40 species of cats still alive today.  Surely some of them are more agile than others. What if the cheetah is only 80% agile?  Wouldn't that bring down it's cat percentage down to 94% (5 x .80 = 4)?  And surely, if you believe in speciation, in a few hundred thousand years a new species can arise from the cheetah that only has 18 characteristics.  So it's even less of a cat than the cheetah and even closer to that 50% cut off point that I previously mentioned.   Now, some people will object by saying that a cutaneous sheath shouldn't be necessary in order for an animal to be considered a cat.  But again, it's a man-made list, and I'm a man, so I can make that decision if I want.  If you don't like my list, then you can certainly make your own list, but surely, if your list is a good list, any future species can lose one or more characteristics until they are less than 50% of whatever animal you are talking about.  In fact, depending on what characteristics are on your list, it's even possible that some species of cats are already less than 50% and don't actually belong in the family felidae.  I mean, it's not as though taxonomists are gods and can't make mistakes.  Perhaps the cheetah currently isn't a cat.  I'm not saying that it isn't at least 50% cat; I'm saying that I don't know and neither do you.

People usually picture two different but related species meeting each other then trying to mate with each other. There are various physical, environmental, as well as behavioral reasons this does not occur, even among closely related organisms that are different species. Sometimes the song and/or dance is just not right. This happens in allopatric speciation, when two related organisms live in overlapping areas but do not interbreed. They need not be incapable in the sense of being unable to produce fertile offspring, or the sexual apparatus does not match, but incapable under naturally normal circumstances. \"A species is often defined as a group of individuals that actually or potentially interbreed in nature. In this sense, a species is the biggest gene pool possible under natural conditions.\" ... \"That definition of a species might seem cut and dried, but it is not \u2014 in nature, there are lots of places where it is difficult to apply this definition.

This is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution but ultimately taxonomy as well. Besides the fact that you used terms with no scientific definition, I'll do my best to explain this. First off, \"kind\" refers to nothing. It is not a scientific term, it is not clear what this term describes, and it therefore should not be used in this context. Nevertheless, organisms never evolve out of their respective taxa. A tiger is a feliforme, but neither its ancestors nor its descendants have stopped or will stop being mammals. In other words, every organism in the Tigers evolutionary lineage both past and future will never be a \"completely different kind of animal\". But again, we have undefined terms. What exactly is a \"completely different kind of animals\"? Even a Tiger and a Crocodile share characteristics.  \"As you said, a chihuahua could still breed with a wolfhound(not that that would happen, but they COULD produce fertile offspring) so why is it that humans cannot breed with chimps or bonobos?\"  The potential for two isolated populations to produce fertile offspring is determined by their chromosomal relationship and the recency of their divergence. Chihuahuas and wolfhounds share the same number of chromosomes and their divergence was relatively recently. While it is possible for two organisms from populations with varying pairs of chromosomes to produce the occasional fertile offspring (30 documented cases of fertile mules in the last few centuries), it is a rarity and is not the only determining factor nor the most important. African wild dogs, for instance, share 78 chromosomes with wolves, domesticated dogs, coyotes, etc... but cannot interbreed with any. To your point, the simple fact is that we don't know if humans can interbreed with bonobos or chimps, nobody has ever really tried besides a deranged soviet scientist and it's not clear if his methods were concrete. What does it matter anyway? Just because we share an evolutionary relationship with these two species doesn't mean we must be capable of interbreeding.  \"And as far as evolution happening at an imperceptibly slow pace, we should still be able to see evolution happening on a cellular level at least every 20 years.

There is evidence that evolution is a thing. We have the fossil record which can be used to look at earlier species, the chemical composition of organisms (I'm going with organisms here because animals only applies to those organisms within kingdom Animalia, but does not include bacteria, protists, and the like) which can be compared to see how similar it is across species, homologous structures can be used to compare similarities and differences between species, geographic distributions of related species, and the recorded genetic change in organisms over a span of several generations. (source: http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm) So speciation. First we need to define what a species is. There is still some debate over what exactly a species is, but the most accepted definition is: A group of actually or potentially interbreeding organisms whose offspring will produce fertile offspring. Pretty much the babies can make babies. Once speciation occurs the two species generally cannot reproduce together because of various barriers. The barriers may be that their genetic code is too different to go through mitosis and meiosis without serious problems, or they reproduce differently. For example, we (humans) cannot reproduce with robins because the reproduction methods are different. Humans have sexual intercourse which involves penetration while birds have sexual intercourse but with no penetration (the males actually give females sacks of sperm which the females place inside a canal of sorts). Since the reproduction methods are different, humans could not reproduce with birds. There's also the issue of size: Humans are much bigger than birds. Now, species can actually recombine into one species (which is a totally different form of speciation) and sometimes two species can create hybrids. Mostly the hybrids are sterile and very compromised in terms of health. To sum up species can't reproduce with each other because of behavioral differences, genetic differences, reproduction differences, parts don't match, or geographic isolation. Now, I do agree with you on the dog breeding example. It can't really be used to prove speciation, but it is a handy example of how variation can occur and how selection (in this case artificial selection) can happen. We have actually observed evolution in action with fruit flies and organisms with sort generation periods. With fruit flies we can watch speciation happen because a generation period is relatively short and they produce lots of offspring. Since generation period is short we can observe a genetic change as it passes through the generations in a small period of time, say 10 generations in a week. That's enough time to see how the trait affects the adaption of the organism to the environment. This is, of course, an example of artificial selection. The part of evolution that takes million of years is the change in whole kingdoms and the bigger classifications of organisms (domain, phylum, kingdom, class). Sometimes speciation takes million of years because of environmental conditions (environment refers to anything that affects the organisms. That is ecosystem, other organisms, weather patterns, food, etc) fluctuating quite a bit. Scientists have lots of evidence of evolution. It may be called a theory, but in science a theory is when a hypothesis has enough evidence to be considered fact and thus other hypotheses are based off of it. Evolution is a scientific theory meaning that its scientific fact. It's is not, however, a scientific law. In order to be a law, we (scientists) must be able to predict that it will happen and then observe it happening. We have proof that verifies evolution, but we have no way of predicting when it may happen or how it will happen. This is unlike gravity where we can predict that if we drop a bowling ball from a certain height that it will hit the ground at a certain speed and time. Just because evolution is called a theory does not mean it is not fact. If it was a hypothesis it could be disproven.\u00a0 And scientists can't directly observe evolution, but we observe its affects. It's like wind.

There's several excellent proofs of evolution that we know about, my personal favorite is the speckled moths.  Now, there are two varieties of these moths- some have an allele (that's the term for two forms of the same gene) for dark colouring, and some for light. Before the industrial revolution, tree barks were light coloured and so the light coloured moths survived longest and had more offspring, outnumbering the dark coloured moths by a huge percentage because the dark coloured ones were more easily noticed by birds and so eaten.  When the industrial revolution started, all the trees started to get coated in soot, darkening their colour. Now it was the light coloured moths that were spotted more and so the population changed, with the moths with the allele for dark colouring surviving longer than their lighter coloured relatives.  After we started to change from coal to gas, the trees got lighter again and the balance swung back in favour of the light coloured moths. Remember, humans had no direct connection in this. They just changed the tree colours.

We have very clear fossil records of gradual limb development, gradual skeletal development, Ect.. Leading to altogether different species in a matter of 10s or 100s of thousands of years. We've barely known about evolution for 150 years. We have gradual development in skull structure across reptiles leading to mammals. We have original smaller dinosaur fossils increasingly and very gradually developing feathers eventually forming birds. There are very many examples of speciation, they're just apparent through fossils, not through the present. In a matter of thousands of years, we humans have been able to take wolves to pomeranians, and create such a diverse set of dogs.
