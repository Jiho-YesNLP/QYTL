Language is t just verbal/audible , it\u2019s largely body language and facial expression. It was difficult for me as a hearing person raised with ASL to assimilate into regular western society due to the nature of hearing people being quite non-expressive in general. I perceived the world as a very unfriendly place coming out of an exuberant deaf culture , which was then taxing to my mental health. It\u2019s been my life\u2019s journey to learn the differences and affects of language barriers. Most notably my experience drove me to insanity trying to balance communicating to my deaf brother simultaneously translating to the world around me whilst developing in my teen years. I was constantly aware of how loud we are as a population, and if we used body language correctly we would be a more peaceable species. I became quite isolated in my adolescent due to overwhelm in the school system and in various jobs. But this lecture reminded me of the impact this situation has had on my life enough to give myself a pat on the back for even attempting to face such an unfriendly seeming world .

At 47:00, Prof. Sapolsky emphasizes the explosive acquisition of new words by children. \"By college, a typical person has a vocabulary of 60,000 words...There is an innate drive towards language acquisition.\" This number floats along the waves of demonstrating that kids are able to generate structures of grammar they have never learnt or encountered before, i.e. 47:55 \"They are constructing rules out of imperfect, partial examples...You can have statistical learning.\" At 48:12 \"You can pick up the rules from statistical patterns.\" This is the key Chomsky argument. Still, this seems more aimed at generating constructions, rather than generating words. Generating new words is not as easy. There are a few ways that can generate new words by using some simple rules. For instance, from grammar, you get grammatical, perhaps grammarian (?), ungrammatical, grammatically, etc..But that does not get too far, here in fact you\u2019re just deriving variations on the same basic word, not acquiring a new word. \u00a0 The number of \"60,000 words\" at college level seems simply a rhetorical exaggeration to make a basic point, not a scientific result. Even if you imply passive recognition and understanding in listening and reading, rather than active acquisition and  use in speech and writing. Note that a taxi driver can get by with 50 to 100 words, ordinary daily life requires at most a few hundred words (if that many). A college student may get by with 1,000 words, and that is already a huge number. Only a small % of the population is called upon to use a wide variety of words. Mainly professionals of language, who use it all day long: writers and speakers: lawyers, politicians, diplomats, orators, journalists, teachers, academics, comedians, preachers, etc. \u2014 perhaps 10% of the global population. Their children start life with a huge linguistic advantage: They are exposed from an early age to the richer vocabulary and advanced sentences of their parents. Note, in the same vein, that Prof. Sapolsky's father had been an academic professor, a historian of architecture \u2014 an early mentoring support that must have given our learned Professor an early stimulation and continued guidance for developing his own passion for using words. \u00a0 A top professional writer with many known books to his credit may use up to 5- 6,000 different words. The Belgian writer Georges Simenon is famous for having written 500 books using only (computer count) 2,500 words. A similar statistic could be set for science writer Isaac Asimov, also with 500 published books under his pen. The Authorized King James Version of the Bible uses 12,143 different English words for a total count of 783,000 words (or about 1.5%). Milton reaches that level of 12,000 different words. And Shxpr is alone in his class, with a never-equalled use of about 20,000 different words (ignoring the easy variants of the same basic word), according to David Crystal, in a grand total of 884,647 words. Of those, over 1,700 words were the first recorded use in English, although many of his creations didn't stick. In terms of creating new words that have become accepted \"neologisms\", radically new words accepted in the common language,, Milton is the top generator in English with 630 words added to the body of the English language, against Ben Jonson with 558, John Donne with 342 and Shakespeare with 229. But \"acquiring\" (whatever that means) 60,000 words? As a college student? Not in your wildest dreams. A wonderful exercise could be to just scan all the 27 lectures in Prof. Sapolsky's course presented here by Stanford on YouTube, and thanks to the subtitles, count the different vocabulary being used. Then add to the review the words in his 6 or 7 books, and count again. No need to include the public lectures, or various articles, as they practically use all the vocabulary already recorded in the lectures and the books, and would add only marginal new stuff. So what would be one good estimate of the total different words? 5 to 6, 000 words? That would already be pretty sensational. True, you could argue, Prof. Sapolsky certainly \"knows\" many more words passively than the active vocabulary he's used in his lectures and writing. Granted, but then, as a wild stretch, twice as many? As a (generous) guess, say 10 to 12,000 total? Perhaps. That, in our pleasant flight of fantasy, would put our Stanford Professor in the Milton and Bible class. But, still, no way ever to get to 60,000 words.

My telephone rang and I answered it.  A woman's voice said something to me in English.  I KNEW it was English, but I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD, as if it were in Greek or some other non-English language!  I asked the woman to repeat what she said and I COULD UNDERSTAND MYSELF SPEAKING IN ENGLISH.  She repeated her statement and I again got the same result.  This, as you might imagine, greatly disturbed me, so I again asked here to repeat what she had said twice and again I could understand myself speaking English with no problem.  This time I CONCENTRATED on what she was saying (hard to explain how, now) and suddenly it was like a switch being thrown and I could understand her perfectly and she had indeed said the same thing three times, but now I could understand every word.  I did not like what she said and hung up, but this event has bothered me since that time.  At the time I had no idea that the brain has two interlocked, but separate, portions for hearing and speaking a language, but something selectively switched off one of them (the hearing part) in my head without touching the speaking part at all.

For example, a seemingly silly one would be:  What came first, flight or wings?  No matter how you might look at it, if you try to fly without ALREADY having some sort of wing, no matter how poor it might be as a wing (as long as it can work for some realistic situations), you may survive some wing-required event where if you tried to fly without it, in many case you would end up dead after a long fall (from a tree or cliff or whatever).  When you start thinking this way, you have to apply this kind of logic to almost EVERYTHING that happens, particularly in the growing up of a living thing -- some combinations in order will kill you and others will allow you to live, even though the same pieces are involved in all combinations.  Learning to speak is just as or even more complicated as flying, so the what is the cause and what is the result has to be worked out first before you can start to really understand what is going on to allow this chain of events to happen.  To summarize:    Random events without some already existing structures to sort them out as good or bad are almost never going to allow a person or any other living thing to become an adult with all of its body and mind intact and fully operating like others of its kind; there are simply too many things that can happen, most of them being fatal...", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "UgyYL7sSlC3w1i4auA14AaABAg", "comment": "1:04:00", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "Ugx67UtDpe8bHGYvH8J4AaABAg", "comment": "you yup you yup you transend indeed.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "UgzHaGFQOA4kiecZGQp4AaABAg", "comment": "The Biology Of Religion - I wish they taped it !", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "Ugw4XR4apX73scL-9lR4AaABAg", "comment": "Attempts to teach apes language starts at: 1:18:50  Koko the gorilla discussion starts at: 1:28:03", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "Ugzwq6biuSEoUNdCG2d4AaABAg", "comment": "He has good beard.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "UgzY4H22aO0ozdrzTyh4AaABAg.9YUC5kzxML59YkfTUQFubz", "comment": "Good luck with mr.

Maybe he hydrates significantly during breaks (?), and of course, we just never see that in these videos.  I just 'discovered' these YT lectures...having become curious about him and his (disillusioning) declaration,  'we have no free will'...followed by his brief explanation WHY in a recent interview I watched. This came up in his (also fascinating) interview by Addrew Huberman (Huberman lectures every Monday on his neuroscience Podcast)...and is, himself, a fascinating Stanford lecturer.  Someone mentioned in Huberman's comments' section that Sapolsky also lectures on YT. Idk if Sapolsky has his own YT podcast, but in searching YT for his lectures, came across these Stanford U Lectures of his from 10 yrs ago.  So, yah, I initially began watching these trying to figure why he believes we have no free will - hoping I'd somehow find him to be wrong about that...and now I'm hooked on this series of lectures. Nevermind that they are 10 YO. As disappointed as I was about his stance on man's free will, with these lectures it is beginning to dawn on me why he's come to that conclusion.

Each word is corresponding to some entity/object/action/property/whatever, and you can't half-mention some entity in your speach (be not mistaken with mentioning half of an entity). Other POV: usually most of words are derived from other words by some change in one single morphem - sounds very simmilar, sematics  does not change that much, but that still is a new word. So, your shortenings are not halfes of worda, but whole words, new ones.   There can be other hard-to-resolve speculation though... What if  someone stops his speach right in the middle of pronounciating some word (for example, signal suddently lost, or talking person was instantly killed to prevent him saying magic word), and that was some long complex word, context is  almost absend, so you end up with half of spoken word phonetically, and also in semantics: part you have heard allows you to reduce the set of possible entities(ones speaker wanted to designate with that word), but meaning is till ambigous. Or  you heard some words at noisy channel: some bits of info gone, but some persist (btw, if you have lost just 1 bit of info, that can be rendered axactly as half of the word, because now it is reducing possible variability twice worse than before.

Lecture 25 of this Stanford series is about INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, and that applies to teachers as well. Each one has a different style, and a different effect on students. Any comparison by a student is limited to a very narrow experience and concerns a very narrow sample of teachers. Each commenter is strongly biased by his recent and extremely limited personal experience. None is an expert. As our Incredibly Learned Professor explained in the previous lecture 22. EMERGENCE & COMPLEXITY, it would take a huge quantity of comparisons to establish a semblance of the Wisdom of the Crowds, with none right on the dot, but somehow circling around it.\u00a0 Until then, each exulting student's acclaim of \"The very best!\" is a highly subjective comment with little objective validity, just a shout from his limbic system and dopaminergic system. In fact, each glowing comment here is about pleasure and fascination, ecstatic wonder at the breath-taking performance of our Incredibly Learned Professor. The reaction is more about the astonishing effect of the lecturing as an amazing show, and its unstoppable energy, and none about learning.\u00a0\"Quite interesting\" he would remark in one of his apartes (his way of making a quick pause and catching his breath for the next outflow). This normal enthusiasm does not justify pooh-poohing all the other teachers active in other great universities who may well prove in their own styles as efficient, and possibly, more so than our INCREDIBLY LEARNED PROFESSOR. For instance, a simple test of efficacy would be, after  each lecture, at the door, to get a response from each student who attended: \"What is it that you remember now from this lecture? How many points?\".\u00a0 It is undeniable that our Incredibly Learned Professor is obsessed with the desire to cram the densest amount of incredibly (no pun) diverse information into the tightest of time, without taking any break in his breath-taking speed, as if he were a thoroughbred racing for a top trophy.\u00a0Experienced orators who want to make an impact with their message know that in order for your message to sink into your audience, you need to take pauses. The pauses are what allow the amygdala and the hippocampus of listeners to store the torrent of information received from an orator at their own natural speed.  I, for one, watching each lecture on video at my leisure, find it necessary to hit the pause button, backtrack on some passages for a few seconds or minutes. And eventually, to view a given video many times, 2 or even 3 times to be able to register the immense quantity of facts of each lecture. I often feel the need to go to his books, ZEBRA and BEHAVE, or TESTOSTERONE and MONKEYLUV, for more detailed explanations. \u00a0 Occasionally, I even need some more precise answers on names or concepts from Wikipedia.\u00a0Following our Incredibly Learned Professor's method, I find it necessary to go back in time, one book earlier, two books earlier, etc, reviewing all the previous phases of his personal intellectual/emotional development to fully understand his present style of lecturing. I even was brave enough to go all the way back to his very first book, STRESS, THE AGING BRAIN & THE MECHANISMS OF NEURON DEATH\u201d (1992), hoping to glean some additional insight in his approach.

A couple things he gets wrong though or doesn't go into all the nuances. 1) Broca's area isn't just for language productions and mouth movement. Its most prominent role is in word order or \"syntax\" and more specifically in syntactic memory. But neuroscientists have moved away from models of Broca's region for syntax, Wernicke's for semantics and towards more complex models that focus on different pathways around the perisylvian fissure (the fold that splits the brain right there). Angela Friederici is one of the best researchers in terms of language in the brain if you're curious to read more.  2) He dismisses B. F. Skinner's contributions to language research way too fast. The history of it's actually very interesting. Skinner wrote this book Verbal Behavior that adapted behaviorism to studying language. Chomsky wrote a review of it that not only decimated it but pretty much brought down behaviorism and started the \"cognitive revolution.\" It's a brilliant take-down but the problem is that Chomsky basically just makes a lot of straw man arguments of ideas that Skinner never even held. Anyways, Chomsky's influence lasted for decades but there's been a resurgence of interest in Skinner's approach. In fact, the statistical methods that Sapolsky mentions where people learn language based on the probabilities of certain words being next to each other owes a lot to Skinner. Types of reinforcement that can be adapted from behaviorism can account for these probabilities. Statistical models are increasingly in favor and pushing out Chomsky's generative grammar. Especially since the computer models of language that have the most success (like Google translate) are based purely on statistical models. The types of learning behind these neural networks have close parallels to Skinner's operant conditioning. Anyways, Skinner's been laughed at in linguistic circles for decades but he's been gaining ground recently.

Since sound imaging differs from abstraction in important ways, and since emotional and arousal states cannot be hidden from their detection, we observe yet other species whose brains are not evolved to coevolve around deception, for which a certain symbolic verbal communicator's brain is designed.   Numerous cetacean species have brains 5x human, with the now-surprising Physeter macrocephalus (Moby Dick, most of whom were genocidally slaughtered for two centuries, for lamp and machine oil) having the world's largest at 9x human, with new evidence of observational capacity and some kind of descriptive communication - teaching or learning skills through sonic observation and/or expression in water far too murky for visual learning.  Neocortex, allocortex, and neuronal density differs in various brains; Since some modulation has been found through certain glial cells, the issue is still quite opaque and unknown to human research.  Alliance Francaise limits their language to a smaller total vocabulary. Very top-down. Most other languages accept new words, especially scientific.  Ravens and many other animals, like the human animal, can hold 7 objects in mind - above that counting is necessary. Oddly, Clark's Nutcracker remember some 3,000 locations. They perhaps use up space for spatial memory that downslope birds use for more social skills. Location and orientation skills are an ethological subject worthy of extensive discussion, having to do with cognitive choice.   Dr. Irene Pepperberg at Purdue and other U's later, worked with a parrot, discovering an intentional and highly social communication capacity, able to vocalize pronouns and emotional responses in English.  Other birds pass that self-recognition test in mirrors, pecking or grooming at dabbed-on objects - once used as an attempt to prove that humans and a few primates were the only animals with \"consciousness.\"  I remember prosody as being emphasis, rhythm, and tone variation.  Intentionality: A young adolescent Wolf who cannot understand human nuance, would become excited as I finally responded to a new intentional signal. A teacher, indeed! Since wolves wag tails in highly specific ways only in concordance with intent (unlike the very neotenous domestic canid), dominant and assertive wolves raise and flag their tails (yes, they mistake the obligate curled-up husky, UNTIL they realize that it is not offensively intended. They learn nearly immediately that gesture of domestics does not share their wild species' meaning). Tail wags of different speeds, styles, and heights have different distinct meaning to observers who share understanding of the signal.  Hormonal signaling is highly important. Wolves have a great number of exocrine glands- even we retain differentially-smelling hand and feet exudations. \u00a0A little evidence of hormonal reception as communicationevoking intentinoality: I've seen 2-day old passage of familiar canids immediately excite and promote social signaling and inquisitive tracking - different by far from prey-signaling and mere asocial curiosity; also seeing tracks washed away by waves evoke excited acceleration, gazing toward likely direction, pursuit - all with momentary stares toward companions to signal intent.  Meanwhile the record for developmentally-arrested dog word understanding exceeds at least 400; while different breeds have lost some social attention for wolf language - gestural, postural, ears, facial, contextual. \u00a0Familiaris retain recognition of some C. lupus vocalizations, but are mired in excessive usage. Wolves meanwhile, extremely quickly use the trope we call Theory of Mind in increasingly efficient glance/context intentional signaling. With long association in free and wild conditions, the Wolf would respond to my teasing pretension to not- or mis- understand with variable nips (hard! if it was urgent or his mood was short), up to the hilarious grasp of an entire thigh with a just-firm-enough alligator grip, dragging me toward the intended goal or action). Just as human babies learn meaningful sounds from adult interaction, so do wolf pups learn significance through resting in direct physical contact with elders. Species with separately mobile ears, from ungulates to social canids, appear to have the  ability to monitor aurally in two channels. One ear attending to a bonded one, the other monitoring the environment, suggesting that differential stimulation of one side of the brain may very likely be occurring. Silent communication or signaling is important to most mammals.

Even 48 years ago I had met one fellow who told me that he had helped more people than anyone else in the world, I knew a classically educated greek and latin speaking man who had taught himself old english and italian and chinese to read Ezra Pounds works in the original after which he wrote a letter in chinese to Pound which led to them corresponding in chinese till the end of Pound's life, I told a fellow who picked me up hitchhiking in western Colorado that I was 3 days from checking a railroad job in Parsons Kansas which stimulated him to tell me of moving there by covered wagon 67 years before where his dad worked the RR till 1910 they travelled by covered wagon 3 months to homestead in Colorado, seeing many people on a beach in the florida keys meeting with where ya from and how long have you been here caused the young wisewoman to advise us of the value of saying interestingly what interested us to stimulate the reply. So yes I go around telling people \"Every good thing will happen to you.\" I have the world record that more people have told me \"Every good thing will happen to you\" than anyone in the world. I tell everyone \"You're natural state is ecstatic wonder.\" Apparently I have a high tolerance for people looking at me like I am sprouting a 3rd head.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "UgznF6_uZHOV8xVP1zl4AaABAg.8GcHaXVrsyg9LIZ4fqCibg", "comment": "Language is a gate of consciousness, and your search can lead you to our joint responsibility: consciously directed growth.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "SIOQgY1tqrU", "cid": "UgznF6_uZHOV8xVP1zl4AaABAg.8GcHaXVrsyg9NIjQLWwBsd", "comment": "I spoke to invite transcendent insight.
