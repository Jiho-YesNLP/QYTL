We are all concerned about: (one) public health, \u00a0(two) occupational safety and health, and (three) one\u2019s individual health and well-being: and chemistry is involved in all three of these areas.   \u00a0  School students are concerned with getting an education to prepare them for post-high school life and that involves an understanding of English, basic mathematics, science, history and personal survival skills.\u00a0 Today pre-calculus, biology and chemistry are studied by most high school students planning on continuing their education for an associate or baccalaureate degrees.   \u00a0  Chemistry many decades ago had been broken down into the following disciplines: general chemistry, inorganic, organic, analytical, physical, biochemistry. Following the Manhattan Project in WW II, radio or nuclear chemistry became an important component of physical chemistry.\u00a0 Nuclear chemistry now plays an important role in nuclear medicine \u2013 witness positron emission tomography used to map out certain cancer tumors in humans.  \u00a0  The two introductory MIT courses in chemistry 5111 and 5112 augmented by the thermodynamics and kinetics 5600 course are foundation courses for university students in chemistry, molecular biology, physics, and engineering.\u00a0 The 5112 course is a little more advanced that the 5111 course and includes more physical chemistry. The thermodynamics course \u2013 involving the interplay of energy, work and heat - requires an understanding of simple calculus.\u00a0   \u00a0  These courses in chemistry presume that a student has some prior background in elementary chemistry, simple calculus, and elementary physics.\u00a0 That these top notch courses have been videotaped and posted on You Tube are great gifts by MIT to the whole world.\u00a0 Each course costs about $5,000 to videotape and merits financial support by those viewers who are capable of doing so.   \u00a0  These three courses allow viewers in the world to refresh their understanding of chemistry and to continue their education whether it be in chemistry, physics, modern biology, engineering or technology, environment or public health.  \u00a0  Those who are weak in mathematics and want to acquire a basic background in calculus at the AP level can do so with the most elementary and shortest text [194 pages in length] written in the 20th Century by W. L. Ferrar from Oxford University entitled \u201cCalculus for Beginners\u201d or they may view Richard Delaware\u2019s two courses posted on You Tube \u201cCollege Algebra\u201d and \u201cCalculus\u201d [University of Missouri at Kansas City]. Professor Delaware\u2019s two elementary courses prepare one well for MIT\u2019s video taped course \u2013 \u201cSingle Variable Calculus.\u201d  \u00a0  Since the early times most humans have been involved in counting, measuring, and interacting with their environment. The sun, moon, planets and stars generated much curiosity.   \u00a0  The world of humans, plants, animals, microbes have depended upon elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, iron, copper, lead, calcium, helium, neon, lithium, iodine, magnesium, etc.   \u00a0  Elements are the basic building blocks of matter that can undergo reactions to produce water, carbon dioxide, urea, etc. \u00a0Prior to 1938 with the discovery of nuclear fission elements were thought to be indivisible even though natural radioactivity had been detected in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. \u00a0  \u00a0  The radiant energy from the sun provided warmth to support life.\u00a0 It also produced the driving energy to allow certain plants to undergo photosynthesis. The processes taking place in the Sun to generate solar involved fusion reactions of elements in the CNO cycle.  \u00a0  Since the mid 1600\u2019s science - thanks to the Gutenberg press - and creative individuals made great progress. The framework for the development of quantitative science is coordinate geometry and that involves directed numbers, ordered pairs, ordered triples, etc.   \u00a0  A Science has three distinguishing features: (one) it has and organized body of knowledge, (two) a language and notation, and (three) a set of tools.\u00a0 So calculus one of the branches of mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, physics, metallurgy, economics, psychology, etc are sciences.\u00a0 Some sciences are logical disciplines which may or may not apply to the real world. \u00a0  \u00a0  All the molecular sciences beyond the introductory ones and statistics are calculus based An introduction to molecular cell biology involves lots of chemical bonding concepts but little mathematics unless one addresses population growth or thermodynamics \u2013 the interplay between energy, heat and work for a system with boundaries.  \u00a0   All the molecular sciences involve three basic entities: (1) Matter [material that occupies a definite volume], Force or Torque [that drives motion], (2) Force [that leads to motion or static equilibrium] and (3) Energy [the ability to do work].   \u00a0  Force is a vector quantity \u2013 it has coordinate components, magnitude and obeys two algebraic laws.\u00a0 The tool for dealing with motion is calculus. There are many different forms of energy \u2013 mechanical, chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, and nuclear.\u00a0 Electromagnetic energy involves two vectors \u2013 one electric and the other magnetic \u2013 and the scalar and vector products in terms of the divergence and curl both of which are studied in the second calculus course called multivariable calculus.\u00a0   \u00a0  The standard university text on calculus is that by James Stewart, \u201cCalculus - the Early Transcendentals\u201d printed in nine different and currently in the 8th edition.\u00a0 It is used in many different countries in the world.   \u00a0  Chemistry has many flavors \u2013 descriptive or practical, theoretical or industrial.\u00a0 Since 2000 we have been living in the Century of Biology which involves considerable biochemistry. Within an animal cell there are over a hundred thousand reactions taking place.\u00a0   \u00a0  The world of biology changed in 1973 with the discovery by Crick and Watson of the double helical structure of DNA \u2013 a sophisticated structure in biochemistry \u2013 through the X-ray diffraction of crystalline DNA and application of group theory from mathematics that capitalized on symmetry of crystalline DNA.\u00a0   \u00a0  If one feels the need to have a help book to accompany these video taped MIT basic chemistry courses, a popular one is that by Neal Jespersen,\u201cChemistry,\u201d1997,published in the Barron\u2019s College Review Series.", "votes": "6", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-c-X8zk0ywo", "cid": "UgzqDGB0q7abVp73Dtd4AaABAg", "comment": "saludos desde M\u00e9xico, what i need to do for take class in that incredible school and with this amazing teacher", "votes": "1", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-c-X8zk0ywo", "cid": "UgjnE8OC8hqwt3gCoAEC", "comment": "thank you very much for the open course and i will be glad if you can develop a email id and provide it to us where we can ask our problems and get them sorted", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-c-X8zk0ywo", "cid": "UghIzLRfDRamingCoAEC", "comment": "\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e, MIT !", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "-c-X8zk0ywo", "cid": "UgjA4SqqxuLe3HgCoAEC", "comment": "I hate these lecturers who tell you \"their story\" get on with lady!!!
