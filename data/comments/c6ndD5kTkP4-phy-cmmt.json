Tension is the opposite of compression. When an object is experiencing tension, it's being pulled apart, so it will get taller and thinner. When an object is in compression, it's being squeezed, so it will get shorter and fatter. Tensile strength is an object's resistance to defamation. Defamation is the measure of how much an object becomes taller/shorter or thinner/fatter.
