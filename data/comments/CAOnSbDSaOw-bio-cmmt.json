The professor begins by providing a historical overview of the limbic system, tracing its evolution from the olfactory-centered \"rhinencephalon\" to its current understanding as a multifaceted system integrating various sensory inputs with emotional responses. The lecture then explores the diverse structures within the limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and prefrontal cortex, highlighting their interconnectedness and their respective roles in fear, anxiety, memory, aggression, and social behavior. The importance of considering ethological factors, such as species-specific behaviors and individual differences in dominance hierarchies, is emphasized when interpreting neural activity and function. Additionally, the lecture examines the bidirectional communication between the brain and body, demonstrating how bodily states can influence emotional experiences through mechanisms like the James-Lange theory of emotion. The influence of hormones like epinephrine and the effects of meditation and biofeedback are discussed as examples of this bidirectional communication. Finally, the lecture concludes by highlighting the limitations of current neuroscientific techniques in fully understanding the complex interplay of factors contributing to emotional experiences and behaviors.  Summary  Introduction to the Limbic System  * 0:00 - Introduction to the limbic system and its role in emotion, contrasting it with the motor functions of the spinal cord. * 2:49 - The historical evolution of the term \"limbic system\" from the initial concept of the \"rhinencephalon\" (\"nose-brain\") due to its prominence in olfactory-driven animals like rats. * 5:32 - The importance of ethology in understanding the varying roles of the limbic system across different species, as the dominant sensory inputs influencing emotions differ. * 7:52 - Overview of Paul MacLean's triune brain model, with the limbic system positioned between the reptilian brain (hypothalamus and brainstem) and the cortex. * 14:07 - Debunking the myth of the cortex as a purely rational entity, emphasizing the bidirectional influence between the cortex and limbic system in emotional and cognitive processes.  Structures of the Limbic System  * 24:12 - Introduction to the major nuclei of the limbic system: amygdala, hippocampus, septum, mammillary bodies, thalamus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal cortex (including the anterior cingulate). * 34:16 - Exploring the interconnectedness of these structures, highlighting key pathways such as the amygdalofugal pathway connecting the amygdala and hippocampus, and the fornix connecting the hippocampus and septum. * 37:07 - Discussing the concept of \"inefficient wiring\" in the brain, reflecting both embryonic development and evolutionary history.  Function of the Limbic System  * 43:24 - Techniques for studying limbic system function: lesion studies, stimulation studies, recording studies, anatomical studies, and biochemical and imaging techniques. * 51:47 - Limitations of these techniques, including the difficulty of distinguishing between centers and fibers of passage, and the challenge of defining \"centers\" for complex emotional functions. * 55:20 - The importance of ethology in interpreting neural activity, considering species-specific behaviors and individual differences (e.g., dominance hierarchies).  Limbic System Structures and Their Functions  * 1:00:57 - Amygdala: fear, anxiety, aggression, and male sexual motivation. * 1:02:19 - Septum: inhibition of aggression. * 1:03:18 - Hippocampus: learning and memory, turning off the stress response. * 1:04:26 - Mammillary bodies: aspects of maternal behavior. * 1:04:44 - Prefrontal cortex: emotional regulation, impulse control, long-term planning, gratification postponement, empathy, and social intelligence. * 1:06:03 - Ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens: dopamine release, pleasure anticipation, and motivation for reward-seeking behavior.  Bidirectional Communication: Brain and Body  * 1:13:12 - The James-Lange theory of emotion: the body's physiological responses influence emotional experiences. * 1:15:13 - The role of epinephrine in modulating emotional intensity. * 1:18:38 - The effects of benzodiazepines on anxiety and muscle relaxation. * 1:20:10 - The influence of meditation and biofeedback on blood pressure and emotional regulation. * 1:21:42 - The impact of sympathetic arousal on emotional processing and memory retrieval.

My last name is Caffery (Celt-Father)/Zavala (Spanish/Mother), both relate to horses, I was born 1978 a horse year. So I have shamanistically assumed/absorbed symbolic value/characteristics FROM \"the horse\" [in my psyche]. To sum up THAT value I adopted this phrase [I read] as a mantra \"It is not in the nature of a horse to go backwards.\" Consider an article in some mythology magazine publication discussing famous figures horses: Buddha, Alexander, George Washington. All this to explain Hippocampus is meant to symbolize the VALUE of perpetual forward progression INTO the water/psyche/self. I have to assume based on my janitorial expertise that this section actually does something that relates to this IMAGERY as I can [re]interpret it. If this holds any credible information (I have watched most of these 2-4x each) part of the way I make this stuff up (or maybe 'see' it) is when I realized [reading, On Killing] just what a \"media\" IS [to the Psyche] it changed the way I saw everything. I have since found quite from another significant source to my intellectual structure that really sums it up. But the key is, like media, ads are just a word what they TRY to convey is [kinda/a form of] \"eternity\" (in a J. Campbell \"eternity\" definition).

In my opinion this should not be the case, because during my whole life I have never noticed that descendants have the same character as one or the other parent. Therefore, I assume that each person forms his or her own individual character. First this happens through the basic character formation that takes place during pregnancy in the mother's womb. This is followed by the educational character, which is formed by education and environmental influences during the first seven years of life. And finally, through self-education the character of life is formed, which results from the first two character forms and from the character of self-education.\r \r Ptaah:\r 85. The character cannot be inherited and is therefore not genetically conditioned.\r 86. The actual character, which you correctly call life character, is formed by the basic character or pregnancy and prenatal character as well as by the educational character and the self-educational character, as you have correctly explained.\r 87. All three stages of character formation are therefore decisive for the final character form, the character of life.\r 88. The entire process of character formation takes place in the limbic system in which the instance of morality is located.\r \r Billy:\r This is probably the instance that decides on the negative and positive as well as on the good and bad or honest and dishonest thinking, feeling and acting?\r \r Ptaah:\r 89.

I try to watch all things Sapolsky and all things Susskind, at least. Though I am often sidetracked by other Stanford videos and video courses.   I wish I had continued my education to the Piled  -higher & Deeper level as originally planned. But Love got in the way of that and gave me a different though still wonderful life of learning. Now though that has past to a great degree and so with those passions quiescent I return to learning which, it turns out, is my greatest desire and has always been. It is what I describe as fun.  Author Richard Bach made the convincing argument that we choose to live human lives for one or both of two reasons, to learn and to have fun. When learning IS fun then one has a most satisfactory life. Time spent away from actively pursuing these two objectives is time wasted unless what one does includes learning and fun as a part. Time spent bickering, outright fighting (physical or verbal), in hours of mindless drudgery which is work in which one finds no pleasure, or in other situations that have no novelty, but are simply rote ritual repetition are but stagnation. At the end of which one feels empty and wasted, stretched thin like \u201ctoo little butter on too much bread\u201d. At such a realization one is wont to die.

Evolution is a gradual process (even so a little bit punctuated as we now know haha) so at first these absolutely relevant systems evolved, after some time the dienzephalon \"joined\" to integrate information from ears, sensible infos and eyes (ontogenesis is really interesting here, eyes are originally part of the dienzephalon) and a lot more (e.g. hypothalamus is part of the dienzephalon). Next step is the evolution of the cortex with higher functions like contiousness, learning, control of emotions (PFC). The pyramidal system`s origin is the Cortex, extrapyramidal is e.g. Tractus rubrospinalis (Nucleus ruber is a nucleus in the mesenzephalon -> brain stem). One ground rule is that things are completed earlier the older they are (in ontogenesis): so the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which isn\u00b4t finished until age 25 is a new acquiry (makes senese doesn\u00b4t it?). Same with the pyramidic system it isn-t fully myelated until age 3 or so (look for the Babinksy-Reflex in the internet!) whereas the extrapyramdial tracts are well formed the moment you are born.

IMO sapolsky's way and his philosophy in teaching is to initiate the attendee's critical thinking and analysis on the given subject. His lectures are meant to be a general schematic explanation in other word, introductory. With how expansive and multifaceted his subject of teaching is its not efficient to even elaborate the specific detail and i doubt the attendee will even remember all of it at the end of the session.

The theme is consistent throughout a lecture and there absolutely is coherence between anecdotes and fact regurgitation. You also have to consider we do not have assignments, additional reading or tutoring from him. We only see this single frame of his total teaching.  At the start of each lecture he recaps the previous, to prime the memory to create associations with additional input from the current lecture. Ironically, he talks about this in some of the memory lectures.  The purpose of these lectures is to engage meaningfully with people, not to be like a textbook. People are here to be stimulated to lean deeply into the topic. An example of arguably much poorer lecturing, subjectively speaking, is the series regarding general relativity. That instantly put me to sleep. Literally. I listen to those lectures to put me to sleep... and I AM HAVE A DOCTORATE IN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY LOL.

Ok, I do get that the man has a different style of tutoring, and that the vast majority of course information comes from his lectures. And I do admit that one needs time to adjust, it got better for me after watching a couple of lectures. But still... Let me give an example. Starting at 22m34 in this video, he says:  \".. and back to that rhinencephalon business - that, you know, rodents are super olfactory and fish do whatever they do\"  What does the 'fish do whatever they do' offer, except adding more confusion to the mix ?   \"and again don't tell Fernald,\"  (the man still did not close his sentence)   \"and all these other species have their...\"  (the man still did not close his sentence)\r   \"and we're not a particulary olfactory species\" \r (now he suddenly jumps to a different topic, and finally closes the sentence, without the whole sentence being coherent)   Perhaps his style of teaching fits better with some students than with others, and I am in the latter group.

I had been a smoker for 10 years, 3.5 to 4 packs a day. I quit once through \"willpower\".. cold turkey. That lasted about two months and then I still wanted badly to smoke, so I figured that this habit had been formed on a deeper level... not a physical addiction, so much as a psychological one. If I still wanted to smoke, where once I had no such desire (prior to developing the habit), then the trick was to re-train myself to NOT want to smoke. I reasoned that when I had re-trained my brain, that I would not smoke again, because I would not WANT to smoke. We do that which we want to and we do not do that which we do not want to do. Simple, right? So, I don't want to make this too long, but basically, I figured out that emotions are the key to motivation, and that I could actually generate emotions for the sole purpose of re-training that level of the brain where habits and preferences (avoidance / attraction) are stored, deep in the subconscious. Well, this is how I saw it, anyway. I had no training in medicine or psychology, but all of this seemed quite plausible to me. I was able to divide my self-identity into two parts.. a conscious administrative self, and a deeper, autonomic?, subconscious self. Emotion seemed to be the way to communicate between these two parts of the brain. Whereas most people seem to identify so strongly with their emotions and likes / dislikes, I understood that these likes / dislikes could be manipulated and formed by the waking, conscious, reasoning and administrative self, by the use of emotions. Theoretically, physical sensations would do the same, but I knew from personal experience that even physical discomfort can be \"ignored\" or over-ridden. Well, at any rate.. I formulated this theory and began to develop the steps to put it into practice. I could compare it a little bit to acting.. although I have never been involved in acting, but to my understanding, the really great actors can get so deeply involved in their role, that they become that person whom they are trying to portray. This is the second most difficult part, I suppose.. to learn to generate emotions which are unpleasant.. i.e. revulsion and disgust, and the awareness to keep this ball in play almost constantly, until the new habit is formed.. that being to dislike smoking. The first and possibly most difficult part is to become aware that you are NOT a compilation of emotions, likes and dislikes, but that you have a higher self which can make choices, and furthermore actually USE emotions as a way of communicating with the deeper mind.. Now I know that this is the \"limbic\" brain. And, it really is a matter of \"garbage in / garbage out\". I could go on, but I think you get the point. And, the good news is that the theory proved out and the method worked. I quit after two months of using this system on a daily basis. I also used positive reinforcement, by the way, but never anything like \"will power\", nor did I set a date. One day I found that I no longer wanted to smoke cigarettes and so  when I reached that point, I simply stopped smoking. Now, that was 50 years ago and I have not had one cigarette since then. I had a few \"smoking dreams\", which seemed to have the purpose of reinforcing abstinence. I was always so relieved to wake up, realizing that I had not actually smoked a cigarette. Once more thing I have to say.. After I had succeeded, I had such an incredible rush of confidence and self approval. This was the unexpected but awesome reward I was so impressed with, just feeling on top of the world and totally free after feeling \"owned\" by this destructive and expensive habit for all these long years.

We are ALL going do die one day from something. (The observable evidence for this is overwhelming).   2. We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced. (While science does not know what consciousness actually is, nor how memories are stored and retrieved, nor how thoughts actually occur, they do all appear to be functions of the physical brain.  When our brain dies for it's final time, 'we' die, for all of future eternity.  There is no conscious afterlife and certainly not an eternal conscious afterlife.  The sum total of our existence is only what we leave behind, including how our existence affected the larger society that we existed in).   The thing is though, there ALWAYS has to be at least one conscious entity left in the larger society for anyone or anything to have continued meaning to.  Based upon current analysis, with the 6th mass extinction event coming this century, and the 6th won't be the last, and that science tells us that this Earth and it's Sun will not last for literally all of future eternity, and our solar system is most probably being pulled toward our galactic center, hence existing in a spiral shaped galaxy in a cause and effect universe, and due to other issues in the analysis, it is highly doubtful any species from this Earth are going to consciously survive one day.  Of which:   3. We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.

Life itself only matters to life itself as long as life itself still exists.  It's just that the analysis would seem to indicate that life itself will not always exist, at least not from this Earth.  Life itself is an illusion, and like an illusion, only matters to a conscious entity while it lasts.  It's just that one day, per the analysis, it will all be over as there won't be a conscious entity left from this Earth to care.

Most probably that solar system would be getting pulled toward the galactic gravitational center.\r \r 4.  Ask yourself:  What does that mean for species that exist on a planet, that exists in a solar system, that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy, in an apparent cause and effect state of existence?  Most probably that if those species don't get off of that planet, and out of that solar system, and probably out of that galaxy too, (if it's even actually possible to do for various reasons), then they are all going to die one day from something and go extinct with probably no conscious entities left from that planet to care that they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less whatever they did and or didn't do with their time of existence.\r \r 5.  Ask yourself:  For those who might make it out of this galaxy, (here again, assuming it could actually be done for various reasons), where to go to next, how long to get there, how to safely land, and then, what's next?  Hopefully they didn't land in another spiral shaped galaxy or a galaxy that would become spiral shaped one day, otherwise, they would have to galaxy hop through the universe to stay alive, otherwise, they still die one day from something with no conscious entities being left from the original planet to care they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less that they made it out of their own galaxy.  They failed to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity.\r \r 6.  Ask yourself:  What exactly matters throughout all of future eternity and to whom does it exactly and eternally matter to?\r \r Either at least one species truly consciously survives throughout all of future eternity somehow, someway, somewhere, in some state of existence, even if only by a continuous succession of ever evolving species, for life itself to have continued meaning and purpose to, OR none do and life itself is all ultimately meaningless in the grandest scheme of things.\r \r Our true destiny currently appears to be:\r 1.  We are ALL going to die one day from something.\r 2.  We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced.\r 3.  We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.\r \r Currently:\r Nature is our greatest ally in so far as Nature gives us life and a place to live it, AND Nature is also our greatest enemy that is going to take it all away.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.\r   Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.\r \r a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.\r b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.\r c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.\r (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)\r d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.\r e. Do this with the em fields on and off.\r (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.)\r f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.\r (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)\r (And note:  if done right, it's possible a mini gravitational black hole might form.  Be ready for it.  In addition, it's possible a neutrino might be formed before the black hole stage, the neutrino being a substance with a very high gravitational modality with very low 'em' modalities.)\r \r (An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)\r \r 'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done.\r 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.

It goes beyond any quantum field theory formulas that I am currently aware of.  The outline though is basically as follows:\r \r The formula has at least 3 levels to it:\r 1. The Internal Photon Level:  The 3 interacting forces, (which might even be just a singular force with 3 different modalities), all interacting at basically 90 degrees to each other and all simultaneously pulsating and swirling.  A complex part of the formula but I believe to be totally doable.\r \r 2. The External Photon Level:  For each pulsating, swirling photon, all the pulsating, swirling photons interacting with it.  An exponential part of the formula that I am not even sure modern day super computers could adequately handle.\r \r 3. The Inter-dimensional Photon Level:  For each modality within each photon would have an energy frequency associated with it.  The energy frequencies could be seen as being in their own space time dimension.  (For me, 'space' is energy itself of which is the 'gem' photon and 'time' is the flow of energy; 'temperature' is the interaction of energy), so one would be dealing with way more than just 3 spatial dimensions and way more than just 1 time dimension (as there would many different energy frequencies with many different flows of energy).  Whenever like resonate energy frequencies resonated with each other, they would affect each other, kind of like 'spooky action at a distance'.  Anytime energy frequencies overlapped, there would be a temporary spike of some sort in each space time dimension.  In addition, if in reality the 'gem' photon is just a singular force with 3 different modalities, it's possible that energy could 'slip' between modalities which would also affect the results.  A very complex part of the formula on top of all the complexity that came before it.\r \r 4. Any time any energy moved in the system, the entire formula would have to be recalculated due to potential ripple effects.\r \r Like I said above, I don't even believe the mathematics exists yet for what I am trying to do, but at a minimum, the formula would contain the above levels the way I currently see it to be.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "Ugxh1QQhN798YfbZyu54AaABAg.8nMWW3gShkX9A-xSlHQshp", "comment": "\u00a0@rcc3574\u00a0 Possible completion of the Periodic Table of the Elements: (Copy and paste from my files): I currently believe that there are 120 chemical elements in this universe.

An eighth energy shell might exist with a maximum of two elements in it, chemical element #119 (8s1) and chemical element #120 (8s2).\r \r Chemical Element #119 (8s1):\r #119 I put at the bottom of the Hydrogen group on the Periodic Table of the Elements.  It only has one electron in it's outer shell with room for only one more electron.  Energy might even enter the atom through the missing electron spot and then at least some of the energy might get trapped inside of the atom under the atom's outer shell.\r \r Chemical Element #120 (8s2):\r #120 I put at the bottom of the Helium group since it's outer shell is full of electrons.  It might have some of the properties of group two, Beryllium group (Alkali Earth Metals group) since it has two electrons in it's outer shell; as well as some of the properties of the Helium group (Noble Gases group) since it's outer shell is full of electrons; and if you look at the step down deflection of the semi-metals and where #120 would be located on the chart, it's possible #120 might even have some semi-metal characteristics.  #120 would be the heaviest element in this universe.  I believe chemical element #120 could possibly be found inside the center of stars.\r \r When a neutron split inside of this atom, it would give off one proton, one electron, neutrinos and energy.  The proton and electron would be ejected outside of the atom since all their respective areas are full.  One proton and one electron are basic hydrogen, of which the Sun is primarily made up of, and the Sun certainly gives off neutrinos and energy.  And note, it's the neutron that split, not a proton.

Frequency being 'hertz', 'hertz being cycles per second, or how far an 'em' photon goes at a specific size during one second.\r e. \"IF\" wavelength changes (the frequency changes) then the distance a single 'em' photon goes would change and/or the size of space itself would change (assuming that an 'em' photon makes up 'space' itself).\r f. Possibly 'space' varies due to 'space' being made up of 'em' itself and as 'em' frequencies change, 'space' changes.\r g. Another possibility would be that as the wavelength changes (frequency changes) then as the distance a single 'em' photon goes would also change in it's time of existence, 'time' would change for any given 'em' photon length.  The effect of that single 'em' photon makes in it's given time of existence.\r h. Possibly 'time' varies due to the wavelength of the 'em' photon.\r i. So, possibly 'space' varies due to energy frequencies changing and 'time' varies due to the wavelength of energy changing, the 'em' photon being energy itself.  And if as I currently believe that what is called 'gravity' is actually a part of the 'em' photon, then the 'gem' photon makes up the energy unit that possibly makes up everything in existence in this entire universe including the universe itself, including 'space' and 'time' or 'space time' itself.

(To help prolong human's life).  But does it ultimately matter?  If so, to whom eternally to?  Currently, the analysis indicates that we are it.  We either figure out how to actually exist throughout all of future eternity somehow, someway, somewhere, in some state of existence, even if only by a continuous stream of ever evolving species, for life itself to have continued meaning and purpose to, OR none do and we all die one day from something, will forget everything we ever knew and experienced, and would all be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.  It wouldn't even matter that any of us existed much less how we existed while we existed.  Life itself would all be ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things.  Life itself would only matter to life itself only as long as life itself still existed.  It's just that life itself will not always exist.  Or so the current analysis would indicate.  I currently consider my self to be an 'existentialist', defined as one who studies topics related to existence itself, including ceasing to exist and non-existence.  I can even show how it's possible that existence and non-existence can exist side by side for all of eternity.  (Dependent on the gravity test results, which will speak for itself).  But does it ultimately matter?  If so, to whom does it eternally matter to throughout all of future eternity?  Here again, the current analysis would indicate that we are it.  And when we die, we are dead for all of future eternity.  Game over.  Thanks for playing the game of life, but no conscious entity is left to care.

Belief systems limit us greatly.\" You say I seem to be stuck in my mind ie mental reasoning.  Well, so are you for you to even type the sentences you type.  Your language is your belief system that you seem to be stuck in.  Why do you limit yourself so?  b.  \"I feel that all the questions you're asking and all the hopelessness and fear you're feeling  will ultimately lead you to where you need to be because we can only experience what we allow ourselves to.\" Currently, the ultimate answer to ALL questions in existence, including questions never ever even asked is:  \"It Does Not Ultimately Matter\", or in today's vernacular \"IDNUM\".  c.  \"I find that life can get the better of us when we're not flexible with our thoughts and attitudes.\" I have taken my mind from eternity past to future eternity and to a realm I call 'The Realm Of All Concepts' where nothing at all exists, not even space, time, logic nor reason, and yet everything that could ever be exists.  I have even taken my mind outside of this spacetime dimension into 'absolute nothingness' which is beyond our universal existence.  It was quite a mind trip, and 'no', no drugs utilized for the trip.  How much more do you want my mind to be flexible?  Keep traveling into eternity past, or into future eternity, or stay in the realm of all concepts, or stay in absolute nothingness beyond this existence?  Why do you limit yourself only to this existence?  d.  \"Hope you choose to experience a lighter and brighter side life...\" Funny you should say that, consider the following: 1.  Modern science claims that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.  Hence, energy is either truly eternally existent, or modern science is wrong. 2.  Modern science claims that we have new cells that come into existence inside of our body on a daily basis.  This appear to be really true.  So, since I have a body with energy and cells in it: *  A part of me is eternally existent and a part of me is being born anew on a daily basis. *  My current body extends from eternity past to now. *  Rising to a higher level of thought, the 'now' that I exist in is 'eternal'. *  I am currently existing in the 'eternal now'. *  I am currently an actual eternally existent conscious entity existing in the eternal now.  And if my TOE above is really true, then: *  I am currently an actual eternally existent conscious being of light existing in an environment entirely made up of light and interacting light, all existing in the eternal now.  But then again, if my definitions of spacetime is correct, then: *  I am eternally existent spacetime existing as 'me'.  \"I\" don't even actually exist but eternally existent spacetime existing as 'me'.  How could \"I\" ever die if \"I\" never ever existed at all in the first place?  And if eternally existent spacetime wanted to exist as 'me' throughout all of future eternity, whom am \"I\" to argue since \"I\" don't even actually exist in the first place?  Eternally existent spacetime would only have to will it to be so.  But why would it want to?  Just to experience all of future eternity as 'me'?  (Whatever form of 'me' it decides to take?  Shape shifter?)  e.  \"It's your life after all!\" Is it?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "Ugxh1QQhN798YfbZyu54AaABAg.8nMWW3gShkX9A1QOd5K0vx", "comment": "\u00a0@charlesbrightman4237\u00a0 Yes \"your life\" is a gathering of experiences that are unique to you.

If I were to hypothesis based on my own anecdotal experience (very unscientific. My own dream is to do research on this someday), I'd say that the left amygdala (the one of the two hemispherical amygdala's) has to do more with social fears (social anxiety) than the right amygdala. I'm very concerned with people being able to centralize their locus of control (this is why I'm strongly considering psychiatry as a field to go into), and I get the feeling that a lot of the philosophical thought I've done is not introspective in respect to self-focused, or perhaps that's only one part of it, but that I've been trying to figure something out about how to calm others and ease their worries, concerns, etc. That in essence is what social anxiety is. I like to say that the more difficult something is the greater the potential reward is for doing it. I think that's especially true for people who are very unique. If someone has the procedure, then push them to get into intense memory problems and remind them that effort is the thing that is most important. pushing oneself is the only way to improve, and hypothetically, the threshold for neurogenesis of people such as myself may be higher and more productive than the average persons.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "UgxJGfEXUAYb_s0uV5Z4AaABAg.8l_XxLZDM289T7rKeWiKOV", "comment": "We can identify the psychos yet do nothing about them...is it because we let the psychos be the ones to give ted talks on why we need psychos?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "UgxJGfEXUAYb_s0uV5Z4AaABAg.8l_XxLZDM289TYoBIx_Uu3", "comment": "\u00a0@kevinfairweather3661\u00a0 mii", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "UgxJGfEXUAYb_s0uV5Z4AaABAg.8l_XxLZDM289TjkXoEMFFv", "comment": "\u00a0@kevinfairweather3661\u00a0 lmaoo ayeee I do the samee\ud83d\ude02", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "UgxJGfEXUAYb_s0uV5Z4AaABAg.8l_XxLZDM289UVQWDMRvjt", "comment": "Yes!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CAOnSbDSaOw", "cid": "UgxJGfEXUAYb_s0uV5Z4AaABAg.8l_XxLZDM289UX6i6qv_Ej", "comment": "Oh hell yeah!
