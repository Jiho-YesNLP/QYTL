You said our rate constant should be more or less if we increase or decrease, respectively, the conc of reactants. But in another video you said that the rate constant depends on temperature and types of reactants and not the concentration of reactants nor products. Also, the chart itself shows that the rate constant does not change as we change the conc of either reactants - it always stays at 0.08. Can you please clarify? Did you mean initial rate?
