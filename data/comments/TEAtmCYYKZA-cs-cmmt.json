Sometimes game developers may forget to apply a seemingly obvious solution to smoothening an image, but more likely they're deliberately choosing not to, either because they don't have the resources to add it during development, or because of the computational cost associated with these solutions; ie. a game developed to run on high-end graphics card can use a lot more computational power for graphics solutions than a game developed to run on handheld consoles or smartphones.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TEAtmCYYKZA", "cid": "Ugwl3gxoP8DUmnfuW8p4AaABAg.8XBfvx-7ssZ8Z9FtI1YWlY", "comment": "I just change textures of people to bright orange and I can spot them from further distances and win.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TEAtmCYYKZA", "cid": "UgxpdVGOiXzXb2HUUE94AaABAg.8XBfjF0HX1s8XD1qG_JnqK", "comment": "At the risk of making Kiwis sound less special; 95% of the world's population approved of that...", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TEAtmCYYKZA", "cid": "UgwRgZtKa0PQpt5nPuJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Nice as always.
