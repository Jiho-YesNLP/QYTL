The integral we need to evaluate is \u222bC (z dx + x dy + y dz). According to Green's theorem, this is equal to the surface integral: \u222cS (\u2202y/\u2202x - \u2202x/\u2202y) dxdy + (\u2202z/\u2202x - \u2202x/\u2202z) dxdz + (\u2202z/\u2202y - \u2202y/\u2202z) dydz We need to find these partial derivatives: \u2202y/\u2202x = 3t/2 \u2202x/\u2202y = 2/(3t) \u2202z/\u2202x = 2t \u2202x/\u2202z = 1/(2t\u00b2) \u2202z/\u2202y = 4t/3 \u2202y/\u2202z = 3/(4t) Substituting these into the surface integral: \u222cS (3t/2 - 2/(3t)) dxdy + (2t - 1/(2t\u00b2)) dxdz + (4t/3 - 3/(4t)) dydz Now, we need to change the variables from x, y, z to t. The Jacobian of this transformation is: J = |dx/dt  dy/dt  dz/dt| = |2t  3t\u00b2  4t\u00b3| = 24t\u2075 So our integral becomes: \u222b0\u00b9 [(3t/2 - 2/(3t)) + (2t - 1/(2t\u00b2)) + (4t/3 - 3/(4t))] * 24t\u2075 dt Simplifying: 24 \u222b0\u00b9 (3t\u2076/2 - 2t\u2074/3 + 2t\u2076 - t\u00b3/2 + 4t\u2076/3 - 3t\u2074/4) dt Integrating: 24 [(3t\u2077/14) - (2t\u2075/15) + (2t\u2077/7) - (t\u2074/8) + (4t\u2077/21) - (3t\u2075/20)]0\u00b9 Evaluating from 0 to 1: 24 [(3/14) - (2/15) + (2/7) - (1/8) + (4/21) - (3/20)] Simplifying this fraction gives us 33/20.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "Ugx4Bb6wpsNJO7mmFyJ4AaABAg.9ubrWbbvBNeA6NyN8MdtZW", "comment": "\u00a0@anonymoususerinterface\u00a0 claude is the goat", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "Ugx4Bb6wpsNJO7mmFyJ4AaABAg.9ubrWbbvBNeA6PGHM17M8l", "comment": "\u00a0@anonymoususerinterface\u00a0 You are my savior tysm", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "UgxJHaGx9L80OAint1t4AaABAg.9tM5aq3LZut9tuxlOfiVXy", "comment": "i  got the same  are we wrong wrong video", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "Ugy-aEjfgZmhHrxE8_d4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks, you saved my day again!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "Ugzy09TJRev1d7OugcJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Good explanation, but I think you need to change the limit of integration because you are integrating with respect to u", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "Ugw1ioC-pelSQpGd5MZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Good and enough explanation....", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "Ugyto8dqJsrNUnPwvZJ4AaABAg", "comment": "love you so much David", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "UgzGhwIoA8GUcYosl594AaABAg", "comment": "for 2) i got 3/2 instead of 33/20", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Tz14rC0XvHI", "cid": "UgzHGg7O-wI3z0_V3BJ4AaABAg", "comment": "That was surprisingly clear.

Therefore the area under the curve is   $(a, b) $(0,y) dy dx  Simplifying the innermost integral, you have,  $(a, b) (y - 0) dx or  $(a, b) y dx  Substituting f(x) for y because y = f(x),  $(a, b) f(x) dx  And there you have it!
