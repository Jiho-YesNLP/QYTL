One that I will mention that is way off is you stated without compression, streaming videos on Youtube would not be possible.  First of all, compression is only effective if the originally stored data format is INefficient.   If you have code that generates output in an efficient manner, then little or no compression is needed.  For example, if a camera ONLY outputs JPG files at reasonable filesizes (about 0.3 bytes per pixel), then no additional compression is needed as those are probably small enough to send via internet to family and friends and should have good quality.  Another wrong thing you said is smaller data files (as a result of greater compression) result in more lost data and worse quality.  That is not necessarily true.  Algorithm A might compress a file 10:1 whereas algorithm B might compress that same (input) file 12:1, however B might be better quality with LESS lost data.  It depends on the quality of the compression algorithm (and other factors).  You cannot make a blanket statement that smaller compressed file are of worse (lower) quality than larger ones cuz that is not always true (although it is many times (usually) true).  Also data compression is a mathematical thing, not Computer Science.  A compression algorithm can be defined on paper mathematically, without even one line of computer code.  Whether or not it is implemented on a computer is irrelevant to the fact that it was defined mathematically.

It would be like lowering the resolution or contrast on an image file. It's not data compression.   Lossy compression specifically relates to algorithms that detect repeated information, and removes the information which has a lower occurrence or significance to perception. In relation to audio, this is done using a manipulation of the fact that the tuned receptors in our ears are stimulated rather coarsely (critical bands), and we can rather crudely simplify a repeated waveform (eg. a harmonically generated sound) before we perceive a loss of quality.
