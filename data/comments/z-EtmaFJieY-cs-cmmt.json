The simplicity with which you explain complex topics is really praiseworthy. Please keep up the good work.  May we have a video on System Design (description of the system along with interaction among the various system components) or Architecture of some of the modern web based applications such as Facebook, Uber etc or enterprise products such as Oracle Database, Oracle EBS etc?

The problem is, we are too noisy, influenced by so many miniscule things and also chaotic, unpredictable. A machine is being influenced purely by its data input.

Input 1 * weight 1 + input 2 * weight 2 + input 3 * weight 3 = output. This is the equation for a 3 dimensional plane in Cartesian space. If the output is positive, we are on one side of the plane. If the output is negative, we are on the other side. The equation becomes more complicated and less linear with multiple layers, but the concept is the same. We're splitting the data using multiplication and addition, like she did graphically in the video.   If we have multiple outputs, we have multiple planes splitting the data. One plane splits things into stuff that looks like a lunar moth and stuff that doesn't. Another plate splits things into stuff that looks like an emperor moth and stuff that doesn't. These planes could line up but be oriented opposite directions (like she had graphically in the video, one line to split two dimensional data). You could then make the decision based on if the output was positive or negative. That would work.  You can do a binary classifier with just one output. But, in her example, we've got two outputs, so we've got two planes.   Ideally, only one output will be positive at a time. The emperor moth output shouldn't be positive with a lunar moth input because a moth can't both be a lunar moth and an emperor moth. But, if both are positive or both are negative, one of your outputs got it wrong. The magnitude can be thought of as the confidence (how far were we from where we split the data?).

For any program, there are two possibilities. Either it works exactly as intended, of some bug crops up in the code. In the first case, we probably have nothing to fear. The latter case isn't terribly concerning, either. Computer code is much like genetic code; changes are more likely to cause garbage to pour out than any kind of coherent alteration, and even those alterations are guaranteed to be slight tweaks on existing functions. The worst we have to worry about is the AI equivalent of people getting sickle-cell anemia, not people turning into zombies. You might argue that evolution has produced incredible results from random mutations, and you'd be half-right. However, you'd also be half-wrong. Mutations alone do not turn bacteria into butterflies and monkeys into men; that requires mutations plus natural selection over countless generations. But computer programs don't reproduce the way natural organisms do. They, like sterile fruit trees, are only propagated by human action. The code which is most useful to humans is kept and tweaked, whether that code is binary or genetic. The only thing we have to fear is, again, that the selectors make decisions which are bad for humanity. And, okay, that's a concern.
