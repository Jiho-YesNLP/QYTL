A magnet or rather a permanent magnet is created by aligning all the \u2018magnets\u2019 with a massive electro magnetic charge.  Let\u2019s simplify. The lowest form of matter is a proton. This proton is actually a large amount of energy that has undergone the process of cohesion. When the energy undergoes coherence it transforms into matter plus gives off heat. We see this everyday, it is our sun and it is a fusion reactor.  A proton is stable and that stability is the direct result of magnetism. The proton is the universes smallest stable magnet.  Magnetism does not exist on its own, as that is not possible, magnetism and the dielectric are a dynamic system. The dielectric simply put is charge or capacitance. The dielectric is the property of this dynamic system that attracts and stores charge.   When we talk about magnetism we think of attraction which is not the case at all. Magnetism is radiant or better put expands and pushes everything out of its way. A magnetic discharge or field is created by the dielectric discharging because it has stored to much energy and needs to release it. By doing this a magnetic discharge is created which brings the proton closer to its resting stage.  But that is not all.   When a magnet is put under viewing film or if iron filings are used to see the magnetic field lines we are actually seeing the iron particles aligning themselves towards the poles. And the poles are a dielectric vortex just like a water vortex sucking in water. Now this is where things get interesting it is not the poles which discharge too much dielectric it is the inertial plane, or the Bloch wall.  Charge, discharge, charge, discharge and at the same time the \u2018vortexes\u2019 are pulling or attracting.  Everything in the universe is of magnets and how they interplay with each other. Energy and matter are made of the same thing the only difference is that matter is coherent and because it is coherent it has totally different characteristics. Such as mass and therefor gravity. And gravity is actually the magnets vortex and it all starts as a proton, the lowest stable form of matter.

If things are listed it's probably a key point and should be remembered easily. 2. Pause the video in between ideas to process what she had went over, repeat to yourself key ideas 3. When they show a diagram or chart of some sort, try to study it and go over the things they are talking about in it. 4.

Take for example they invented soap and used it in their bathrooms. Take for example they invented distillation and used it to distill a potent alcoholic drink they called Tequila (strong or heavy in Arabic :-) ). Take for example some of their manuscripts show them in glass containers diving into extremely deep in the ocean illustrating deep sea fish that exists like 3000 thousand feet down.

Remember that, even though electrons move at drift speed, current travels near the speed of light which means Special Relativity takes place. The magnetic field causes, according to Maxwell's fourth equation, a changing electric field that will induce a magnetic field around a close loop. All particles have an intrinsic property known as spin that defines its magnetic properties, all of which are caused due to relative motion. It may have spin angular momentum (on its own) or orbital angular momentum (such as electrons orbiting nucleons). We mostly look at electrons because their magnetic dipole moments are thousands of times greater than protons or neutrons.  Before I move on, in quantum physics, we can only measure one component which are quantized. For the z direction, the spin / orbital angular momentum is proportional to its spin. For an electron, through experimentations, half of the time an electron will have a downward dipole moment, and the other half of the time an electron will have an upward dipole moment. Thus, we conclude that the spin of an electron is plus or minus 1/2. When the electron is spin-up, its spin is +1/2. When the electron is spin-down, its spin is -1/2.  The magnetic dipole moments are vectors and thus have an associated direction. Due to random disperse of electrons in all different directions, they tend to cancel out making most materials not magnetic. Let's look at Chemistry for a second at electron orbitals. Remember that electrons like to pair? Spin-up electrons like to pair with spin-down electrons; that's how bonding happens. Materials are magnetic only if the combination of all the magnetic dipoles line up to produce a magnetic field, and, as you can tell, this would never spontaneously happen. However, due to chemical properties, it is possible for some materials to be permanently magnetic while others could only be temporarily magnetic.  There are three types of magnetic materials. Let's start with Diamagnetism. This occurs when most of the electrons are paired up in a material. This is the weakest type of magnetism, and all of us (you, me, wooden chairs, etc) are diamagnetic because our electrons are, for the most part, paired up. Have you ever seen a frog levitate due to magnetism? That frog is experiencing diamagnetism. Basically, an external magnetic field is applying a magnetic force on the object away from the source of the magnetic force. That magnetic field induces the electrons in the material to line up, causing it to be magnetic. However, the magnetic field induced in the diamagnetic material opposes the external magnetic field. This pushes the diamagnetic material (e.g. the frog) away to a less magnetic field (like the air). However, diamagnetic materials are only temporarily magnetic. Once you remove the magnetic field, diamagnetic materials lose all magnetic properties.  Next is paramagnetism. Remember what I was saying about unpaired electrons? This is why some elements like the Noble Gases or sodium ions are least magnetic because they have a stable set of paired electrons. Surprisingly, this shows that carbon is more magnetic than fluorine (interesting organic properties). However, if we look at the elements where there are the most unpaired electrons such as the rare earth, actinide, or transition metals, we can see that they are in between full sets of electron orbitals and thus have TONS of unpaired electrons. (Look at iron! It's in the middle of the transition metals, and even though it has 4 levels, it has 4 unpaired electrons hidden in the 3rd level which resists bonding!) Again, an external magnetic field can orient these unpaired electrons to make such materials magnetic and induce their own magnetic field. However, unlike diamagnetic materials whose magnetic fields fight against the external magnetic field, paramagnetic induced magnetic fields actually add up with the external magnetic field to attract to a higher magnetic field. However, like diamagnetic materials, once you remove the external magnetic field, the paramagnetic materials lose their magnetic properties. This explains why you can't make permanent magnets out of most elements like carbon or oxygen.  The last class is ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetic materials are a special type of paramagnetic materials in that, once an external magnetic field is applied, the dipole moments permanently line up forming a permanent magnet. Ferromagnetic materials are typically materials like iron, cobalt, nickel, germanium, and several other materials. This is because their materials are typically arranged in domains. Each domain has their dipole moments arranged in a single direction; however, each domain faces a different direction causing their to be no net magnetic field normally. Once the external magnetic field is introduced, these domains in iron or cobalt line up resulting in permanent magnets. One final note is that increasing the temperature will cause a material to lose its magnetic properties due to quantum effects, but I'm sure you can imagine that increasing the temperature would cause dipole moments to move in all sorts of directions which would ultimately lead to lose such magnetic properties.  What I have just explained is why magnets exist in the way they do. If you want to understand how magnets attract, I'm sure you can easily deduct that from this video. A magnet produces magnetic field lines, similar to electric field lines. Once a magnet detects another set of magnetic field lines, they either repel or attract like charges. Magnetic field lines come out of the North end and come into the South end. (This explains why magnetic monopoles can't exist. The field lines are always coming in from somewhere and coming out the other end. When you cut a magnet, field lines regardless come in from one end and exit the other end.) So when you place a North next to a South, the field lines of the North want to come into the South, so they push toward each other. Similarly, a North and a North are both pushing their field lines away from each other.  Is there anything else you would like me to explain or clarify?

I couldn't break down absolutely everything or else I'd have to publish a book. I'm writing that response under the assumption that Magnetism is Electricity undergoing relativistic effects due to current traveling near the speed of light. It's more than that, but it's a good way to think about that when getting introduced.  In case anyone doesn't know what Special Relativity is, for a quick and simple understanding, we will assume a postulate such that no objects could travel greater than the speed of light. If we were to use classical mechanics, then we would run into a dilemma where there would be reference frames where the velocity of an object would exceed the speed of light, which is impossible. Thus, we must change our formulas to take into account such changes through Lorentz transformations. This leads to weird consequences such as length contraction and time dilation which all account for the existence of magnetism. For a better explanation on Special Relativity, see Khan Academy.

I just wasn't clear enough in my answer.  The question of whether the magnetic field curls around in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction is strictly a sign convention.  It's not actually physical.  What's going on is that the magnetic field isn't actually a vector.  It's what's called a \"pseudovector.\"  More generically (which matters if we want to talk about space with a number of dimensions different from 3) it's the dual of a bivector.  It happens that, in three dimensions, this will be a three-component object, just like a vector.  But, in other numbers of dimensions, the number of components is different.  In 2D, a magnetic field only has one component, while in 4D, it has six.  Anyway, the point of all this is that the interpretation of directionality for a magnetic field has an ambiguity in a way that other things don't.  There's no ambiguity about the direction of a force or a velocity, say; but, the direction of a magnetic field isn't directly measurable in the same way.  And, the math connecting magnetic fields to their sources and effects involves the vector cross-product, which is where the sign convention that the right hand rule summarizes comes in.

And, the overall sign ambiguity doesn't mean that relative sign differences aren't real.  Whichever way the field points, like magnetic poles will still repel and opposite poles will attract.  2) That would be true if the magnetic field were a vector.  It isn't.  Think about it this way.  In 3D, the force created by a magnetic field is perpendicular to both the field and the direction of motion of the object affected.  That can't happen with less than three dimensions (unless the field and direction of motion are in the same direction; but, then the magnitude of the force is 0).  The way magnetic fields actually work is that they have a component associated with each pair of directions in space.  So, in 2D, there's just one component (it's like if you only had a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane in which things are confined).

So many things in physics make so much more sense when you see them through calculus.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s94suB5uLWw", "cid": "Ugij_tQ8eOvEA3gCoAEC.8Lylv_DjXHX8Mgv14e37gd", "comment": "Patrick Melody Just like you don't understand physics, you obviously don't understand grammer. 1st example : Your use of double negatives in your comment.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s94suB5uLWw", "cid": "Ugij_tQ8eOvEA3gCoAEC.8Lylv_DjXHX8Mh3YogtAgg", "comment": "Uh oh I sense a high dose of sodium chloride.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "s94suB5uLWw", "cid": "Ugij_tQ8eOvEA3gCoAEC.8Lylv_DjXHX8NQLPEX5edg", "comment": "I c&p this from another comment I replied to. (This is my explanation.)  When particles are in relative motion, they induce a magnetic field.  Remember that, even though electrons move at drift speed, current  travels near the speed of light which means Special Relativity takes  place. The magnetic field causes, according to Maxwell's fourth  equation, a changing electric field that will induce a magnetic field  around a close loop. All particles have an intrinsic property known as  spin that defines its magnetic properties, all of which are caused due  to relative motion. It may have spin angular momentum (on its own) or  orbital angular momentum (such as electrons orbiting nucleons). We  mostly look at electrons because their magnetic dipole moments are  thousands of times greater than protons or neutrons.  Before I move on,  in quantum physics, we can only measure one component which are  quantized. For the z direction, the spin / orbital angular momentum is  proportional to its spin. For an electron, through experimentations,  half of the time an electron will have a downward dipole moment, and the other half of the time an electron will have an upward dipole moment. Thus, we conclude that the spin of an electron is plus or minus 1/2.  When the electron is spin-up, its spin is +1/2. When the electron is spin-down, its spin is -1/2.  The magnetic dipole moments are vectors and thus have an associated direction. Due to random disperse of electrons in all different directions, they tend to cancel out making most materials not magnetic. Let's look at Chemistry for a second at electron orbitals. Remember that electrons like to pair? Spin-up electrons like to pair with spin-down electrons; that's how bonding happens. Materials are magnetic only if the combination of all the magnetic dipoles line up to produce a magnetic field, and, as you can tell, this would never spontaneously happen. However, due to chemical properties, it is possible for some materials to be permanently magnetic while others could only be temporarily magnetic.  There are three types of magnetic materials. Let's start with  Diamagnetism. This occurs when most of the electrons are paired up in a material. This is the weakest type of magnetism, and all of us (you, me, wooden chairs, etc) are diamagnetic because our electrons are, for the most part, paired up. Have you ever seen a frog levitate due to  magnetism? That frog is experiencing diamagnetism. Basically, an  external magnetic field is applying a magnetic force on the object away  from the source of the magnetic force. That magnetic field induces the  electrons in the material to line up, causing it to be magnetic. However, the magnetic field induced in the diamagnetic material opposes the external magnetic field. This pushes the diamagnetic material (e.g.  the frog) away to a less magnetic field (like the air). However, diamagnetic materials are only temporarily magnetic. Once you remove the magnetic field, diamagnetic materials lose all magnetic properties.  Next is paramagnetism. Remember what I was saying about unpaired  electrons? This is why some elements like the Noble Gases or sodium ions are least magnetic because they have a stable set of paired electrons. Surprisingly, this shows that carbon is more magnetic than fluorine (interesting organic properties). However, if we look at the elements where there are the most unpaired electrons such as the rare earth, actinide, or transition metals, we can see that they are in between full sets of electron orbitals and thus have TONS of unpaired electrons. (Look at iron! It's in the middle of the transition metals, and even though it has 4 levels, it has 4 unpaired electrons hidden in the 3rd  level which resists bonding!) Again, an external magnetic field can  orient these unpaired electrons to make such materials magnetic and  induce their own magnetic field. However, unlike diamagnetic materials  whose magnetic fields fight against the external magnetic field,  paramagnetic induced magnetic fields actually add up with the external  magnetic field to attract to a higher magnetic field. However, like  diamagnetic materials, once you remove the external magnetic field, the paramagnetic materials lose their magnetic properties. This explains why you can't make permanent magnets out of most elements like carbon or oxygen.  The last class is ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetic materials are a special type of paramagnetic materials in that, once an external magnetic field is applied, the dipole moments permanently line up forming a permanent magnet. Ferromagnetic materials are typically materials like iron, cobalt, nickel, germanium, and several other materials. This is because their materials are typically arranged in domains. Each domain has their dipole moments arranged in a single direction; however, each domain faces a different direction causing their to be no net magnetic field normally. Once the external magnetic field is introduced, these domains in iron or cobalt line up resulting in permanent magnets. One final note is that increasing the temperature will cause a material to lose its magnetic properties due to quantum effects, but I'm sure you can imagine that increasing the temperature would cause dipole moments to move in all sorts of directions which would ultimately lead to lose such magnetic properties.  What I have just explained is why magnets exist in the way they do. If  you want to understand how magnets attract, I'm sure you can easily  deduct that from this video. A magnet produces magnetic field lines,  similar to electric field lines. Once a magnet detects another set of  magnetic field lines, they either repel or attract like charges.  Magnetic field lines come out of the North end and come into the South  end. (This explains why magnetic monopoles can't exist. The field lines  are always coming in from somewhere and coming out the other end. When you cut a magnet, field lines regardless come in from one end and exit the other end.) So when you place a North next to a South, the field lines of the North want to come into the South, so they push toward each other. Similarly, a North and a North are both pushing their field lines away from each other.  Is there anything else you would like me to explain or clarify?

If you have a positive and negative point charges next to eachother you should notice how they interact fairly similarly to magnets. I suggest a quick google image search of  Electric Dipoles to show the similarities.

Then I think potentially we have something called a meta field that opens up a whole array of applications that don't depend on energy transmutation for application. One of these I believe would effectively be a lightsaber. However I suspect the light would be no more then a refractive anomaly and the field itself would be the blade if you will.   That said I'm fully aware of the speculative nature of my supposition, that any practical application of this is probably far beyond the utility of my utilizing this energy to put forth the speculative analysis.
