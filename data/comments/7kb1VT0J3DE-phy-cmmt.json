I can't really blame Crash Course in particular, as it's a very common explanation, but it's wrong.  Light is always a wave and it's always a particle.  The thing to realize is that it's never a classical particle.  In quantum mechanics, the word \"particle\" has a very specific meaning -- it's just shorthand for \"localized wave function.\"  Essentially, a quantum particle is just a tiny wave.  A very tiny wave, which is why it often acts like what we think of classical particles.  But it's never actually a classical particle.  It's always a wave.  What the photo-electric effect proved is that light was quantized -- that means it's a particle in the quantum mechanics sense of the word, but honestly, sometimes it's just easier to forget about particles altogether, because the word has such a strong connotation of \"tiny solid sphere\", at least for me.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgyMAKV5w_Ayhe6caaN4AaABAg", "comment": "Great vid", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "Ugy_KDiaWqa247uAgfx4AaABAg", "comment": "I love this mam", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgzAAaHZN-vjrD4rXed4AaABAg", "comment": "black bodies exist, theyre called blackholes", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "Ugy5umjpymGspEJPy-V4AaABAg", "comment": "Did Shini just say haych?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgzHfeKMG0JRa8taLCJ4AaABAg", "comment": "her british accent uhhhh", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgxV0eM1ioD9LdUjN9t4AaABAg", "comment": "I have a got a lot of crazy answers from your channel....

According to the internet \"electromagnetic force\" holds the protons of the nucleus and electrons together while kinetic force of the electrons pulls them apart. But isnt this just general relativity?  As in; at first sight electrons and protons dont appear to be perfect opposites because an electron behaves differently (whizzing around outside the nucleus) and is also 1832 times less massive. But its energy is also comparably more massive than the proton per unit mass (MEv)  This is in line with the Energy - mass equivalence (E=mc2) suggesting that an electron is the antithesis of a proton but one has converted the majority of its mass to energy (electron), the other remains mainly mass and less energy.  So what is electromagnetic force? And assuming the the electron uncertainty cloud could be \"cooled\" to a state of equal mass/ energy as the proton (reducing its ability to stay away from the proton - kinetic energy) would they come together and annihilate eachother?

Particle physicist here.  I doubt I'll answer everything you asked, but let me give point you to a few things that you might want to look at.  So, particles do, in fact, have \"opposites\"; we call them antiparticles.  The electron's antiparticle is called a positron; the proton's antiparticle is an antiproton.  If an electron meets a positron, they can annihilate.  If a proton meets an antiproton, they can annihilate.  (In either case, they annihilate and you can get really cool stuff come out--that's what particle accelerators do!)  As for the equation E=mc^2, that's actually only true for a particle at rest!  If a particle is moving, with momentum p, its energy is actually given by E^2=(mc^2)^2+(cp)^2.  (Notice that if p=0, for a particle at rest, you get E=mc^2 back.)  So, a moving electron doesn't convert its mass into energy; instead, it has energy from its mass and from the fact that it's whizzing around.  (And, also, there's potential energy because it's close to the nucleus.)  Hope that helps.  You might want to check out a few videos on my channel; most of my stuff is about statistics, but I've got a video on discovery of the bottom quark, one on the discovery of the tau lepton, one on the Z boson, and one that talks a bit about grand unified theories--maybe you'd find them interesting.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgxhqIf6mbrmcnXhCsR4AaABAg", "comment": "Day Two of this 8 minute video....", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "Ugx1TlpbBSGIs_SwmA94AaABAg", "comment": "... what", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgyTY20f9tPXwk7KZbB4AaABAg", "comment": "You speak very fast, i think you must consider that people that watch this video, they are not only natives speaker but also people living overseas", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgwKkWKc7LbFnhyi4G54AaABAg", "comment": "I Got Lost in YouTube Again..!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgzFlTRCXdbqEXuyNMF4AaABAg", "comment": "what is rayleigh jeans law? does he wear jeans?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7kb1VT0J3DE", "cid": "UgwSRjWBzHgzUI_YNqJ4AaABAg", "comment": "BROOOO she lost me from 2:10 seconds in,  i literally have no idea whatttt she is talking about from then on lol.

In fact the energy required to make an observation is enough to cause the state change.   In the \"Free Flow\" state they exhibit the properties of a wave, when that state is interrupted by any external field the state changes. In a static system a simple ruler or a bounced beam is enough to make measurements.    In a dynamic system the measurement requires a change in the kinetic energy of the system.   Even the radar used to measure a car's velocity has a slight (although minuscule) effect.     In a free flowing liquid the introduction of a point restriction ( dip a stick into a smooth flowing creek) causes eddy currents that alternate from side to side.  This can be used to measure the flow rate, but only to a point.   If the flow rate is to slow it will not produce eddy currents.  The change of the rate of flow that produces eddy currents is a state change of the system.   Of course we can explain in detail why and how this state change occurs but the fact remains that the introduction of any point restriction into a free flowing fluid will cause eddy currents if the energy level is sufficient.  What is the maximum size of particles that will conform to the double slit experiment in a zero G environment?? What happens in both of these experiments when they are in a super cooled environment?

This idea is based on: (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e with energy \u2206E equals mass \u2206M linked to the Lorentz contraction \u02e0 of space and time. The Lorentz contraction \u02e0 represents the time dilation of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. We have energy \u2206E slowing the rate that time \u2206t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c\u00b2 represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4\u03c0 of EMR from its radius forming a square c\u00b2 of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0.

In such a theory we have an emergent future unfolding photon by photon with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields.

Physics at all scales is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics (assuming here that quantum mechanics is the correct description of nature).

There's no difference between sub atomic mechanic and larger scale logic.  You just have to understand that \"random\" and \"free will\" both describe the same phenomenon (the first one is from a \"viewer\" POV and the latter from the \"actor\" POV).  So basically if you looked at the earth from a distant POV and with a time scale way faster: you would see that components of earth (humans for example, but seen as millions and over century seeming as minutes) have a very predictable behavior (look at history of humanity), but if you look closer, each human seem to behave randomly and are hard to predict (they even think they have free will).  The big mystery in all that is that we are all connected unconsciously and when we think we do think under our own free will, we actually behave in a fake random/free-will way which actually balance the univers energy.  Also, there is no wave/particle duality for the simple reason that there is not such a think as \"particle\". The idea of particle is just a leftover of a misconception induced by our senses (mainly vision).

The ONLY wavy thing is the \"mathematical tool\" you use to describe this probability of being somewhere or somewhere else. Particle dont move together to form a wave (unlike water molecules).  Be careful when you hear words like \"particle is a wave\" or \"behaves like a wave\", its a misuse of language (due to historical reasons... the guys at the beginning  of 20th century had some difficulties to find appropriate words to tell quantum effects, so they used pictures from classical physics... and these words stayed in spite of the new perspective gained the last 50 years).  So what is important to understand is that a physical theory only gives us a way to view a specific part of the world (quantum mechanics cares about small things isolated from the rest of the world and observed with a big apparatus).  The main lesson of quantum mechanics is that IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING to say things like \"photon are like this or like that\" and to imagine these particle as small balls that behave weirdly sometimes.   The quantum way to see the world is only about the INFORMATION you can acquire about the world, given the tools you're going to use to look at it. If you use a certain tool in a certain way (light or electrical current or a magnet etc...) then you will only be able to acquire a certain type of  information about the particle you're \"looking at\" with these objects. This vision may seem disappointing or too restrictive to give a good description of the world... and in fact not at all ! It gives the most precise description of the world we've ever had and more than that, it's the only way to understand the microscopic world ! Are you giddy ?

To make the photon, the wave with a localized bulge, you have to add up a lot of other waves of different frequencies to get them to cancel out in the right places. If you added up an infinite number of them with an infinite number of different frequencies, I think you could get the dirac delta function and the photon would literally be a point. Usually, it's not so extreme and its shown as just a single peak that gradually flattens out over a few cycles (that means the photon could \"be\" anywhere in that space where the amplitude is nonzero). As you saw in the video, a photon's energy depends on its frequency. So if you add up infinite frequencies to pin down the location at one point, you have absolutely no idea which of those represents the energy of the photon.

An excitation of higher energy in comparison to the vacuum state, if you will. And time is the rate of permeation of said excitations.   I could never understand physics until I understand this simple fact. I feel that people need to understand how things truly work at the most basic of levels to ever hope to grasp reality. If you don't explain this, you are explaining it wrong. All analogies give you a misconstrued viewpoint of reality that is hard to overcome.   Example: the double slit experiment is solved if you realize that the photon IS the field, not the particle. So when the excitation of the field travels through the slit (which, in of itself, is composed of excitations), a piece of the field itself is traveling through both slits, as the field is everywhere. The only thing separating space is the rate of permeation. Particles are higher energy in said field, and this energy is NOT constant. It is spread out through all the universe, but focused into a 'point' that is not purely localized. This is why we think of particles in probabilities. It all makes sense. Perfect sense. But you have to change how you think about physics.   I am myself a laymen, but starting with the classic explanation instead of going straight to the quantum field explanation only confuses things for everyone.

We don't know what causes light to go from wave to particle, we don't know how quantum systems go into classical systems (decoherence) and, QFT even worse, it's not even mathematically sound (see renormalization).  So it appears that the only things that depend on the small distances  between coupling points are the values for n and j-theoretical numbers  that are not directly obseroable any- way; everything else, which can be  observed, seems not to be affected. The shell game that we play to find  n and j is technically called \"renormalization.\" But no matter how  clever the word, it is what I would call a dippy process! Having to  resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory  of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-consistent. It's  surprising that the theory still hasn't been proved self-consistent one  way or the other by now; I suspect that renormalization is not  mathematically legitimate. What is certain is that we do not have a good  mathematical way to describe the theory of quantum electrodynamics:  such a bunch of words to describe the connection between n and j and m  and e is not good mathematics.
