I have watched almost all of them mainly because you are so concise and funny. You obviously know your stuff and it is evident in how good you are at explaining all of this complex biology stuff. I hope you post again one day because these videos are truly a gem. I have learned 10 times more from you explaining the key concepts of these chapters, than actually trying to understand them myself. Thank you and I hope you are doing well.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
