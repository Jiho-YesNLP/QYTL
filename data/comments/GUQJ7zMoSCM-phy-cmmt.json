EDIT: To add some context to this post a year later, since there have been a few comments about it, I realize this is taught in High School. But I needed to review for a college course (Stochiastics) I didn't actually go to High School. I worked through those years, self studied to get a GED  at age  19 with barely passing grades and continued working. Went back to school age 26 at a Community College while working. So all of this stuff that was covered in High School I never learned, or only learned once through self studying and forgot, and these videos helped me get the concepts quickly when I needed to learn, relearn, and review for other classes.  For those interested, I'm now at a 4 year university (Northeastern) graduating spring 2023 with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Physics.
