In the case of 6x^2 - 13x - 5, you have to factorize the 6, which can be 6 x 1 or 3 x 2 (you only need to determine the positive factors). Because 6 has 2 possible pairs of (positive) factors, you then have to try solutions for both (6x + m)(x + n) and (3x + m)(2x + n) until you find values for m & n that work. It's basically more work than solving simpler quadratics and there's no shortcut.  Problem:  6x^2 - 13x - 5 1. Factorize -5 to get possible pairs of value for m and n:  Either -5 * 1 or 5 * -1 2. Factorize 6 (positives only) to get possible pairs of coefficients for x in the binomials:  Either 6 * 1 or 3 * 2. 3. Express the 6 * 1 option as 2 binomials:  (6x + m)(x + n) 4. Do just the 'OI' in 'FOIL' (i.e. Outer then Inner) to get the equation to solve for m & n:  6n + m = -13. This saves us having to write out the whole equation each time. 5. Try substituting -5 for m and 1 for n:  6 * 1 + (-5)  = 6 - 5  = 1. Nah, not -13. 6. Try substituting -1 for m and 5 for n:  6 * 5 + (-1)  = 30 - 1  =  29. Nah, not -13. 7. Try substituting 5 for m and -1 for n:  6 * (-1) + 5  = -6 + 5  = -1. Nah, not -13. 8. Try substituting 1 for m and -5 for n:  6 * (-5) + 1  = -30 + 1  = -29. Nah, not -13. 9. Express the 3 * 2 option as 2 binomials:  (3x + m)(2x + n) 10. Do just the 'OI' in 'FOIL' (i.e. Outer then Inner) to get the equation to solve for m & n:  3n + 2m = -13 11. Try substituting -5 for m and 1 for n:  3 * 1 + 2 * (-5)  = 3 - 10  = -7. Nah, not -13. 12. Try substituting -1 for m and 5 for n:  3 * 5 + 2 * (-1)  = 15 - 2  = 13. Nah, not -13 13. Try substituting 5 for m and -1 for n:  3 * (-1) + 2 * 5  = -3 + 10  = 7. Nah, not -13. 14. Try substituting 1 for m and -5 for n:  3 * (-5) + 2 * 1  = -15 + 2  = -13. YES! 8th time lucky. 15. So 6x^2 - 13x - 5 factors to (3x + 1)(2x + (-5)) which is (3x + 1)(2x -5) 16. Check by FOIL (First Outer Inner Last): 3x * 2x + 3x * (-5) + 1 * 2x + 1 * (-5)  = 6x^2 + (-15x) + 2x + (-5)  = 6x^2 - 13x - 5", "votes": "63", "replies": "6", "reply": false}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgxeKTCZ0KdheEXM4i54AaABAg", "comment": "Alright bros my brain has finally stopped functioning", "votes": "8", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "Ugz-5ZwGwrLK1pjnFt14AaABAg", "comment": "Love from india", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "Ugya7fPj51-WWe0WTEh4AaABAg", "comment": "im so immensely impressed by how clear your explanations are. i dont know if i'm going to watch the whole playlist but pls add to the series to make this gold accessible.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "Ugw4GAZDK0OS7g8QdLh4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgxysvurKhRscHu9umJ4AaABAg", "comment": "tank  very much you help me to get 100% my maths exam", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgxBNxTkJDkw2KiVcQt4AaABAg.9c-yqlFfMvX9fzOKBPDQB7", "comment": "If i am getting just the sigh wrong then is my ans is also wrong", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgxR7Q2pChPEZIQAybJ4AaABAg.9bLxFvFHwq29xQOeZLm395", "comment": "So, how did you done at your exams?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "Ugwt8CAw_bJGwm1BDMV4AaABAg.9ZqT0n_gamV9j8cFvJboBj", "comment": "No. -2x*1= -2x, 5*-3x = -15x -15x - 2x = -17x -17x is not -13x  Also, 5*1 = 5, there's no positive 5 in 6x\u00b2 - 13x -5 =", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgzGgl2k4Gd2QYiGjO94AaABAg.9YEkEzMSbIN9eCRR6_h6aE", "comment": "Crazy, right?", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgzGgl2k4Gd2QYiGjO94AaABAg.9YEkEzMSbIN9ep-untz1Ll", "comment": "no,it's not. cause, now, while we watch this channel, we already have basics from school, we just ensure and highlight terms that we missed at school.", "votes": "30", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgzGgl2k4Gd2QYiGjO94AaABAg.9YEkEzMSbIN9fjRFsLStsf", "comment": "Ikr each of these lessons is like 4 weeks of schoolwork", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "GuwofNeT9ok", "cid": "UgzGgl2k4Gd2QYiGjO94AaABAg.9YEkEzMSbIN9lPols9jPsM", "comment": "Yeah but not a lot of time to practice though.
