A vector in the form of [[x],[0],[-x]] means that you can put any (real in this case) number in the position of the x, in both the first and final entry of this vector.   So this means that [[4], [0], [-4]] as well as [[-6], [0], [-6]] are vectors of this form.  They have something in common, in that their first and final entries are negatives of each other, and they have zero for the middle entry.  Note that the nested brackets is my way of indicating the vertical matrix, in an inline text description.  Think of the innermost brackets as individual rows, and the outermost bracket as the full matrix of those rows.  In this case, there's just one entry per row, since vectors in linear algebra are considered vertical matrices.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "tM4TDL9Hj8U", "cid": "Ugy9fsR1P8fEjLk73ht4AaABAg.9IcqkjUpUnQ9LquL29Xf1Z", "comment": "he made a video called understanding vector space", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "tM4TDL9Hj8U", "cid": "Ugy9fsR1P8fEjLk73ht4AaABAg.9IcqkjUpUnQ9qINziLxudx", "comment": "The R refers to real numbers.
