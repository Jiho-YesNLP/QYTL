You have a way of natural talent for teaching and I commend you for that!  To answer some of your questions from the videos:  1. Some study techniques I find to be useful include study groups, asking teachers/professors/fellow classmates for assistance before tests and exams, summarizing chapters in your own words after review (if you can't, it may be a hint that you still have room to learn), and overall gaining a better intuition behind the material rather than memorizing formulas.   2. As a freshman in college, I made the mistake of not checking RateMyProfessors to select who I wanted as a Professor to teach the courses I was taking; luckily, I had 4 outstanding Professors that I wouldn't change for the world, even if I was given the opportunity! For this upcoming Spring Semester, I did, however, use the site this time to select Professors for the 5 courses I'm going to take. I've read some reviews on those who have great scorings and reviews on others with lower scorings and I found that it really is helpful to steer you away from teachers that will make learning difficult. I highly recommend taking his advice and using the site because it gives you insight on what the professor has to offer and how things roll in their classroom. For those who are curious, here's the link: https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/  Physics has always been a subject I've loved since I took it in High School and I can't wait to learn more about it through my years in College/University and eventually pursue that degree I've dreamt of for so long!
