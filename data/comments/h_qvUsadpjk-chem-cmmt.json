There is a problem with the element argon and the calcium ion, whose radii are very close since an atomic species whose radius is an estimated value is being compared with ionic species whose values have been determined experimentally by measurements in crystalline networks.

I actually made a point of not covering it in the video as I didn't want to \"get stuck in the weeds.\"  I've embedded this entire playlist on my website and have begun writing some companion material to go with the videos and have a rather robust article that specifically addresses this issue in isoelectronic series (though my radii for Ar, K+ and Ca2+ differ slightly from yours in my graphic). Do you teach Jorge?
