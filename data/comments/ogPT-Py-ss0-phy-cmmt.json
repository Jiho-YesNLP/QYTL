In fact, both may be present simultaneously, as when you drag a metal bar along metal rails with one end of the rails bridged by a resistor and there is a uniform magnetic field in the area between the rails and bar and resistor. Assume, the magnitude of the uniform magnetic field is increasing. The flux is BA, where B is the magnetic field and A the area enclosing it, and the rate of change of the flux is due in part to the change in the magnetic field, and in part to the change in the area enclosed by the changing path. The resistor will heat up!  The equation of the rate of change of flux....without the details of the derivation are = (dB/dt) A\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BLv (Change of B, fixed path)\u00a0\u00a0 (Change of path) The calculation is a bit mysterious. Physically, where did the emf represented by BLv come from if it is not associated with a changing magnetic field? Befire we provide an answer, it would be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level. Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two as in the following two videos: i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and  ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   Now, returning to the experiment of the moving bar on rails,\u00a0 we see that we have a conducting metal bar and we are moving it. Note carefully that we are moving the jumpy energetic conduction band electrons in it as well. As a result of the magnetic force (due to the presence of the uniform magnetic field), the free electron sea shifted, and the bar polarized and a Coulomb electric field develops and that is how an induced emf is produced.   It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the process of polarization and the consequent production of an emf. The last frame References in video #1\u00a0 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss these topics in more detail using a unified approach and provide an intuitive understanding of the generation of an emf in generators and motors.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgxZkCBoIKjGIJfYkQZ4AaABAg", "comment": "How is there an electric field in the rod if its a conductor (E=0)?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgzLylBhmX_ngqpMfN54AaABAg", "comment": "I love your video, thank you so much!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgwchJ-Lk_KJJK9FUZh4AaABAg", "comment": "I love these videos", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "Ugx4Yz_TWixwvs_r7jl4AaABAg", "comment": "I find this video has less comments and likes, which means that less people are taking this hard course and I am proud of myself that im challenging myself lol", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgwU8wLjYuxHghUEhh14AaABAg", "comment": "Conducting rectangular coil moving across a uniform magnetic field into inside leaving", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgyvNWfm9D6gxcRpTsV4AaABAg", "comment": "One day a new Einstein\\Marie Currie will appear and as they talk to the press about their invention they will mention how they watched this channel extensively.", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgzNgSYpOUHdsx1M3Up4AaABAg", "comment": "To the person who disliked: I will find you", "votes": "39", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "Ugz09hv5-SW-j-Gkn6d4AaABAg", "comment": "I watch every single ad which runs through your videos, I wish all people watching do so... love u so much ur really helping me a lot!!", "votes": "25", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "Ugx7iLTMBLL0RfT7szJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Merci", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "Ugzob3_4cfHLtXBTJ_N4AaABAg", "comment": "Newton bless you for making this video for only 4k veiws and 35 likes... its true... not of heroes DO wear capes", "votes": "21", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgzeAPa90L8pudrNkBB4AaABAg", "comment": "This\u2019s so hard \ud83d\ude3f", "votes": "8", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ogPT-Py-ss0", "cid": "UgwU8wLjYuxHghUEhh14AaABAg.97v1LBbetKX9EC-jw2i9hX", "comment": "Was confused about what he meant by \"face of the coil\".
