However I do have a question about the last problem. The sum is 23. There are two sigfigs in 23. But what if after rounding the units place had a zero (i.e. rounding the sum yields 20) and the sigfigs have essentially been reduced to 1 since the zero is a trailing zero with no decimal? Should the decimal be included or not?", "votes": "1", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "Ugz7bEvOlZQtYKAsrlt4AaABAg", "comment": "thx", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgyVVoVpBca5Gydinrt4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgyN2H-1J1nK6AldY-t4AaABAg", "comment": "What about 11.02??", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgyGm2rRqINBQeDr67N4AaABAg", "comment": "am i the only one who screamed \u201cGPA 4.0 LETS GO\u201d after watchingn", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgwvLxOZiiIyzYjSh2J4AaABAg", "comment": "nice", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgxsvNANdRZvBDN_Bxl4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks \ud83d\udc4d", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgzHIlyehDm5lkDUemV4AaABAg", "comment": "what if it's 5? how do you decide?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgyRZBPlOOfXBqjf2yB4AaABAg", "comment": "You never fail to save me\ud83d\ude0c", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "Ugyfz7sXhHKYYzua8r94AaABAg", "comment": "very clear, concise, straight to the point! the best vid.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "Ugwe-RWmOdCERMdN83B4AaABAg", "comment": "Tyyyyyy I was struggling my physics exam.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "Ugy3y9cK0j4FPpLIaTl4AaABAg", "comment": "This really helped me thank u", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "Ugy18KYz1icbPcbSmEt4AaABAg", "comment": "In 500 how there is only one significant figure 5", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgwKhYEqDlhi1hnluPp4AaABAg", "comment": "The rule in terms of multiplication and division does not hold for 101\u00f799.why pls?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "l2yuDvwYq5g", "cid": "UgxsHMH5KFpXblR4PwV4AaABAg", "comment": "Very nice!

It is greater than five so I round by incrementing the units place by one. The rounded answer is 20. My question is \"is the zero in the result of 20 a sigfig\"?
