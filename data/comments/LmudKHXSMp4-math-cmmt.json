Then I looked up into YouTube so that I can find a tutorial or course where from I can learn the basics of Math and then head to advanced concepts. Then I found this genius' channel. First, I thought that it'd be a simple tutorial like we always find in YouTube. But I started to follow this series and I'm glad for that. I found an elegant beauty in Mathematics and started to love it. Math seemed interesting than ever!!! I also started to get better marks in Mathematics! I don't know how I can thank you.
