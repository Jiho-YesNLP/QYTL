Moreover, the entire conductor surface is now positively charged and generates an electric field to the outside...

The duration of the audio pause during the cut is similar to that of the space between words being spoken. So although it's a new sentence, it's jarring because linguistically it does not sound like a new sentence. And this continues constantly throughout the video. I know that the idea is to keep things fast and exciting, and this technique works great for entertainment Vlogs, but it doesn't work so well in teaching physics. The net effect after a few minutes of the fast cuts is viewer exhaustion. It's like a never ending sentence that is being spoken. I'd recommend changing the editing technique.
