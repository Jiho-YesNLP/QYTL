I believe that one of your examples is incorrect. At 6:36 you say,  \u2018We already know that time moves faster for you than for Bob. Whilst 666 nS has passed for Bob, only 577 nS passed for you.\u2019 These two sentences are contradictory. If \u2018time moves faster for you than Bob\u2019, then the amount of time elapsed for you (person on the platform) must be greater than for Bob. The time elapsed for the observer on the platform should be 769ns, not 577ns. This is also consistent with the twin\u2019s paradox and the idea that \u2018a moving clock runs slow\u2019. From the twins paradox, we expect the observer on the fast moving object (in this case, the train) to age less than the stationary observer (person on platform). Thus, time elapsed for Bob on the train must be less than for the person on the platform. From, \u2018a moving clock runs slow\u2019, we also anticipate that Bob\u2019s recorded time will be less than that recorded from the platform.

Every single video about the theory of relativity explains it using the same analogy. Alex is inside a train, moving really fast (let's say half the speed of light), and Bill is watching from a station.  Now, both of them shoot a laser beam to a mirror one meter in front of them, horizontally. Because Alex is moving, Bill would see Alex's beam moving diagonally instead.  Therefore, Alex's beam must travel a longer distance to reach the same meter, but because the speed of light must always be constant, time slows down for Alex instead.  My question... Idk if I visualize it wrong.  So, if Alex's time has slowed down, and Alex is punching his face inside the train, Bill would see Alex punching his face really slowly, even tho Alex is travelling faster in space?  Now, let's say Bill is als punching himself in the face, and Alex is watching from the train, he would see Bill punching himself really quickly? Why is Bill moving quicker than Alex even tho Alex is the one moving at half the speed of light?  Isn't that different from what we see in movie scenes with speedsters? Like in X-Men Days of Future Past, Quicksilver is the one moving really fast, and the other people are the ones stopping in time.  Time dilation explains the opposite. If Quicksilver is moving really fast and he obeys the special relativity, he would see the other people around him moving faster instead.  Or, am I wrong at understanding this? Please tell me why.

However, note that m is the mass of the object as measured by a person at rest relative to the object. Thus, m is defined to be the rest mass, which could be measured at rest, perhaps using gravity. When a mass is moving relative to an observer, the only way that its mass can be determined is through collisions or other means involving momentum.

Lemme see if I can help a bit.  (But I'll only be able to say a little in a youtube comment I'm afraid!  These concepts really are hard!)   First, the situation your friend was talking about was the Twin Paradox, which is related to what's going on here, but it isn't exactly the same.  In the Twin paradox, there are two observers, and one of them accelerates, and the observer who accelerates does experience time going more slowly than the observer who doesn't accelerate.  Your friend was right about that. But, that's not what's going on here.  Here, we have two observers, and neither of them accelerates.  So, it's a different scenario.  The short answer is this:  You can make the same argument for both parties (you're right!), and both parties think the other one is experiencing time more slowly.   If each person carries a clock, and both of them can see their own clock and the other person's clock, they will both claim that the other person's clock is running more slowly than their own. I'm sure that what I've written above won't be satisfactory.  (Just too much to say in too little space.)  If you'd like to learn special relativity, I'd really suggest paying attention to the \"relativity of simultaneity\", which is the term for the lightning example given in the video.

Einstein's usually considered the only author of the theory, but there are some honorable mentions of his predecessors, i.e. Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9; 4. SR does apply to accelerating frames; it's even stressed in the Wikipedia article. It doesn't apply the relativity principle to them, though, unlike GR; 5. SR does not explain why c is invariant; it simply postulates it, and it has a velocity transformation formula which is consistent with the initial postulate. If you distinguish c from the speed of light in vacuum (say, c_0), then SR alone doesn't explain this invariance either -- only in combination with the Maxwell's equations. 6. There are some missing spaces between numbers and units; SI recommends spaces.

Feel free to take a look if you want a more in-depth understanding of SR.   Here's the short version to hopefully clear things up for you.  If you stand still and measure the speed of a light pulse, you would get the speed of light \"c\".  Let's now say that another observer is moving in the direction of that light pulse , at a velocity v, and also measuring it's speed.  Intuitively, you would assume that they measure the speed of the pulse to be c-v relative to them.   The problem is that, in reality, they also measure the speed of light to be moving at c.  So how do you account for this?  Since v=d/t, you could accuse them of measuring either distance or time incorrectly.  In order for them to increase the velocity from c-v to c, they must have either measured a longer distance or a shorter time... or maybe both.   In my chapter 2 video, we find out that the answer is both, and that is the roots of length contraction and time dilation.  I hope this helped!

Journal of Science 1933 Prof. A Larmor MA states 'Einstein gives a chapter on the behaviour of rods and clocks in motion. He shows from the Lorentz equations that a rod when moving in the direction of its length is shorter than when at rest, and does not discuss the matter further. Lorentz says that the contraction of the rod is a real contraction. Eddington says that nothing whatever has happened to the rod, Its apparent contraction is due to a change in the relation of the rod to the observer. These conflicting views can be partially reconciled by a simple explanation on the basis of the existence of rays which appear to clear up the whole matter without invoking the world of four dimensions.' Journal of Science 1933 Sir Oliver Lodge FRS on The Lorentz contraction when observing the position of Jupiter to two observers states' But in what follows we endeavour to show that this curious time distortion, so repugnant to common sense, need not necessarily be considered to be a physical fact, though it remains a useful mathematical fiction.' Journal of Science 1923 C Bickerdike MA The Physical Interpretation of Relativity discusses rods in motion and clocks slowing states'In the whole book however there is no explanation of how such measuring and observing of the effects could conceivably be made.'   I could list more, so whilst it is good to challenge science experiments one should not bias towards just a theory when up against experimental evidence that can be repeated.  If the results challenge ones doctrines they should endeavour to be improved upon not dismissed as that would be un-scientific.

It's more about the length of the worldline between two events in spacetime. That length is the proper time of the worldline (ie the time experienced by someone on the worldline).  Because spacetime geometry is hyperbolic in nature, our intuitions about what the \"shortest\" path between two events in spacetime doesn't work. The shortest path will actually tend to look like the longer one in normal cartesian coordinates. The longest path between two events in spacetime (assuming they are time-like separated) is always a straight line. Any other path will be shorter. So, the twin that stays behind on Earth has a straight line path between the departure and return of his brother, so he experiences the most possible time between those two events. His brother, taking a shorter path through spacetime between those two events; a feat that requires accelerating somewhere along the journey; will be younger upon his return as a result.  If both brothers accelerate but in a non-equal way, then you have to look at their worldlines and do the math to determine the length of each to figure out which one is older upon their reuniting, or if they're the same age.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgzDqITww1wYJBm-PHh4AaABAg.8rJ1xEWTaPz8snLNLKpXrZ", "comment": "If you want to talk about actual perceptions in these kinds of scenarios, it gets even more weird.

I realize I am displaying what you call arrogance by criticizing the theories of others.  I hope you realize many other physicists admit relativity theory and quantum theory, and other professionally used theories, have problems.  I accept any theory for both its good and its bad, and in physics I have tried to make improvements.  I have spent over 30 years trying to improve on the fundamental assumptions of the professionally used theories, to invent a theory which has more good and less bad.  Resultantly, I happen to have invented what I am certain is a better theory.  If you have viewed my videos, and my replies to others\u2019 comments on them, you will understand why I am not publishing in any journal.  I think you need to rethink your position about being offended when someone criticizes a theory or promotes what they think is a better theory.  Would you be offended by, for example, Einstein, for criticizing the established professional theories of his time, and for promoting his relativity theory, which he invented to try to improve on them?  Criticism and promotion are a necessary part of science.  Who will know a problem exists if no 1 mentions it?  Who will know a solution exists if no 1 mentions it?  And instead of having an expert tell you which theory they think is better, you can decide for yourself.

As far as the Copenhagen interpretation of QM, the math of QM and the interpretation of what it means are separate concerns. The model does an excellent job of explaining observations and predicting outcomes. There really isn't much debate about the validity and usefulness of the model of QM. What physicists have done a terrible job at is developing an underlying understanding of what the model of QM means qualitatively about the nature of reality. The Copenhagen interpretation was the first major attempt at this and is no longer well-subscribed. Unfortunately, physicists who spend time thinking about that particular problem don't get much interest or respect.

If we compare these cars with together,we can say: second car has a less depreciation or say: passing of the time for second car was slower . As a result    less depreciation is like :passing of the time with slower speed According of this theory:The distance of  the Electrons passing around of the nucleon of the atom, is like a millage of the car. If we can reduce this distance ,millage reduces and we have less depreciation or passing of the time with less speed .( like atoms at Black Hole that the electron attaches to the nucleon and they are not moving at all,the time is not passing or there is no depreciation) As you know,with increasing the speed of the atoms ( very high speed, fracture of light speed) we can reduces the distance between electron levels of atoms and reduce depreciation or reduce  passing the time. As second example we consider 2 twins  brothers:One of them is going to the space with high speed,and second one stay at the earth. After for example 50 years ,the first brother comeback to the earth and we can compare these brothers with together: The first one looks younger.why? Because he had high speed for 50 years ,with this  speed, the distance between  electron levels in his body  reduced ( the electrons moved less or they have less millage) and they have less depreciation or the time passed for first brother with less speed. I think the time always passing with the same speed and if Einstein said: passing of the time is the function of speed, we can explain it like this: The high speed is a main reason for reducing the distance between electron level and the electron has a less millage ,less movement and less depreciation, that is equal with slower passing of the time Thanks Sepehr Pour zahed", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgwvcUO_DCZ60C_Xs7N4AaABAg", "comment": "When explaining these complicated concepts, speaking faster than the speed of light doesn\u2019t help....slow down Charlie...", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "Ugwlkx_IRNFfB6461BR4AaABAg", "comment": "Uhh...

Alice is carrying a long pole through a barn with doors on each end.  At rest, the pole is too long to fit into the barn with both doors closed.  Alice, understanding special relativity, makes a bet with her friends Bob and Charlie that, if she can run fast enough, she can fit the pole inside the barn with both doors closed.  She arranges to have Bob close the front doors as soon as the end of the pole passes into the barn, and Charlie to open the back doors just before the front of the pole reaches the end of the barn.                                                         A                              _____________                                            /                           \\            O                            /                             \\ ____/ |\\________         B (front door)      C (back door)            /\\                            _______________     So, with the front doors initially open and the back doors initially closed, Alice runs with her pole through the barn, and Bob and Charlie both handle their door opening/closing duties.  Is the pole ever completely inside the barn with both doors closed at the same time?   Let's first consider Bob and Charlie's perspective.  Since they occupy the same inertial reference frame (they are motionless relative to each other), I'll just say from Bob's perspective. So from Bob's perspective, the pole shrinks due to length contraction.  Assuming Alice runs fast enough, Bob will see the pole shrink so much that it becomes shorter than the barn.  So when he closes the front doors, the front of the pole will not yet have reached the back doors, hence Charlie will not yet have opened them.  Therefore, according to Bob, the pole fits inside the barn with both doors closed.  But now let's consider Alice's perspective.  According to Alice, the pole stays the same length it has always been. In fact, it is the barn that shrinks.  Clearly if the pole didn't fit into the barn at rest, it certainly won't fit into it now that the barn is shorter.  Therefore, the front of the pole will reach the back of the barn long before the back of the pole clears the front doors.  So Alice will say that Charlie opened the back doors before Bob closed the front doors, and the pole never fit inside the barn with both doors closed.    How can this be? Relativity tells us that both points of view are equally valid.  The problem is with simultaneity.  Because of time dilation, two observers in different inertial frames travelling at some non-zero relative velocity will disagree on when some event happens.  In our example here, Bob and Alice will disagree on when Charlie opens the back doors.  Bob will say that Charlie opened the doors after Bob closed the front doors, but Alice will say that Charlie opened the back doors before Bob closed the front doors.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgzS7Wjlo_GLotRwauV4AaABAg.8ZO0ZDAqKrG8ZU-xRE7CEi", "comment": "And yes the illustration was necessary :D", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgzS7Wjlo_GLotRwauV4AaABAg.8ZO0ZDAqKrG8ZZEx0p--Tz", "comment": "Thanks for the explanation!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgxqDfstFmb5yR0QVOx4AaABAg.8ZJXONL9C8H8ZTzVe7pseT", "comment": "Why a weight?

TIME-DILATION EQUATION  First, you can write the time-dilation equation several different ways, all of which are equivalent. Because people often get confused over who T is and who T naught is (or who T1 is and who T2 is), I like to use descriptive words. One way to write the equation is T for proper-time person = T for other person TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ). An equivalent way to write it is T for other person = T for proper-time person TIMES (1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ) ), which is the same as T for other person = T for proper-time person TIMES gamma, where gamma equals 1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ). It\u2019s much easier to express this in math symbols than words, but I can\u2019t do it in these comments.   Let\u2019s use the first equation: T for proper-time person = T for other person TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ).   Second, one must correctly identify who is the \u201cproper-time person\u201d and who is the \u201cother person.\u201d Proper time is the time duration (interval) between events in the reference frame where the events happen at the same place. The two events are the start of the time interval (Event 1), and the second event is the end of the time interval (Event 2). The person who measures proper time measures the two events at the same place, using a watch on his or her wrist. That\u2019s why many people call proper time \u201cwristwatch\u201d time.   Third, in example in the video, you are standing at the train station and Bob is on the train. As measured by you, Bob is measuring proper time because he measures the time duration (interval) between events in the reference frame where the events happen at the same place: the start of the time interval (Event 1) and the end of the time interval (Event 2). Bob uses the same clock (the watch on his wrist) to measure Events 1 and 2, and therefore Bob measures proper time. For Bob, both events happen at the same place; Bob measures both events by looking at the watch on his wrist. (From your reference frame, with you on the platform, the events happen at different places.)   From your frame of reference, the time-dilation equation is   T for proper-time person = T for other person TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ).  Substituting the names of the observers, we get the following:   T for Bob = T for you TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ).  You could also rearrange the terms to get the following:  T for you = T for Bob TIMES (1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ) ), which is the same as T for you = T for Bob TIMES gamma, where gamma equals 1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ).  LENGTH-CONTRACTION EQUATION  First, you can write the length-contraction dilation equation several different ways, all of which are equivalent. Because people often get confused over who is measuring L and L naught (or who L1 is and who L2 is), I like to use descriptive words. Let\u2019s use \u201cL rest\u201d for the person measuring the \u201crest length\u201d of the object and \u201cL contracted\u201d for the person measuring the contracted length of the object. (Note: Length contraction only occurs in the direction of motion.)  One way to write the length-contraction equation is L contracted = L rest TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ). An equivalent way to write it is L rest = L contracted TIMES (1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ) ), which is the same as L rest = L contracted TIMES gamma, where gamma equals 1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ). It\u2019s much easier to express this in math symbols than words, but I can\u2019t do it in these comments.   Let\u2019s use the first equation: L contracted = L rest TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] )  Second, one must correctly identify who is measuring rest length and who is measuring contracted length. Rest length is the length of an object in the reference frame where the object is at rest. Contracted length is the length of an object in the reference frame where the object is not at rest (i.e., it\u2019s moving). In the video, the observers are measuring the length of the train. The train is at rest in Bob\u2019s reference frame\u2014the train is not moving relative to Bob\u2014so he is measuring the rest-length of the train. In your reference frame (with you standing in the station), the train is moving, so you are measuring the contracted length of the train.   From your frame of reference, the length-contraction equation is   L contracted = L rest TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] )  Substituting the names of the observers, we get the following:   L as measured by you = L as measured by Bob TIMES the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] )  You could also rearrange the terms to get the following:  L as measured by Bob = L as measured by you TIMES (1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ) ), which is the same as L as measured by Bob = L as measured by you TIMES gamma, where gamma equals 1 DIVIDED BY the SQUARE ROOT of (1 MINUS [v squared / c squared] ).", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgwLxwqhlmfE9DEoZVB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you so much it helped me a lot", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgzinZTyGfrWax1_S7N4AaABAg", "comment": "lol basic", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgwsMSzdwSkfO6nBKc54AaABAg", "comment": "This is the worst video on special relativity I have seen.

From Alice's perspective, she has been sitting still the whole and it was Bob who was in motion, so she will be older when Bob arrives.  The problem is that one of the twins had to accelerate to reach the high relative velocity they travelled at and then decelerate in order to come back together again.  Special relativity is only valid in non-accelerating frames: if you introduce an accelerated (non-inertial) frame, it breaks down. In order to account for accelerating frames, you must use the general theory of relativity (GR).  GR tells us that gravity (which is equivalent to acceleration via Einstein's \"equivalence principle\") slows time as well (did you see the movie Interstellar? Remember the ocean planet near the black hole...). So because Alice spent time accelerating, both she and Bob agree that she will have aged less than Bob when she returns to earth.  tl;dr: that was a pretty long winded explanation and probably not even a very good one.

The wiever can get lost pretty fast as I did. The main problem is what t and t0 actually stands for. Time which Alice is wathing on her clocks or time she is watching on Bob's clocks or the oppopise.

One thing is really really hard and that thing is proper understanding of the concepts and consequeces of special relativity, when explained loosely as I could see I can lead to false wiev created in younger watchers, who have never seen any information about STR yet. Take for example the importance of measurment. What does \"lenght\" actually means? Or when the clocs are synchronous? These questions bafled me for almost all my study of STR and GTR when I finally worked out what doues it actually mean. It is all about the second postulate of STR, the postulate of constancy of speed of light. When the clocks are synchronous the last thing you can see if you look at them is they are synchronous. Because every clocksecond more far away clocks show one second less time that the clocks they are closer to the observer. It is complicated. For example how would ever the video explain the lenght constraction happens only in direction of travel? It goes on and on ... The second thing I understood from the theory of relativity is that is not at all about relativity as about absolustnes. From the first postulate I get, that the time is THE SAME for everyone, no matter if he or she is moving or not.

For instance, from Alice's frame of reference, Alice is stationary. From Charlie's point of view, Alice is travelling directly towards Bob.  Let's suppose that Charlie measures the velocities of both Alice and Bob and finds them each to be travelling towards each other at 51% of the speed of light. This is perfectly valid since neither is travelling at or faster than the speed of light.  Now let's move into Alice's point of view.  She is stationary while Bob is moving towards her.  In special relativity, when moving between frames, we do not simply add velocities in the same way we do in Newtonian kinematics as that would violate the rule that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.  It is not true that Bob is travelling towards Alice at 102% of the speed of light.  The requirement that nothing travel faster than light forces us to move between reference frames through what's called a \"Lorentz transformation\" rather than by the classical \"Galilean transformation\" that simply adds/subtracts the velocities.  These are just different formulas for changing coordinates from one reference frame to another so that the postulate that nothing travels faster than light speed is not violated.

Say there is another train stop 1 light year down the track from you. From Bob's point of view on the train, the distance to that next train stop is shorter than 1 light year. So from your point of view the length of the train is contracted, but from Bob's point of view the distance ahead of him is contracted. This is important because you and Bob have to agree on one other thing besides the speed of light: how many ticks of a clock separate two events. The example of Bob looking in the mirror is an instance of a light clock, so lets keep using that. You see time moving slower for Bob because the light has to travel a longer distance going back and forth. However, if you could watch his entire journey to the next train stop, you could count the number of back and forth \"ticks\" of the light clock going back and forth between Bob and the mirror. Lets say you count X ticks. Now for Bob that light is traveling a much shorter path back and forth. If the distance to the next train stop was 1 light year, he would expect to count Y ticks, where Y > X. But when you meet up at the train stop to compare notes, you must agree on how many ticks of the clock there were, Bob must also have seen X ticks. This means Bob could not have traveled 1 light year from his perspective. It has been awhile since I did a Special Relativity calculation but I think the formulas presented int the video are all you need. I am pretty sure from Bob's perspective the distance to the next train station is 0.866 light-years (his forward length contraction is proportional to how much you see time slowed for him, if you see his clocks running at 0.866 times the speed of yours, he only has to cover 0.866 times the distance you perceive to achieve the same number of ticks).  edit: Note that you might think this contradicts the relativity of simultaneity discussed in the video. It doesn't, because that principle is only about things that don't have a cause and effect relationship. The timing between the two lightning strikes can be disagreed about because neither could have caused the other, but the light clock setup with the mirror is a series of cause-and-effect relationships which you must agree on.

The observer at the station however, starts the stopwatch when the mirror is behind the station, and stops the stopwatch when the mirror is now closer to the station. This means the measurement of initial and final time occurred in different spatial coordinates for the station observer, therefore her time dilates and she measures a larger time.  Same for the length. The front and back of the train are always located in the same spatial coordinates relative to the train observer no matter how fast the train is moving,  so the train measures proper length. The station observer however will always measure the front and back of the train at different spatial coordinates because the train is constantly moving - each measurement of length will occur at different points in space.

All that I claim is that some two events can happen at the exact same time. Imagine 2 strobes only centimeters apart from each other. Both synchronized so that both strobes flash at the same time every 5 seconds. Now move one of those strobes over a distance of say 1 lightsecond away from the other strobe. Sure then from your relative frame of reference it seems like they are out of sync now by 1 second. This is your truth, you simply can't observe differently. But both strobes still flash at the same time. Thanks to the constant speed of light we are certain what the distance between the strobes is.  When presentism states that \"everything needs to exist simultaneously\" (in the present) then this doesn't require different events to exist simultaneously - this is a wrong interpretation. It does however require all the observable matter and energy that emanates from different events to exist simultaneously. But this doesn't mean that you can observe this matter and energy at the same time. Let's keep it simple and only talk about light here. My understanding of presentism is, that only the light already emitted, the light that has been on its way since then and the light currently reaching your eyeball exists. This light just propagates from one moment to the next and covers the smallest distance possible (could be 1 Planck length). So you could say that such a moment is an indivisible small amount of time (could be 1 Planck time). I like to think that this universe only changes from one moment to the next through some intrinsic form of momentum.

Yes, that second strobe seems delayed by 1 second but so long as you know how far it is from you, you can calculate the precise time from your frame of reference when the light was actually emitted. However, for someone in (significant) motion relative to the strobes, they will calculate that they actually flash at different times, even after correcting for the travel time of the light. Someone travelling the opposite direction will claim that their timing was different than the first moving frame, and will disagree on what order they flash. They all will also disagree on how far apart the strobes are. None of them is more right than the other ones. The only thing they won't disagree on is the spacetime interval between the strobe flashes, because that is invariant across all reference frames.  \"Now\" is a relative thing. Only frames of reference stationary relative to each other will agree perfectly about what \"now\" is across the universe.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgiAdJ5KBnDz8XgCoAEC.8PM5W8wnFfs8PNTC0V6sbg", "comment": "You are still arguing about something that I don't question and that I accept since I learned about STR.

It isn't any more pilosophical und any less scientifical as the concept of past and future. Both ideas require the same kind of predictions and verifiability and if someone can test them one would disprove the other I guess. But I think it would absolutely help us improve our model of reality. It could lead to a whole new understanding of space and time. Time is ultimately just a measure of change (I am not too specific about changes in what, but it probably happens at the quantum level) - without change time wouldn''t even make sense. But space on the other hand is a measure of position of things - and things always have position, indepedent of their nature to change. As far as we know the \"flow of time\" is due to causality and its reverse doesn't happen (not any evidence, Doc ;). Moving something back and forth however is very natural. Hence the dimensions of space and time seem to be on very different physical levels. That's why I don't like to think in terms of 4-dimensional spacetime.  Just as an update here and for comparison: It seems that I have developed a view about time that is very similar to the view of Leibniz, but not contrary to the view of Einstein.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgiAdJ5KBnDz8XgCoAEC.8PM5W8wnFfs8PNfo46hUTB", "comment": "It is purely a philosophical view. That's why it's formally called philosophical presentism. As an idea, it makes no testable predictions. It doesn't provide a model that helps us to predict the outcome of any kind of events in the real world. It's more of a metaphysical framework. It doesn't really help you answer any question of the form \"What would happen if X?\" the way the theories of relativity can. Until you can formulate a testable, risky prediction based on the idea (a risky prediction is one such that a\u00a0vast majority\u00a0of the range of conceivable outcomes of a test of the prediction would falsify it), its only value as an idea is in philosophy.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AInCqm5nCzw", "cid": "UgiAdJ5KBnDz8XgCoAEC.8PM5W8wnFfs8PNgG7Xzxqa", "comment": "Okay, seems like you don't like to think outside the box.
