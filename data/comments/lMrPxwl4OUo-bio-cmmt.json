Are you saying that you and I, as human beings, have all the exact same DNA, and that any differences in our features are due to what genetic information we each have turned on and off?  As to your last question of a step by step process to explain the complex features of life, I fully admit that there are gaps in the evolutionary timeline and that we can't account for all diversity, but that doesn't mean evolution is false. In the same way we can say the atomic theory is limited, in that it doesn't explain exactly what ll the components of an atom are made of, or exactly how they behave, or even where a given electron can be at any given time. This is true of all scientific theories.  A quick science lesson about how theories form. First, an observation is made in the natural world, which leads to the formation of questions and light research to form a hypothesis (a guess about why nature behaves in the way it does). This guess is then tested, which means a scientist try's to disprove it, not prove it. If it cannot be disproved, more research is done with regards to that hypothesis. the longer this goes on the more robust the research supporting a claim becomes (not proving it, but supporting it). Eventually some ideas gain so much credibility that they become theories. This doesn't mean that they are not wrong, but that everything we have observed so far supports them. Sometimes research will come along that pulls into question this claim or that claim about a particular theory, and so that claim may be adjusted to fit the new research, but the entire theory is not thrown out altogether unless new research comes along that can explain everything the old theory did better and more accurately.

Are we gaining species, or losing species?", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "lMrPxwl4OUo", "cid": "UgxuCRLsUZJHVRv8JFF4AaABAg.8W7iRCkcz358XHEsX6B8kc", "comment": "You want to hear a good presupposition? Assuming information wasn't cherry picked because, a \"guy wrote a book on the subject!\" :D There are plenty of books explaining a flat earth, doesn't make them true.  I wouldn't say that we have more or less DNA, just that it is much different. (admittedly I haven't studied this topic much). I'm sure there have been fluctuations in the genetic diversity of life, but I don't believe there is a downward or upward trend.  We have also certainly gained species, the fossil record is one mass evidence of this. I recall that some 99% of the earth's species are extinct, not because we had more and now have less, but because many have come and gone throughout time as evolution took place.   Concerning the six presuppositions, they are hardly glaring exposures.   Let me explain the best I can. Mind you, I'm no scholar, I only have a Bachelors on Biology and simply enjoy the subject.   1 - I would argue the first presupposition is simply that \"life came to be.\" The metaphysical realm cannot be tested by science, such as whether god exists or not, if the planet feels pain, if telepaths speak with the dead. These are, as of now, outside the physical realm and can't be studied by the current tools of science. But most certainly life came to be, and why not use any physical test or evidence to determine how.   2 - Again, life on this earth came from somewhere, and scientists can't test the metaphysical. God putting life on this earth vs life spontaneously starting does not discount evolution. Life had to start (or be put) on this planet somehow.  3 - This is not a presupposition. The fossil record shows obvious progression from simple life forms to more complex. I don't know the extent of fossils we have discovered, but  I know there are far, far more than most people assume. I also know that there are holes and gaps in that fossil record, but that doesn't discount the claim that life started simple and all other life evolved from it. We would need to find a dinosaur fossil in  a layer of simple multi-cellular organisms long before any other dinosaur fossil is observed. This has never happened.   4 - The author starts using a lot of \"they\" here. I'm not sure who he is referring to, but if it is scientists, he is  taking their words far out of context. The fossil record supports the claim that simple organisms evolved into more complex ones, and that many species died off along the way. Also, he states most of the claims in this paragraph incorrectly. For example, saying that there are chance mutations, the change is positive, and it gives an advantage is not how it works. Rather, there is variability in all species, species (generally) produce more offspring then the environment can support, nature \"selects\" who survives, the survivors genes are passed on. And yes, there are chance genetic mutations that can have a \"positive\" impact and possibly make an individual more fit for it's environment.   5 - The fifth \"element\" is similar to the forth, it is awkwardly stated, but in this section he is nearly correct in his explanation. I'm also not sure how this one is a presupposition, perhaps you can explain. To put it simply, Darwin observed organisms fitting there environments very well, and in the case of the finches, filling unique niches. He came up with natural selection to explain this and I agree that there may have been some presupposition on his part. However, scientists have observed natural selection in real time and no verifiable better explanation has come forward. You can reference the link in the post with the quote above if you want to see some of that research.   6 - The sixth one could be stated for nearly any theory. Gravity, the atom, the cell are all purely natural. This is because scientists don't ask why, at least, not from a research perspective, because they can't. Instead they ask how. And while those may sound the same to you, they are not. \"How\" asks by what method something happens, \"why\" asks for what reason something happens. Think of how you bake a cake vs why you bake a cake. So it's not that scientists don't tolerate design because it implies intelligence, they don't even consider why something happens, again, not from a research perspective. Scientists can and do question why things in nature occur the way they do and some fully support a creator, even some evolutionists.   His last three paragraphs are where he really shows his ignorance. Accepting microevoltuion and rejecting macroevolution is moronic. The only difference between the two is that microevolution looks at what happens within a single species, and macroevolution looks at what happens between two or more species. But the both operate by the exact same mechanisms. The same processes that cause variation within a species can cause variation between species, that is, the formation of a new species. If you put some time into studying genetics with it's relation to evolution this becomes very clear.   The last paragraph is a bunch of \"so what\" in regards to evolution and mostly the author stating his agenda. If people want to believe in God, great, if they don't, fine. If atheists want to use evolution to support there atheism, that's their choice (though I don't think it wise) and it has no effect on whether or not the theory of evolution is correct.

When the welfare of one individual depends upon the other a sense of justice and reciprocity develops.    Furthermore, the creation of gods is a byproduct of another survival adaptation.  And that adaptation, or instinct, is to ascribe agency or intent to natural phenomena. If our hunter gatherer ancestors heard a rustling in the tall grass assuming that it was a lion out to kill them (rather than merely the wind) gave them a better chance of surviving even if they were wrong.  As behavior has a genetic component that can be passed along this behavior became common and instinct in humans. We see this played out in the fact that early human cultures have gods for everything that they feared... volcano god, tsunami god, earthquake god, etc.  Making these gods happy was a way to avoid disaster.

As to your last question of a step by step process to explain the complex features of life, I fully admit that there are gaps in the evolutionary timeline and that we can't account for all diversity, but that doesn't mean evolution is false. In the same way we can say the atomic theory is limited, in that it doesn't explain exactly what ll the components of an atom are made of, or exactly how they behave, or even where a given electron can be at any given time. This is true of all scientific theories.  A quick science lesson about how theories form. First, an observation is made in the natural world, which leads to the formation of questions and light research to form a hypothesis (a guess about why nature behaves in the way it does). This guess is then tested, which means a scientist try's to disprove it, not prove it. If it cannot be disproved, more research is done with regards to that hypothesis. the longer this goes on the more robust the research supporting a claim becomes (not proving it, but supporting it). Eventually some ideas gain so much credibility that they become theories. This doesn't mean that they are not wrong, but that everything we have observed so far supports them. Sometimes research will come along that pulls into question this claim or that claim about a particular theory, and so that claim may be adjusted to fit the new research, but the entire theory is not thrown out altogether unless new research comes along that can explain everything the old theory did better and more accurately.

Assuming information wasn't cherry picked because, a \"guy wrote a book on the subject!\" :D There are plenty of books explaining a flat earth, doesn't make them true.  I wouldn't say that we have more or less DNA, just that it is much different. (admittedly I haven't studied this topic much). I'm sure there have been fluctuations in the genetic diversity of life, but I don't believe there is a downward or upward trend.  We have also certainly gained species, the fossil record is one mass evidence of this. I recall that some 99% of the earth's species are extinct, not because we had more and now have less, but because many have come and gone throughout time as evolution took place.   Concerning the six presuppositions, they are hardly glaring exposures.   Let me explain the best I can. Mind you, I'm no scholar, I only have a Bachelors on Biology and simply enjoy the subject.   1 - I would argue the first presupposition is simply that \"life came to be.\" The metaphysical realm cannot be tested by science, such as whether god exists or not, if the planet feels pain, if telepaths speak with the dead. These are, as of now, outside the physical realm and can't be studied by the current tools of science. But most certainly life came to be, and why not use any physical test or evidence to determine how.   2 - Again, life on this earth came from somewhere, and scientists can't test the metaphysical. God putting life on this earth vs life spontaneously starting does not discount evolution. Life had to start (or be put) on this planet somehow.  3 - This is not a presupposition. The fossil record shows obvious progression from simple life forms to more complex. I don't know the extent of fossils we have discovered, but  I know there are far, far more than most people assume. I also know that there are holes and gaps in that fossil record, but that doesn't discount the claim that life started simple and all other life evolved from it. We would need to find a dinosaur fossil in  a layer of simple multi-cellular organisms long before any other dinosaur fossil is observed. This has never happened.   4 - The author starts using a lot of \"they\" here. I'm not sure who he is referring to, but if it is scientists, he is  taking their words far out of context. The fossil record supports the claim that simple organisms evolved into more complex ones, and that many species died off along the way. Also, he states most of the claims in this paragraph incorrectly. For example, saying that there are chance mutations, the change is positive, and it gives an advantage is not how it works. Rather, there is variability in all species, species (generally) produce more offspring then the environment can support, nature \"selects\" who survives, the survivors genes are passed on. And yes, there are chance genetic mutations that can have a \"positive\" impact and possibly make an individual more fit for it's environment.   5 - The fifth \"element\" is similar to the forth, it is awkwardly stated, but in this section he is nearly correct in his explanation. I'm also not sure how this one is a presupposition, perhaps you can explain. To put it simply, Darwin observed organisms fitting there environments very well, and in the case of the finches, filling unique niches. He came up with natural selection to explain this and I agree that there may have been some presupposition on his part. However, scientists have observed natural selection in real time and no verifiable better explanation has come forward. You can reference the link in the post with the quote above if you want to see some of that research.   6 - The sixth one could be stated for nearly any theory. Gravity, the atom, the cell are all purely natural. This is because scientists don't ask why, at least, not from a research perspective, because they can't. Instead they ask how. And while those may sound the same to you, they are not. \"How\" asks by what method something happens, \"why\" asks for what reason something happens. Think of how you bake a cake vs why you bake a cake. So it's not that scientists don't tolerate design because it implies intelligence, they don't even consider why something happens, again, not from a research perspective. Scientists can and do question why things in nature occur the way they do and some fully support a creator, even some evolutionists.   His last three paragraphs are where he really shows his ignorance. Accepting microevoltuion and rejecting macroevolution is moronic. The only difference between the two is that microevolution looks at what happens within a single species, and macroevolution looks at what happens between two or more species. But the both operate by the exact same mechanisms. The same processes that cause variation within a species can cause variation between species, that is, the formation of a new species. If you put some time into studying genetics with it's relation to evolution this becomes very clear.   The last paragraph is a bunch of \"so what\" in regards to evolution and mostly the author stating his agenda. If people want to believe in God, great, if they don't, fine. If atheists want to use evolution to support there atheism, that's their choice (though I don't think it wise) and it has no effect on whether or not the theory of evolution is correct.

Religions merely usurped morality.  Morality, or right and wrong behavior, is a survival adaptation seen in animals that live in social groups.  When the welfare of one individual depends upon the other a sense of justice and reciprocity develops.    Furthermore, the creation of gods is a byproduct of another survival adaptation.  And that adaptation, or instinct, is to ascribe agency or intent to natural phenomena. If our hunter gatherer ancestors heard a rustling in the tall grass assuming that it was a lion out to kill them (rather than merely the wind) gave them a better chance of surviving even if they were wrong.  As behavior has a genetic component that can be passed along this behavior became common and instinct in humans. We see this played out in the fact that early human cultures have gods for everything that they feared... volcano god, tsunami god, earthquake god, etc.  Making these gods happy was a way to avoid disaster.

As with all else, you assert it is a creation in order to necessitate your creator. We actually have many independent studies that give us an idea of how RNA (for example) can take the shape and function of enzymes, how it can make more RNA, how it can swap pieces with other RNA, and how it can increase the length of yet other RNA strands.
