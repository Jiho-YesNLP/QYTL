And why does the mitochandrial DNA not change with time? We observe mutations in the DNA of rhe nucelous all the time - this is what makes us different - so why doesn't the mitochondrial DNA change? Also I wonder if there is something like Mitochondrial-cancer, you know cancer cells divide and divide and grow. Couldn't a mitochondria do the same? So back to the plants, what brought me to that questions the first time. If chloroplasts are like mitochondria, swallowed up bacteria, and if we can use the mitochondrial DNA in Mitochondria to find Eve for humans, can't we than use the DNA in chloroplast to find plant-Eve. And also if plants also have Mitochondria and and also their cells are eucaryotic couldn't it be that there was one cell in the beginning that did catch a mitochondria and kept it and then divided, and one of those then did catch the cytoplast? What I'm getting to is couldn't we use the DNA in those litte organells to find the common ancestor (cell) of plants and animals?
