Thus they experience equal friction forces. If the block should move at all we have to demand that the ramp is steep enough for the resulting tangential force to be larger than the friction force. The friction force and part of the tangential force (equal in magnitude with the friction) form a couple of forces which is the maximum torque to accelerate the ring's rotation.

A box can slide (kinetic friction) or stand (static friction). A ring can slide, stand or roll (rolling resistance).

If the force on an object is lesser than static friction, the object is motionless. If the force on an object is higher/equal than static friction, the object is moving with kinetic friction.  To support rolling the surface must have rolling resistance. Rolling resistance is less than kinetic friction.  In our case motion friction is zero and the force is higher than static friction - because the box moves. That leaves for the ring options to slide or roll, but it can't roll - rolling resistance is zero.  Much like the ring will not start rolling on the flat frictionless surface under lateral force (say, magnet, or wind), it will not start rolling down the ramp. If the force is strong enough to overcome static resistance, there is no reason for the bottom point of the ring (the contact point) stay still - the magnet affects it as much as it affects any other point of the ring.

Excellent, madame. Now, I would like to point out, that in conditions of the experiment we are clearly observing the box sliding, which leads to conclusion that net force indeed exceeds the force of static friction. Thus, slipping, and, considering zero kinetic friction, in addition to slipping we have no rolling. Period.

This is not sci-fi, this intended to be an educational-sorta video. This negligence to the very physical principals you are trying to demonstrate is unacceptable.  Why such disparage to my \"shouting on top of my lungs that reasoning is wrong\"? Reasoning is the core of natural sciences.

Or really, I guess I just want to try to salvage the video to make sense of it. Anyways, at 00:15, she says that you \"let go\" blah blah whatever...I actually had to go back to find a quote like this, because what I'm about to say is how I initially made sense of the video in my own mind, and her \"let go\" statement might be an assumption she/her team also made, just without explaining to the viewer. Now, I'm not a physics major/professional, at best I've taken some undergraduate-level courses, so I would love a civil, respectful case against what I'm about to say if I am wrong about anything, and would also appreciate any feedback if I happen to be right on anything else.  So, say it takes, I don't know, 0.100 seconds to have let go of these items, and let's call that time T1, with T0 = 0.000 seconds being when the hands are holding these items in place, say from the side of the object most-downward along the ramp. At T0, the normal force on the objects by the hands is equal and opposite to grav. force, thus net force (with respect to normal + grav.) is zero and the objects aren't going anywhere (yes I'm simplifying this, I know gravity acts downwards and that the ramp/normal force is at an angle). Between time T0 and T1, the hands are pulling away from the objects perfectly in the direction of intended motion, which is actively reducing that normal force, thus shifting the net force (net between normal + grav.) from zero to some magnitude greater than zero. Of course, there are still forces due to friction, and so as long as the sum of normal and grav. is less than the frictional force needed to move, there is no motion.  However, in the case of the ring/marble, this \"growing\" net (w.r.t normal+grav.) force only needs to exceed rolling resistance to start rolling, and as mentioned by some people, rolling friction is less than static friction, and so these two items should start rolling before enough \"growing net force\" exceeds static friction to allow for slippage. Now, in the case of the block, this \"growing net force\" between time T0/T1 actually does need to exceed static friction, since rolling isn't going to occur and the only way it will move will be due by sliding, and so gravity will eventually overpower static friction because the hand being pulled away will at some point be providing a low enough normal force that static friction isn't enough to hold the block in place.  Under this argument, the rolling objects would roll first without slipping, and the block object would slide. From that point, any arguments made about which one \"wins the race\" or whatever probably correctly apply as stated in the video. I think the distinction between what I am saying and what some people have posted above me in this thread, is mainly that some other people assume the items are moving due to a single given initial force (gravity) being applied for all items. If that were the case, then the force required to overcome static friction and get the block moving would most certainly cause slippage on the round objects. However, my argument takes into account the small fraction of a time when the hand is being pulled away, which actively reduces normal force and slowly builds up the force working against friction. It isn't a single given initial force applied to these objects, it's a progressive reduction of normal force that allows for rolling.  Now, I could be wrong. Please correct me if I'm wrong. In reality, there is a lot more that could be said; fortunately, this is supposed to be an idealized case. But I would love to hear what anyone would have to say, if anyone is still around to even respond to this.  As a side note (feel free to ignore this paragraph, it adds nothing to my case, it's just a side note), technically T1 for the block would be a bit later than the T1's for the ring/marble (at least on the scale of milliseconds), because if it requires more of a tug on it to get moving (since static friction is larger than rolling friction), then the hand needs to be \"pulled away\" a bit more for normal force to be reduced enough. So the part of the video that seems wrong to me is the implication that all 3 items can be let go at the same time and correspond with all 3 items starting to move at the same time. I think either they would all begin to move at a different time if let go simultaneously, or they would have to be let go at different times to start moving at the same time, though to be fair, this time difference is most likely pretty damn negligible.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "Ugh5-IWT2ByoRXgCoAEC.8FD4_c6zLC58_m8oYNn_4a", "comment": "Absolutely right.

(I need to get a life.)  The very very short answer is yes, that's a constant for balls (not spheres; spheres are hollow) of uniform density.  The almost-as-short answer is that most (in fact, nearly all) of the mass is closer to the axis of rotation than r, so that mass counts for less.  That doesn't get you to 2/5, though.  For the real answer, think of the ball as a series of rings.  From here on out, we'll pretend the entire radius is 1 because units are arbitrary and it makes the math easier; since units are essentially arbitrary we can do this.  Now that we're not using that letter anymore, we'll call the radius of each ring r.  Now, let's say we've chopped up the ball thinly enough that the thickness of each ring is negligible, so we can treat it as a cylinder.  (The ring in the video's example got this treatment.)  The mass of that ring will be proportional to the surface area of that cylinder, which is 2*pi*r*h, where h is the height of the cylinder.  By the properties of the ball, h = 2*sqrt(1-r^2) (think of the edge of the cylinder as a chord on a circular cross-section, and you can see how this follows from the Pythagorean theorem).  So the surface area of the cylinder is 4*pi*r*sqrt(1-r^2).  We'll pretend for now that the constant of proportionality is 1 (again, units are essentially arbitrary, so we can do this), so we can say that that is the mass per unit thickness of the \"ring.\"  (Note that this makes the mass of the whole marble 4*pi/3.)   So now for each infinitesimal cylinder we have that the moment of inertia per unit thickness is 4*pi*r^3*sqrt(1-r^2).  Here it gets a bit tricky - the trick is something called integration by parts, which is the converse of something called the product rule.  The product rule means, essentially, if you have a rectangle, and you know how quickly the sides are changing, you can treat the change of the whole rectangle as the sum of the change in each side by the current length of the other.  (That is, two infinitesimal rectangles - since the corner square is infinitesimal by infinitesimal, it vanishes in comparison.)  That is, you can express the derivative of a product as the sum of the former by the derivative of the latter and the latter by the derivative of the former.  By the same token, when you have an antiderivative of something that can be expressed as the product of an antiderivative and a derivative, you can treat it as one of the two summands in the product rule, and express the antiderivative as a difference.  In this case (pulling out the constant 4*pi), the derivative is r*sqrt(1-r^2), which is the derivative of (1-r^2)^(3/2)/3, and the antiderivative is r^2, which is the antiderivative of 2*r.  So the antiderivative of the whole thing is -4*pi*r^2*(1-r^2)^(3/2)/3 minus the antiderivative of -8*pi*r*(1-r^2)^(3/2)/3; the latter is 8*pi*(1-r^2)^(5/2)/15, so the whole antiderivative is equal to -4*pi*r^2*(1-r^2)^(3/2)/3 - 8*pi*(1-r^2)^(5/2)/15.  I know that looks intimidating, but it looks a lot less so when you realize you only have to consider the difference between the values at r = 1 and r = 0; at r = 1, (1-r^2) is zero, so both terms are zero, and at r = 0, the first term is zero, and the second is equal to -8*pi/15.  The moment of inertia, in the units where the radius is 1 and the mass is 4*pi/3, is (0 - (-8*pi/15)) = 8*pi/15, which is, in our units, 2/5 the mass.  (If you're put off by the lack of units, just pretend we've been working in cm and grams - or meters and Imperial tons, or whatever else - it genuinely doesn't matter.)  (EDIT: I just realized I didn't explain why the derivative of (1-r^2)^(3/2) would be -3*r*sqrt(1-r^2).  It's called the \"chain rule\" - what it is is that if you know how much a quantity is changing in relation to another quantity, and how much that quantity is changing in relation to a third quantity, by multiplying the two rates of change you'll get how much the first quantity is changing in relation to the third.  In this case, as she went over in the video on derivatives, the derivative x^(3/2) with respect to x is 3*sqrt(x)/2, and the derivative of (1-t^2) with respect to t would be -2t, so you just multiply the two.)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "UgjTSdHU8SLEeXgCoAEC.8FCzt41KiBA8FE-0VTiByu", "comment": "You're right, but there is friction on the ramp!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "UgiaiIZWVgCJFHgCoAEC.8FCuDJmu_-X8FHFfb_PMqW", "comment": "I actually wonder if that would've been distracting; was your grammar teacher attractive to you? :)", "votes": "21", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "UgiaiIZWVgCJFHgCoAEC.8FCuDJmu_-X8JRisJfGAc1", "comment": "savage af", "votes": "7", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "UgiaiIZWVgCJFHgCoAEC.8FCuDJmu_-X8c8UtpsGu6w", "comment": "Damn physics teachers always want it harder XD", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "UghA1Mg01pXRNngCoAEC.8FCrUAUvs9i8FCyrsB4f2n", "comment": "But they won't slide unless their lateral velocity and their angular velocity get out of sync.

The reason why the objects move down the ramp is the force the gravity. The force of gravity is always straight down to the Earth's center, so the component of gravity aligned going down the ramp is what moves the object down. Friction (static or kinetic) would oppose the force of gravity. The object moves when the force of gravity aligned with the ramp is greater than friction.   Reasons why she is considering static friction but not kinetic friction:  If there is static friction, an object that rotates about an axis, such as a sphere, will not slip. Static friction gives a force of gravity. The force gravity will cause translational motion, while that initial static friction will cause rotational motion. For objects that do not have rotational motion, such as the cube, will have no affect from that initial static friction other than breaking through the threshold of friction. If there is not kinetic friction, then we won't lose energy when moving down the ramp. If there was kinetic energy, the cube will move down the ramp much slower than the ring or the sphere because more of its surface is in contact with the ramp to be affected by friction. Kinetic friction causes energy lost, so rotational energy and kinetic energy will not equal potential energy as the video shows. Also if there was kinetic friction, the results of the race would be different. The sphere is only in contact with the surface at one point, so it would have the least lost of energy from kinetic friction and will get to the bottom first.

In the case of the box, the tangential friction force required to prevent the box from slipping is very easy to calculate: no slip means no movement, so F = ma = 0, and the gravity and friction forces must balance (in the tangential direction).  However, in the case of the ring, even if there is sufficient static friction to prevent slipping, the ring will still roll. This means that there is an acceleration in the tangential direction, which means that forces aren't balanced in the tangential direction. Since gravity is the same that it's always been, we must conclude that the friction force is smaller than the box case.

If the outcomes - the forces must be such and such and acceleration will be such - at least look plausible, then hypothesis, while still not proven, can be explored further.  If after postulating a hypothesis you face a break down of your system, a paradox of sorts, then your hypothesis is wrong or at the very least incompatible with the rest of presuppositions.  Now, back to your drawing, what is the sum of forces acting on the ring? The only force is gravity, in two orthogonal components. They form a right triangle, so values must follow the rule for the right triangle sides (a^2 + b^2 = c^2):  (m*g) ^2 = Ft ^2 + Fn ^2 = 1/4 * (m*g)^2 * (sin t)^2 + (m*g)^2 * (cos t)^2  Dividing both sides by (m*g)^2 we have 1 = 1/4 (sin t)^2 + (cos t)^2  Which is in contradiction with trig idendity (cos a)^2 + (sin a)^2 = 1  Thus, we conclude that proposed hypothesis would lead to impossible situation and should be rejected.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "b-HZ1SZPaQw", "cid": "Ughh8yYcSNRBD3gCoAEC.8FCQyKVHV_k8FXcnOdzakd", "comment": "***** In my diagram, Ft is the friction force, not the tangential component of gravity. In both cases the tangential component of gravity is indeed mg sin t (it's even written inside the box on the left, albeit as \"sin t mg\", which isn't the best way to write it :-) ). So in both cases, the trig identity is just fine. Sorry I didn't explicitly draw the tangential component of gravity on the diagram, I thought it was implied. But it's there in the sum of forces inside the box.  Tangential component of gravity: mg sin t Fricion force: 1/2 mg sin t  If the friction force were mg sin t in the ring case, that would leave the forces on the ring balanced, and hence no acceleration of the centre of mass of the ring would be possible. Thus. the ring would either stay glued in place or spin in-place like sonic the hedgehog. Both these claims are clearly absurd (and more scientifically, the former fails to balance torques, and the latter has friction force pointing the wrong way w.r.t. the direction of motion).
