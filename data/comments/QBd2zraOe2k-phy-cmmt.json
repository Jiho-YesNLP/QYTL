You said heat is absorbed here and every time gas expands the engine does work hence Work is positive. But in your Internal Energy you said system does work so work is  negative. and work is done on system, work is positive. I am finding these two contradicting and I am confused. This is what I think when you talking about work in the Cornot engine, Please correct me if I am correct on these two concepts.\u00a0 W= -PdeltaV. This formula is relative to the Work of the system not the surrounding right?   In the Carnot engine, when you mentioned Work is positive  when gas expands, you are talking about the work of the surrounding system not the work that the engine gains from the surrounding system right? and when the gas compress you said work is negative, you mean the work of the surrounding is negative?   Please help me clarify.

This is what you will need to know, if you desire a certain engine performance, and need to solve this in reverse to determine the geometry of the engine.  You ultimately add safety factors to this calculation to account for your ignorance of how non-ideal it is.

So helpful! I'm a little confused about the ideal gas problem - So in my ChemE thermo class we talk about the entropy change of an ideal gas as delta S  = integral of Cp*dT/T - ln(P/P0)*R. Now this would equal zero for a reversible process, but nowhere in the problem does this say that it is reversible and the only ispentropic processes are reversible and adiabatic. I'm not sure what to think because your reasoning makes sense here but I'm sure if you have an irreversible adiabatic process there's an entropy change, as all irreversible processes have entropy changes.
