Encapsulated switches were installed in removable rod ends screwed into actuator rams.  When the ram was fully retracted, a mechanical lock would drop into place to prevent uncommanded actuator extension.  The lock included a magnet that would open the reed switch.  A failure to lock would complete a circuit to an indicator module in the cockpit and signal that the actuator was not locked.  Although reasonably reliable, most reed switches have now been replaced by more sophisticated proximity sensors.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pw9_xmbFi6E", "cid": "UgwyrG-lQ0pAns2OTq94AaABAg", "comment": "i want to thank you for helping me and my friend in this semester we got an A in electrical engineering AC circuit, DC circuit and the number system because of your videos  <3", "votes": "9", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pw9_xmbFi6E", "cid": "UgwpXDUqovw30x0itzR4AaABAg", "comment": "The hero came back after  a week.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pw9_xmbFi6E", "cid": "Ugwgdd2sJmjh1aF64CR4AaABAg", "comment": "Nicer\ud83e\udd17", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pw9_xmbFi6E", "cid": "Ugw4HFkxgMD8QA6AeOR4AaABAg", "comment": "Brilliant", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "pw9_xmbFi6E", "cid": "UgzR1XYn6_9aZvQYUdx4AaABAg", "comment": "When you said \"a short circuit\", did you mean an open circuit?
