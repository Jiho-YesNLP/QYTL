Note that when it comes to a convergent lens, the focal lenght we consider is measured to the right and when it comes to a divergent lens, the focal lenght we consider is measured to the left.  There is a fancier way of putting it by dragging in primary and secondary focus of a lens as a supplimentary concept, but the above description is a simple way of putting it imo.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "7ehfXmO42h8", "cid": "UgzXW9elaoYpIs_KkUR4AaABAg.A0Q3y6RxmC1A7biEguQlpw", "comment": "Thx for the help.
