You'll notice that people are talking about the second law the thermodynamics and entropy. Both these things are the exact mathematical definition of what  Rhaegar19  is describing. Energy flows from where it is higher, towards where it is lower because it is the most probable configuration. This becomes clear when you work out the statistical behavior of a large number of atoms. To get an every day statistical example to help wrap your head around it consider two dice. The sum of two dice being rolled has different probabilities 2 and 12 have the lowest while 7 has the highest.  If you've ever played Settlers of Catan you'll have seen this first hand, or you could look at this image to see why 7 is the most probable https://bestcase.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dicediagram.jpg. When you look at this image you'll see 7 is the most probable because there is more ways to make 7 then any other number. Now if you were to roll 2 dice a million times you would find that 7 was rolled far more often then say 12. Heat flowing from hot to cold can be thought of as a million dice rolls. There are say a million atoms. Sometimes a atom does transfer energy from cold to hot, that's a roll of 12. However most atoms will transfer energy from hot to cold, that is a roll of 7.  This is why heat flow from hot to cold, there are more ways for this to happen then the other way around when you look at it on the atomic level.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "tuSC0ObB-qY", "cid": "UggfcYfzEQMk7ngCoAEC", "comment": "I am naked almost 24 hours a day.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "tuSC0ObB-qY", "cid": "UgjD0c8fH62CH3gCoAEC", "comment": "Having watched this enthralling crash course episode I've been able to calculate that if the temperature of the crash course studio were 2-3C warmer it would completely negate the need for clothing altogether!
