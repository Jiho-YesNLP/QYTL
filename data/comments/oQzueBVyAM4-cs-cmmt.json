This is because the data link layer operates at the link or segment level, ensuring the integrity of data transmission over individual links in the network.  Error control in transport layer:-  When there is an error from the first intermediate node to multiple nodes and to a destination node, the transport layer comes into play. The transport layer (e.g., TCP) manages error control for end-to-end communication between application processes running on different devices. It ensures the reliable delivery of data packets from the sender's application process to the receiver's application process, regardless of the number of intermediary nodes involved in the network path.So, the data link layer handles errors specific to individual links or segments of the network, while the transport layer ensures the reliability of end-to-end communication between application processes across the entire network path.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "UgzFhSW_1sRqJ4johep4AaABAg", "comment": "can i get the slide please?", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "UgwmJBJOhbbNYIpdjzx4AaABAg", "comment": "What does semantics mean", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "Ugwn95-VGntOyM-Xr_R4AaABAg", "comment": "Tq sm nesso \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764 I ll recommend my frnds and fam also \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\u2764\u2764\ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "UgxDgua-fNUTQIUdp9h4AaABAg", "comment": "What is the difference between the service of session layer Synchronization and the service transport layer end to end flow control?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "Ugx5swEkuexGCTzFdNl4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank  you so much\u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "UgyDJQaK61SG_AdHLot4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you sir!\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "oQzueBVyAM4", "cid": "Ugx4tYpzZ9OarzilGt54AaABAg", "comment": "You are a genius.
