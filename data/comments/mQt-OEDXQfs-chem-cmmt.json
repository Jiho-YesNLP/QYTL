So next time your teacher fails you for calling an ionic compound a molecule, you should tell them to study a bit of physics. Remember the entire theory of bonding stems from understanding physics and the laws that govern the microscopic world. There is really no distinction between \"polar covalent, non-polar covalent and ionic bonds\" in the sense that they are all a result of electric forces. The only difference is in the distribution of electron density around the atoms. But ultimately its the same type of electric bond. \u00a0 ;-)", "votes": "16", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "mQt-OEDXQfs", "cid": "Ugi1xQsgTdkouXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-UpyR8HDz6t6CaqM", "comment": ".... :D", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "mQt-OEDXQfs", "cid": "Ugi1xQsgTdkouXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-UpyR9dzuTQ1VpZX", "comment": "\u00a0@AKLECTURES\u00a0 are you still online?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "mQt-OEDXQfs", "cid": "Ugibk2_3nB21OngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-GJKO7-Hndc7N4iF", "comment": "you're welcome!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
