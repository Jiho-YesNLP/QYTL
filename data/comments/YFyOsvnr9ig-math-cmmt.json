What you should be doing in this case is this: borrow 10 TENS (100) from |5|00 which makes it into 4|10TENS|0 effectively read as 410.   Now when starting the calculation you need to borrow the 10 for the first 0 on the right, you do this 4|9TENS|10UNITS then subtract 10 - 4 = 6 which leaves us with 4|9TENS|6 or 496  then we go onto the next part, which is 9tens - 3tens = 6tens, which leaves us with 466 (you do not need to borrow a 10, this is the part where people mess up the most, they forget that this part of the number signifies how many TENS you have, and not UNITS.) and then i think most people can go from here to solve the rest by themselves with no problems.

When you subtract 2 from 2 you get a 0, then tens place subtract 0 from 1 to get 1 then hundreds place  0 from 3 to get 3 then at thousands place you have to subtract 9 from 4 which is not possible so you borrow from ten thousands place a ten so as we already have a 4 in thousands place after borrowing we will have a 14 now subtract 9 from 14 to get a 5 and finally the ten thousands place it had 7 but as we borrowed from here now we have only 6 so subtract the 4 from 6 to get 2.
