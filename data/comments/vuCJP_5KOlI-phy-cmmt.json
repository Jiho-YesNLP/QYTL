Let\u2019s start with the equation for upper inner loop(loop 1): Pick a starting point and a direction in which you are going to inspect the loop. In this case, they started at a junction next to 20V battery and went left in direction of current (conventional aka hole current) by adding resistor values both 5\u03a9 and 40\u03a9 to the equation #2 like this: 20V-5i2-40i1=0, where 20V is the battery, 5 is the value of the resistor in ohms and i2 is the name of a 2nd parallel wire where this resistor is located.

Also, this time, dividing 20V by 40 \u03a9, we put in use Ohm\u2019s law where I=V/R, so 20/40=0.5A) i1=0.5A-0.125i2 leave this equation for now, we can\u2019t simplify it any more at this moment. Let\u2019s figure out equation 3 for the lower inner loop (loop 2) by starting at the same spot and going left and downwards: 20V-5i2+10V-15i3-25i3=0 30V-5i2-40i3=0 -5i2-40i3=-30V 5i2+40i3=30V (multiply by -1 to get rid of minus sign) 0.125i2+i3=0.75A (again, divide by 40 \u03a9 and use Ohm\u2019s law where appropriate) i3=0.75A-0.125i2 Now equation 1. Remember, as shown in the video that i2=i1+i3, so we can now substitute i1 and i3 with our known values to calculate equation #1 like this: i2=i1+i3 i2=0.5A-0.125i2+0.75A-0.125i2 i2=1.25A-0.25i2 i2+0.25i2=1.25A 1.25i2=1.25A i2=A (1Amp) So, substituting i2 in both previous equations we get this result: i1=0.5A-0.125i2 i1=0.5A-0.125A i1=0.375A i3=0.75A-0.125A i3=0.625A", "votes": "49", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "vuCJP_5KOlI", "cid": "Ugw__DNip7GtZbxs0OZ4AaABAg.8iSgQjKfltk9A3xiDjSNCc", "comment": "\u00a0@martinsbeitans5179\u00a0 You sir are amazing!

In the circuit we have resistor 1 (40 Ohms) and resistor 2 (5 Ohms). because of Ohm's law, to find the voltage, we multiply the resistance times the current, so:             R1*i1 + R2*i2 = 20 amp\u00e9res (the voltage of the battery)   if we substitute the value of R1 and R2 for it's values, we have:               40i1 + 5i2 = 20A   If we move 5i2 to the other side:               40i1 = 20A - 5i2   If we divide all the values for 40, we have:               i1 =  20/40A - 5/40i2             i1 =  1/2A - 1/8i2   I hope I've helped!
