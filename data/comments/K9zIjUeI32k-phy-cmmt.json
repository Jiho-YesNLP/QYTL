And it is incorrect when he says the force is approximately mv2/r but if it moves slowly it is the root-square norm of mg and mv2/r. That is incorrect. The correct answer is that the mv2/r force is equal and only equal to the net force of all centripedal and cetrifugal forces(radial forces). So the forces that are perpendicular to radius (angular forces) are not considered in the formula. Therefore, for any arbitrary point with an angle \\theta from the negative y axis, the tension force will be T= mgcos(\\tetha) + mv2/r and there is also an angular force of -mgsin(\\theta) perpendicular to radius, which does not have anything to do with the tension because it is orthogonal to the rope. Its job is to slow down the ball as it is going upwards so the one who is rotating the ball should increase the speed of movement manually. Getting back to the formula T= mgcos(\\tetha) + mv2/r, when the \\theta becomes 90 degrees which is at the middle point the T=mv2/r.", "votes": "16", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "K9zIjUeI32k", "cid": "UgzfHXVtmxNqfA62Uct4AaABAg", "comment": "what if only given revolutions and time to find tension force?(revolutions mean the rotations)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "K9zIjUeI32k", "cid": "UgwT_KsLEjLWfsgXR994AaABAg", "comment": "OMG!
