At 9:56 she highlights around every polar bond in vitamins A & B9, and EVERY oxygen is boxed (but interestingly not every O-C bond. Carbon attached to a hydroxyl Oxygen were not boxed. It appears possible the boxes may have been originally placed around functional groups: Amine, Carboxyl, Carbonyl, Hydroxyl; and then the diagram was repurposed for this lecture. According to this lecturer, it seems every C-O bond is polar except for CO2 where the Oxygen double bonds on both sides of the carbon act to cancel each other's effect out.
