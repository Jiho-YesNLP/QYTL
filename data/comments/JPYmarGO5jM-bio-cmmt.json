Eventually, the story came out that he'd cut off by a vehicle in traffic and road rage followed. The woman driving the other car got out and berated him. He got out of his car, shot her to death and then killed her two children and husband.   Knowledge of that horrific act takes all the humor out of the academic example.

There's another piece of evidence that this vocal style must express some deep need of our Incredibly Learned Professor's psychological make-up. On one of his videos, there's a comment that Prof. Sapolsky, around the time of his PhD, changed university because he had not been allowed to teach. I don't remember exactly the video, and I don't remember either Prof. Sapolsky mentioning this incident in one of his books I've read. It could have been buried in one note of those books, or revealed \"en passant\" in one of his lectures. This fact should be traceable. It's most certain that his wife must be fully aware of his penchant to go on lengthy \"tirades\" on subjects he takes passionately to heart. If you read his seven books (including the last two editions of the ZEBRAS book), you cannot fail to become familiar with some of his favorite obsessive ideas, as they are rehashed repeatedly in all kinds of variations. He is basically a do-gooder, an optimist, yearning for the better-being of humans, according to some high-level expectations. In his lectures, he often marks his distaste of some  neurobiological or psychological fact with a sharp \"How depressing\", and some hand gesture expressing his resignation or consternation at the wicked unfairness of life. It is this passionate involvement in his topics that mesmerizes his students, who immediately vote him \"the best teacher ever\" (as if, at their age, their sample of a couple or a few more teachers, mostly in high school, should provide a decisive measure). Many of his own comments in his books are in the same vein, expressions of his personal values. The challenge for Prof. Sapolsky as a scientist is to maintain his objectivity, as far as possible, especially when the facts go contrary to his personal preferences. Aristotle, a realist par excellence, would have been skeptical. Can we all hope to reach \"the good\"? Or is it not more reasonable to accept that ills, diseases, violence, and monstrosities will remain an integral part of the life show, including the human one, however deeply we may lament this \"depressing\" inevitability?

Each lecture is a tour-de-force. There's this amazing psychological trait of breath-taking rhetorical creativity, this outpouring of words, an unstoppable torrent of sharply clearly articulated sentences, with practically never a pause or hesitation for a breath in between. Except when, carried away by his own flow, he's occasionally lost the thread of his organized notes all spread out on the desk as guideposts to his unceasing scholarly rambling; or when he decides in a flash of instant reflection to omit one point, and develop another one instead.\u00a0 Think of him as a rocket speeding towards some distant target while surveying a new territory in space. These notes play an important function in his progression. They act as energy boosters of his trajectory. He needs only one glance at the sheets on the desk, and each key concept or fact outlined there on paper refuels his impetus for the next breathless segment of his flow. Alternatively, he simply writes the list of his guideposts on the chalkboard. And there are enough such markers  on his papers or the board to keep him going unstoppably for a full 1h 45' if need be. All this in his continuous rush to push all the words out as fast as possible, as a train on a track buzzing forward at full speed without any apparent clear end station in sight, but always firmly controlled and stabilized by the rails.\u00a0 Any slight break, if it comes, is barely perceptible, perhaps a second or so, and the torrent surges ahead with renewed vigor, without ever showing a sign of reaching the bottom of his supply of energy. While intermingling, without any marked break, some amusing remark or ironical comment on some claims that he likes first to extoll to the skyes to immediately reveal them, in a kind of scientific Schadenfreude, as  false or fraudulent. All this, always without ever breaking his stride, taking an audible breath, and slowing down his speed.\u00a0 Occasionally there\u2019s a marked halt in the unending flow. Stopping to peer more intently at his notes for the following point to embrace, Professor Sapolsky seems to hesitate for a moment, debating in his mind, and pondering on the best way to proceed. He has a quick change of mind, seeming to mumble to himself, but loud enough for this apart\u00e9 to be audible to all, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go into that.\u201d We're immensely lucky to have the transcription in full on the  screen as subtitles skillfully matched to the delivery. There must be some term in psychology for this breathless style of unstoppable oral delivery, with no confusion, no hesitation, no apparent mistake, but one that leaves us exhaustingly striving to keep up, with barely the time to  absorb all his words and retain all the insights of his precise and fluid argumentation. P.S. I think the word is \"tirade\". In fact, in one lecture, when he feels his rocket is going off trajectory, he catches himself, mumbling something like \"enough, I feel I'm starting on a tirade\". So he does feel when his engine is revving up out of control.  I'll correct the quotation once I locate again precisely that moment in one of the 27 lectures. Do note that our Incredibly Learned Professor is widely known in the neurobiology community for his unique, amazing style of oral presentation.\u00a0And, like a runner who feels free and joyful, and in touch with himself, whenever he can get out in the park for his morning jogging,  it is easy to suspect that our Professor must derive immense personal satisfaction whenever he can give his mind a chance to deploy its spectacular verbal flow and energy.

I was in foster-care, we get tested.. I had more issues with PTSD than \"because I'm smart\" but there was a time I would have confused the two. \"Smart\" is relative too. It doesn't say much about how well we function otherwise. Only about potential functioning.   It is pretty easy to say issues stem from being \"too smart\" but that is only really true before hitting college, and if there aren't any other hindrances.   It is also a good reason to let younger students ready for the material take college classes. The sooner they can see what a future class might look like, the more likely they are not to drop out before that, and the percentage of truly gifted students who do drop out is kind of staggering.  Most schools don't have time for those kids though. Special education is only for the folks behind in class after all...   So yeah.. until you can access higher education, that's more of less true. After that though, most intelligent people finally get to fly if you get what I mean.  On the other hand, it's also kind of cheap to attribute all issues a person might have to being \"smarter than average\" though.   It's like the \"burden\" of being \"pretty\". Can it be a disadvantage in individual situations? Absolutely. On the whole though, it is likely more to people's benefit than to their detriment.   If you kind of recognize yourself here.. Find a good therapist and move on to college. Once you get there, work on quality before quantity when it comes to coursework. It will open doors for you.   Decide who and what you want to be. What you want to do with your life.   Chances are, you'll be able to accomplish it even with perfectly average intelligence, never mind if you are a little above average.

Well, a few things to go into there: a.  Society puts animals to sleep who are suffering, and call it 'humane', and yet keep humans alive no matter how much they are suffering.  b.  And yes, many people commit suicide, even if it's illegal.  But, why is suicide illegal?  And if not legal, then why then at least not illegal?  c.  Nobody as far as I know asked to be born and to live.  So why are people forced to stay alive?  It's the individual's own life, isn't it?  d.  Wars kill people too, so why aren't all wars illegal?  Pro-lifers are against abortion, but yet how many of them speak out against all wars?  Especially wars by choice?  e.  Currently, here in the USA, the Republican party, with Trump as their lead, are doing away with social supports for the American people in mass.  Many people that are literally going to die without that support.  How is that not 'murder'?  A Republican party with large 'Christian' support too.  So, are 'Christians' supporting murderers?  f.  (Copy and paste from my files): Consider the following:  Here in America:  Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\r If an American citizen does not have the legal 'Liberty' to end their own 'Life' if they and they alone believe it would make them 'Happy' to do so, then are they truly 'Free'?\r \r \r If an American citizen does not have the legal 'Liberty' to end their own 'Life' if they and they alone believe it would make them 'Happy' to do so, then they are nothing more than a slave to the larger society.  Humanity puts animals to sleep who are suffering and call it 'humane' and yet keep humans alive no matter how much the human might be suffering and who wants to die.\r \r \r If a person wanted to die, and was allowed to legally die, then that would also allow more resources to be left for those people who wanted to continue to live.  Dying can be a charitable act to those who want to continue to live.\r \r \r Legalize suicide or at least make suicide not illegal.  There are at least 6 US States that have legal suicide in some form, but why not all?\r   g.  (Copy and paste from my files): Consider the following:\r *  There are 3 basic options for life itself, which reduce down to 2, which reduce down to only 1:\r a.  We truly have some sort of actual conscious existence throughout all of future eternity.\r b.  We die trying to truly have some sort of actual conscious existence throughout all of future eternity.\r c.  We die not trying to truly have some sort of actual conscious existence throughout all of future eternity.\r \r *  3 reduced down to 2:\r a.  We truly have some sort of actual conscious existence throughout all of future eternity.\r b.  We don't.  And note, two out of the three options above, we die.\r \r *  2 reduced down to 1:\r a.  We truly have some sort of actual conscious existence throughout all of future eternity.\r b.  We truly don't have any conscious existence throughout all of future eternity.\r (And note, these two appear to be mutually exclusive.  Only one way would be really true.)\r   And then ask yourself the following questions:\r 1.  Ask yourself:  How exactly do galaxies form?  The current narrative is that matter, via gravity, attracts other matter.  The electric universe model also includes universal plasma currents.\r \r 2.  Ask yourself:  How exactly do galaxies become spiral shaped in a cause and effect state of existence?  At least one way would be orbital velocity of matter with at least gravity acting upon that matter, would cause a spiral shaped effect.  The electric universe model also includes energy input into the galaxy, which spiral towards the galactic center, which then gets thrust out from the center, at about 90 degrees from the input.\r \r 3.  Ask yourself:  What does that mean for a solar system that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy?  Most probably that solar system would be getting pulled toward the galactic gravitational center.\r \r 4.  Ask yourself:  What does that mean for species that exist on a planet, that exists in a solar system, that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy, in an apparent cause and effect state of existence?  Most probably that if those species don't get off of that planet, and out of that solar system, and probably out of that galaxy too, (if it's even actually possible to do for various reasons), then they are all going to die one day from something and go extinct with probably no conscious entities left from that planet to care that they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less whatever they did and or didn't do with their time of existence.\r \r 5.  Ask yourself:  For those who might make it out of this galaxy, (here again, assuming it could actually be done for various reasons), where to go to next, how long to get there, how to safely land, and then, what's next?  Hopefully they didn't land in another spiral shaped galaxy or a galaxy that would become spiral shaped one day, otherwise, they would have to galaxy hop through the universe to stay alive, otherwise, they still die one day from something with no conscious entities being left from the original planet to care they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less that they made it out of their own galaxy.  They failed to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity.\r \r 6.  Ask yourself:  What exactly matters throughout all of future eternity and to whom does it exactly and eternally matter to?\r \r Either at least one species truly consciously survives throughout all of future eternity somehow, someway, somewhere, in some state of existence, even if only by a continuous succession of ever evolving species, for life itself to have continued meaning and purpose to, OR none do and life itself is all ultimately meaningless in the grandest scheme of things.\r \r Our true destiny currently appears to be:\r 1.  We are ALL going to die one day from something.\r 2.  We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced.\r 3.  We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.\r \r Currently:\r Nature is our greatest ally in so far as Nature gives us life and a place to live it, AND Nature is also our greatest enemy that is going to take it all away.  (OSICA)\r \r *  (Note:  This includes the rich, powerful, and those who believe in the right to life and the sanctity of human life.  God does not actually exist and Nature is not biased other than as Nature.  Nature does what Nature does in a cause and effect kind of way.  Truth is still truth and reality is still reality, regardless of whatever we believe that reality to be.  And denying future reality will not make future reality any less real in a cause and effect state of existence.)\r \r **  Hence also though, legalizing suicide (or at least make suicide not illegal) so as to let people leave this life on their own terms if they wish to do so.  Many people and species are going to die in the 6th mass extinction event that has already started, at least some, horrible deaths.  Many will wish they could die, and all will, eventually.  And the 6th mass extinction event will not be the last mass extinction event for this Earth.  But if suicide were legal (or at least not illegal), at least some people would not have the added guilt of breaking societies' law before doing so.  Just trying to plan ahead here.  Giving people an 'out' if they wish to take it.\r \r Added Note:  As this is a search for the real absolute truth concerning the future, please feel free to copy and paste this elsewhere to further the analysis and discussion.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "JPYmarGO5jM", "cid": "UgzgXrnrZZaNUJdyV1x4AaABAg.8nWsAUzf2z29EWp0ZWSvWx", "comment": "@o. t. Life itself only matters to life itself, only as long as life itself still exists.  It's just that life itself is not always going to exist, at least not from this Earth.  Or so the current analysis would indicate.  ONLY those species who make it off of this Earth, out of this solar system, and out of this galaxy too one day, (if it's even actually possible to do for various reasons), might continue to survive.  Everybody else is going to die and go extinct.  Currently, no exceptions.  It's currently highly possible that we were all destined to die and go extinct even before we even ever existed.  We never had a chance to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity.  God is just a concept, truth is still truth and reality is still reality in this apparent cause and effect state of existence that we appear are all existing in.  And denying future reality will not make future reality any less real.  As far as religion goes, here is my current view, (subject to change as new evidence might dictate):  (Copy and paste from my files):  GOD DOES NOT ACTUALLY EXIST EXCEPT FOR AS A CONCEPT:\r \r For those who claim God actually exists (besides as a concept), consider the following:\r a.  An actual eternally existent absolute somethingness truly existing.\r b.  An actual eternally existent absolute somethingness that has consciousness, memories and thoughts truly existing.\r \r People who claim God actually and eternally exists basically are claiming that 'b' above is correct but yet simultaneously seem to be saying that 'a' is impossible to occur.\r \r 'a' above can exist without 'b' existing but 'b' cannot exist unless 'a' exists.  Even per the scientific principal of Occam's razor, 'a' is more probable of being really true rather than 'b'.\r \r I am one step away from proving God's existence, but am unable to find any actual evidence to do so.  And nobody I've talked to seems to have any actual evidence of God's actual existence either.  All humans appear to have are 'Theories of God'.  Some humans appear to go their whole life basing their life upon their specific theory of God.  They even at times kill other humans based upon their own theories.  Many give their God human characteristics and cannot even prove the existence of their God much less the characteristics given to their God.  Some have circumstantial arguments for a God's existence, but others have circumstantial arguments for no God existing.  Not one has any actual factual evidence that their God actually factually even exists.  Hence, at this time in the analysis, God does not actually exist except for as a concept created by humans for humans.  Humans have personified Nature and called that personification \"God\".  It appears many of them are delusional and are believing in fairy tales as if those fairy tales were really true.  Instead of what is claimed \"God creating man in God's image\", it's more likely that \"Man created God in Man's image\".\r \r Further consider that if the emotional parts of the brain override the logic and reasoning parts of the brain, people can be made to believe bascially anything at all as being really true.  Plus modern science has already proven that humans can have visual and audio hallucinations that are very real to that individual.  All the more reason for critical thinking being needed and to follow the facts wherever those facts might lead.\r \r In addition, while modern science does not know what consciousness actually is yet, memories and thoughts appear to require a physical correctly functioning brain to have those items occur.  Where is God's brain?  Where are God's memories stored at?  How are God's memories stored and retrieved?  How does God think even a single coherent thought?\r \r If inside of this space time dimension we appear are existing in, then where?\r If outside of this space time dimension we appear are existing in, then where is the interface between that dimension and this dimension?  No such interface has been discovered as of yet as far as I am currently aware of.\r \r *  Note:  Since this is a search for the real absolute truth concerning God, Intelligent Designer, Pre-existent Consciousness, etc, feel free to copy and paste this elsewhere to further the analysis and discussion.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "JPYmarGO5jM", "cid": "UgzgXrnrZZaNUJdyV1x4AaABAg.8nWsAUzf2z29acWe_XxOtb", "comment": "I don't think that the legality of the act has any bearing over a person who doesn't want to live.

With age my knowledge has increased and my opinions have changed. Your hate of boxing, thrillers, bloody movies, wrestling or animals killing each other has very little to do with your supposed \"love for a world without violence\". I skip-read through your comments and to me personally (not a professional (yet)) it seems like you mainly dislike the effects of physical violence but are not concerned with violence itself. It seems like trauma which would make sense if your story about you getting beaten up is true. Violence is a natural necessity to establish hierarchies, to establish social constructs, to establish borders, to establish safety, to establish life itself. Destroying forests to make sure people have room to live, wood to burn & build, resources for export, etc. is a type of violence too. Partaking in a clearly structured hierarchical society where you deliberately don't act against the oppressors of others is violence too. Violence is a total necessity. Now accepting this is by no means the same as claiming that we need to be physically violent against each other / have wars etc. It's just broader thinking. In a world without any violence there would be no way to force lazy parasite-type people to carry their own load (and those people would naturally exist). A society without any violence would inevitably collapse since it's not able to function. There needs to be a balance. Humans are \"designed\" for it. Don't get stuck on the physical part of violence but rather take the whole concept of violence into account when thinking philosophically.
