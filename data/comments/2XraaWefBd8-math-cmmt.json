Its just that with the case with three variables the graph could only be represented in four dimensions which is of course impossible to visualize. I say it would be possible to drawn the grad. vector on the curve because when you think of a three dimensional (2 variable) curve you can easily imagine the contours on the graph itself and the gradient vector is perpendicular to those contours and so is perpendicular to the tangent plane at a point on that contour in the 3 dimensional graph. In the case here with the 3 dimensional \"contour' plot for a function with 3 variables imagine one of those \"contours\", the level surface. On this level surface defined by w=c (e.g. x^2+y^3-z=3) there are infinite 2-d curves and thus at any one point on the surface there are infinite tangents to these 2-d level curves, the fact that there are infinite tangents means that the velocity vector (dr/dt) lies in the tangent plane to the level curve. Since we set w equal to a constant to get a level curve, dw/dt is always 0 and hence [gradient vector DOT PRODUCT dr/dt] is always 0. So this means that the gradient vector is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, which lies in a tangent plane to the level surface and so the gradient vector is always perpendicular to the tangent plane to the level surface.
