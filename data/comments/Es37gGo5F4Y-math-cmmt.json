The x-intercept is at -5. There are 2 asymptotes at x=-2 and x=2. The function curve is in 3 sections. I don't think there are any shortcuts to plotting a lot of values for x to be sure where the curves lie. I ended up plotting x = -10, -3, -2.1, -1.9, -1, 0, 1, 1.9, 2.1, 3 and 10. The 2nd comprehension is a bit easier. The x-intercept is at -1. Single asymptote at x=5. Function curve in 2 sections which you can estimate with a few points.
