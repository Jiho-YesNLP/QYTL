Somehow, I think the equations are wrong, Here's what I think. You have 1$. You go and buy bread. 1$ = 1 bread. You have 1$. You go and invest. After a day, if everything goes really well, you get 2 $. But 1$ != 2$. So, during that time, something happened to the dollar. What exactly happened? Well, the value of the stocks fluctuated. Because of the fluctuation, the stocks you invested in gained more value. So, the value of the $ you invested represents a function that describes the fluctuation. But since it represents something different than the $ you used to buy bread, it's not correct to use the same sign. You can't use the same notation for something that represents a fluctuation and also something that represent value at a given moment. So, in order for this to make sense, you need to consider that the $ you use to invest is actually d$/dt. A derivative.

New instructors focus on foundational math concepts, preparing students for industry examples. 02:43 The course aims to provide a sampling menu of how mathematics is applied in modern finance, helping students decide on a potential career path. Students may solidify math knowledge, and last year's attendees secured jobs in the industry. 06:27 The instructor shares a personal story about joining Morgan Stanley's options trading desk in the '90s, highlighting the evolving nature of quantitative finance and the importance of adapting to changing industry terminology. 11:11 Quantitative finance is a relatively new field, transforming over the last 30 years. The instructor emphasizes understanding how concepts are established and verified due to the rapid changes in participants, products, models, and methodologies. 12:03 The instructor provides an overview of different forms of trading, including stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and derivatives. He explains the need for financial markets to bridge the gap between lenders and borrowers. 19:25 After the Glass-Steagall repeal in 1999, banks are organized into institutional client business, including fixed income, equity, and investment banking division. Asset managers, hedge funds, private equity, governments, and corporations are significant market players. 26:25 Types of trading include hedging, speculation, arbitrage, and market making. Different market participants, such as banks, brokers, individual investors, hedge funds, and governments, play various roles in the financial markets. 26:55 Hedging involves managing exposure to risks, such as interest rate or currency fluctuations. It includes locking rates or using derivatives to mitigate potential losses. 27:53 Market makers earn profits by capturing bid-offer spreads. They optimize trades and manage residual risks. Many bank dealers operate as market makers. 28:21 Proprietary traders, like hedge funds, focus on generating returns and controlling risks. Concepts like beta and alpha help in portfolio management, aiming to outperform market indices. 29:45 Beta represents correlated moves with another asset, while alpha denotes the difference in returns. Portfolio managers seek a balance between tracking an index and achieving higher returns. 30:13 Hedging can involve various financial instruments, such as currency forward contracts or interest rate swaps, tomanage risks associated with imports, exports, or investments. 33:58 Risk management is crucial for corporations with overseas operations, facing currency and interest rate exposure. It extends to merger deals and balancing assets, liabilities, and balance sheets. 34:53 Market makers manage risk through Greeks like delta, gamma, theta, and vega. They use value at risk (VaR), assess tail risks, and consider capital and leverage in risk management. 37:12 Proprietary trading involves various strategies like directional trading, arbitrage, systematic trading, fundamental analysis, and special situations. Strategies may require constant adjustment and upgrading. 40:59 Mathematics plays a crucial role in finance, particularly in pricing models for financial instruments, risk management, and the development of trading strategies. 44:16 Risk aversion is a common behavioral trait where individuals may prefer uncertain gains over certain losses, influencing decision-making in financial markets. 49:29 Decision-making in finance depends on factors like risk tolerance, financial situation, and individual preferences. There is no universally right or wrong choice, and context matters in making financial decisions. 52:24 Understanding deterministic versus statistical relationships in trading models is essential. Applying financial theories in real-world risk management and trading requires a balance, and oversimplification should be avoided. 53:23 Homework suggestion: Explore the financial glossary on the course website to familiarize yourself with key terms. Compile a list of financial concepts, seek understanding, and engage in further readings to prepare for the course. 54:16 Vasily shares real-world projects, including estimating noisy derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and optimizing shift size for better numerical derivatives. Another project involves using Kalman filters to predict exchange rates for electronic trading. 59:38 The course website is a valuable resource, containing the syllabus, literature, and lecture materials. Students are encouraged to sign up for announcements and check the website for updates.

He then asks the students a few questions to get a sense of their backgrounds.\r \r The speaker then tells a story about his first day at Morgan Stanley, when he was asked to find the \"vega report.\" He didn't know what vega was, so he asked his desk quant. The quant told him that vega is a measure of a portfolio's sensitivity to volatility.\r \r The speaker then goes on to discuss some of the basic concepts of financial markets, such as exchanges, products, and currencies. He also talks about how financial markets have changed over time, with the rise of electronic trading platforms and over-the-counter trading.\r \r The speaker then gives an example of how mathematics is used in finance. He asks the students to imagine that they have a stock that is currently trading at $88. The stock has a 20% chance of going up to $100 and an 80% chance of going down to $50. The speaker asks the students whether they would rather sell the stock now or wait until the end of the year.\r \r The speaker then discusses the concept of risk tolerance. He says that the answer to the question of whether to sell the stock now or wait until the end of the year depends on the individual's risk tolerance. Someone who is risk-averse would be more likely to sell the stock now, while someone who is more risk-tolerant would be more likely to wait until the end of the year.\r \r The speaker concludes the video by encouraging the students to learn more about the financial markets and the application of mathematics in finance.

Probably the age of many of these kids. Since, I\u2019ve done construction work, went to school, made a million on the stock market, and loss a lot the stock market. I chase girls less and less (I was super successful back then) and care about things like getting the community down to city hall to vote, and voice concerns. Rebuilding the family home structure. Stuff like that. Logical ways to fight gentrification. Mental health. And a bunch of things that I don\u2019t care for when I was younger. No kids yet but on a regular basis I daydream about setting up a great life to bring them in. I\u2019ve been waiting just for that. My family (I have what\u2019s considered a super family Great Grandma and her siblings children etc are all really close and have lived in the same city/area of Florida since the 1920s). I\u2019m often questioned when I\u2019m finally going to have children. In my city I\u2019m considered a late bloomer. From the 90s I had video games. Gameboy, original Xbox, ps2\u2026 it\u2019s been years since I played video games. Last one I had was the switch. My love for smash bros since the very first one released never faded. Haven\u2019t played it in years tho. I don\u2019t watch TV although that was something I stopped doing back when I was 18. When I got my own apartment I had a good 2yr run where I watched movies and shows. But since it fizzled out. My interest is more about learning. On days I don\u2019t learn something I get antsy and extremely bored. I have to learn something. I don\u2019t box in what that may be. Of course my primary focus is on anything related to the stock market. Gaining a deeper understanding. A better comprehension. I missed the college experience, I was deployed in Iraq at 18, and every now and then I feel the sting of jealousy. A lot of it just had to do with some past romantic interests being too heavily tied in with their college crowd even after they graduated. Eventually ruining our relationship. I never miss being in the army. I used to years ago only because I missed the ease of access to women. Military women to be precise. Good looking, healthy and fit, and not money hungry like these chicks in South Florida. That was years ago. Currently in school thanks to gi bill, for something creative focused as opposed to mathematical or engineering. I know, I\u2019ve heard about wasting educational opportunity. I am in a blessed position to be able to venture into this educational choice with limited backlash. My school is paid for, I get paid to go to school, I made a lot of money on the market, I\u2019m service connected by the VA. And I also have a well thought out plan on how I intend on using the connections going to this type of school gives me. A plan that\u2019s been refined over and over, for years. It\u2019s about 6:13am over here now.

Wall St purchased the Rating Companies which rated CDO , collateralized debt umbilications .. The wanted to pump the markets with BAD / TOXIC DEBT .. This was all planned after they got Glass Steagall rescinded in 1999 .. The Ratings companies were rating debt as Triple A .. The number of derivatives that were misrated  was 85% of all the derivatives Market .. The Wall St bankers purposely caused this bubble specifically for the defaults on derivatives .. The People applying for loans were given high credit ratings who were not deserving of such .. Banks also pushed variable loans for those who could not carry the debt if it went over 1.5% .. So when you examine all the facts you now see a system that was made to crash , purposely crashed & was bailed out by the U.S. Tax Payers .. Obama was told => We Wall St Banksters are too big to fail , bail us out or else <= .. The banks threatened to close all the store fronts everywhere if the American Tax Payer not pay off the banks .. Mind you , when it comes to bad debt like this , insurance companies are supposed to pay in this regard for a case of unforeseeable debts .. The Insurance companies did not pay & you little guppies with your mouth wide open want to know why ? .. The insurance companies didn't pay because they had the Wall St Bankers dead to rights .. Its called rigging the game , malfeasance , & outright criminality .. The man teaching the class doesn't want to get black balled from the industry so the instructor in the video does not tell you what I have just told you .. It is your job to ensure that DeFi Comes .. I am currently earning 12% on a crypto digital asset .. I could go for something with more risk but I choose not to .. The reason why you don't know about why banks no longer pay anyone interest should pique your interests .. But for most of you it won't .. You'll go aimlessly on a path to earn money & not ask questions .. There is a question you should ask .. Why are 80% of U.S. $!00 dollar bills outside this country .. Why are 95% made of the old style of $100 bills that are of the old type .. To this I will tell you that the Massive Number of $1, $5, ,& $10's have been sucked up and moved outside the country .. Your mind should immediately move to the obvious , counterfeiting .. The advanced security features in the new $100's make them very hard to reproduce .. So we have counterfeiting operations outside the U.S. .. We also have counterfeiting by institutions .. They counterfeit dollars all the time .. Everytime a loan is created they counterfeit money to cover that debt .. The banks dont't have collateral , they never did , what they have been able to do is cheat the world with fake money .. Sir Godfrey Bloom Explains .. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzX3YZoMrs&t=1s   When those who teach you about Banking , Securities , & asset management don't teach you that your naively becoming a part of a criminal organization .. M.I.T. teaches you to become crooks & thieves without consequence .. You guppies eat this up , as smart as you are , your really stupid for not wanting to know the bigger picture .. When you finally discover that your a low down dirty crook like the banks you work for you either do one of two things .. You either embrace the darkness or you keep you mouths shut & move on .. It should have been the responsibility of the instructor of the video to teach you about the new movement called DeFi'ance ..

He sees the recent consolidation above this level as a good sign for his short-term outlook and could indicate that significant further gains are imminent in the coming weeks and months.
