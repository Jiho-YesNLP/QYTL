What he said was it was too complicated for him to look our papers. Idk what to say to him, he's a registered and topnotcher on board exam, way back 90s. He just invalidate our reasons. We are not taught in school these calculus things, we are just given the coverage and after a few weeks he gives the test. No teaching, we are purely self-paced learning.
