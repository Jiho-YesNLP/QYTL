Consider a circle with a radius R, which has area A = pi*R^2.  Now add a thin ring of thickness \u2206R onto the circumference of this circle.  The area of this thin ring, which we will call \u2206A is equal to the new area of the circle minus the original area of the circle: \u2206A = pi*(R+\u2206R)^2 - A \u2206A = pi*(R+\u2206R)^2 - pi*R^2 \u2206A = pi*R^2 + 2*pi*R*\u2206R + pi*\u2206R^2 - pi*R^2 \r \u2206A = pi*R^2 + 2*pi*R*\u2206R + pi*\u2206R^2 - pi*R^2\r \r \u2206A = 2*pi*R*\u2206R + pi*\u2206R^2  We are interest \u2206A/\u2206R, in the limit as \u2206R gets small.  Divide thru by \u2206R: \u2206A/\u2206R = (2*pi*R*\u2206R + pi*\u2206R^2 )/\u2206R\r \u2206A/\u2206R = 2*pi*R + pi*\u2206R  Taking the limit as \r\u2206R gets small, \u2206R is negligibly small relative to 2*pi*R.  We now call the limit dA/dR, which is the rate of change of the area of the circle, relative to its radius. dA/dR = lim as \u2206R ->0 of  2*pi*R + pi*\u2206R dA/dR = 2*pi*R", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "j6I3EXiKB2A", "cid": "Ugwn4aJ-es-FrXUxV9V4AaABAg.97JZmlY2we49QmsK35pwp5", "comment": "You can also visualize this, by realizing that in the limit as the thin ring gets as thin as possible, the thin ring is equivalent in area to a rectangle whose long side is the circumference of the circle, and whose short side is the thickness of the ring.  For a thick ring, this would really be a trapezoid, with an altitude of \u2206R, and with base 1 equal to 2*pi*R, and base 2 equal to 2*pi*(R + \u2206R).  In the limit as \u2206R gets small, 2*pi*(R+\u2206R) is close enough to 2*pi*R, that you can neglect the slight difference.  So as you can see, the circumference is the rate of change in area relative to the radius.   Likewise, a sphere's surface area is the rate of change in volume, relative to the radius.
