Now, that I'm back in the US I\u2019ve realized just how much that year had set me behind. My 7th grade year was full of anxiety and stress about math. Whenever I tried to understand what was going on in class, I just couldn\u2019t get it. I am determined to fix this, so I can no longer feel inferior to my classmates, but just so i can be a good student and get good grades! Thank you so much for this opportunity.

My tip is to put the patreon tag or link on your channel art background. You could check my page out as reference if you'd like.  And even making a quick 3 minute video about what a patreon is and how it works could also help drive people to becoming a patron. Also, most of your viewers are high school/college students, so having a lower tier for support might be a good idea. You are very popular in the field of science (At least at Auburn University Chem Dept), so don't get discouraged. I hope you have a good one Prof Dave.  -Josh", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AkWtUOwlUgs", "cid": "Ugx5hgrzXPSZE61Ap-R4AaABAg.8W2qTtS7hwv8W3yEl829ym", "comment": "oh wow i didn't even know you could do that!!! thank you so much for this tip. hopefully i can figure out how to get that on mine.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
