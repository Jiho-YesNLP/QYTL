We didn't learn calculus. In university I had an attempted introduction at linear algebra and I didn't understand a word from my professor. I bailed math and decided not to return until I felt ready. Now it's 13 years later and I found this series. In over about 2 months, I have watched all 165 videos, done every single end-of-video test, and if one solution was incorrect, I would redo it again while carefully watching instructions or reading about the required methods in the comments. I finished this last one and now I can finally say I've gotten such a greater grasp and appreciation of math than I ever could have imagined. If this series should continue and encompass more of university-level math, I would be very thrilled for it.
