This allows life above and beneath the ice (as oppose to frozen depths and rising waters)\r \r Water has high heat capacity (how much heat for how long could be soaked and stored by a material), good at holding heat.

When water perspires on my body as sweat, it carries heat. Upon evaporating, the heat leaves and my body becomes cooler.  Water has a high specific heat, allowing it to absorb a good amount of thermal energy. The specific heat of water allows Earth's oceans to absorb heat greenhouse gas emissions. Water's specific heat also makes it a good heat sink in industry.  Solid ice has less density than liquid water, due to the crystal arrangement of molecules in ice.
