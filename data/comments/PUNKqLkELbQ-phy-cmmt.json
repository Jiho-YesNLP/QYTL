Start by focusing on just the bullet+block just after the collision takes place. We know that initially, the potential energy of the bullet+block = 0 since it hasn't gained any height yet. We also know that the final kinetic energy of the system once it reaches the maximum height is also 0 since the bullet+block once again isn't moving. So based on the total mechanical energy theorem, we can say for the bullet+block that 0.5mv^2 = mgh where m is the combined mass of the bullet+block, h is the final height of the block, and v is the initial velocity of the bullet+block just after the collision takes place. This can be simplified to v = sqrt(2gh). Once you solve for v, then you can go back to focusing on the collision, and call the value for v you found the  \"final\" velocity of the bullet+block since it represents the velocity just after the collision happens. Now, this is a momentum problem, since we know that momentum is always conserved for collisions. Thus, to find the initial velocity of the bullet, we can say (m1+m2)vf = m1v1o + m2v2o where m1 is the mass of the bullet, m2 is the mass of the block, vf is the value you found in the first part of the problem which represents the velocity of the bullet and block combined just after the bullet hits,  v1o is the initial velocity of the bullet (which is what you're looking for), and v2o is the initial velocity of the block. Since we know the initial velocity of the block alone is 0, we can simply ignore this term. So the equation becomes: (m1+m2)vf = m1v1o. To solve for v1o, plug in all your numbers, and the number you get represents the initial velocity of the bullet.", "votes": "7", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PUNKqLkELbQ", "cid": "UgyLOyWJDm6xkutHl1p4AaABAg.8fiO5XD3Afo9-M3heJ7J9a", "comment": "Ow..so cute face liaba salman", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PUNKqLkELbQ", "cid": "UgwE80WZ6UBO_eS3om94AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you very much Mr. TOCT I just got full credit back on my FRQ test because of this video, very much appriciate it", "votes": "7", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "PUNKqLkELbQ", "cid": "UgzYKm6TBi-hUdxT4Hx4AaABAg", "comment": "You are a legend.
