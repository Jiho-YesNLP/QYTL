Taking a sweep across all possible directions, you'll see that the maximum possible directional derivative occurs when the direction among the input variables is parallel to the gradient.  To find a directional derivative, you form a unit directional vector, and take its dot product with the gradient vector.  As an example, consider the function z = x^2/8 + y^2/4, at the point (1, 1).  Suppose we're interested in a direction that is along the diagonal of a 3-4-5 triangle, that is roughly 37 degrees from the +x direction.  Our unit directional vector (u) would therefore be given by u = <0.8, 0.6>.   The gradient at this point is <0.5, 0.25>.  So the dot product gives us 0.4 + 0.24 = 0.624.  This is the directional derivative of this particular function.  The maximum possible directional derivative at this point, will have the same direction as the gradient.  Its unit vector will be <2/sqrt(5), 1/sqrt(5)>.  Taking the dot product with the gradient, and we get 0.75/sqrt(5) = 0.335.

When you find the derivative you will get f'(x) = 2x. The plus 2 is a constant and doesn't affect the gradient of the curve. Furthermore if you have a function for example f(x) = 4x^2. The constant at the front (in this case 4) will affect the gradient so doesn't cancel like adding a constant. So the derivative will be f'(x) = 4*2x = 8x.   For partial derivatives of x all you're doing is treating y as a constant. just like the '+ 2' and the '4 * ' in the two examples. So let's suppose you have f(x,y) = xy  + y. From the first example you take the ' + y' as a constant which it's derivative is zero since this won't affect the gradient. While the constant for 'xy' will stay. Making \u2202f/\u2202x = y + 0 = y.
