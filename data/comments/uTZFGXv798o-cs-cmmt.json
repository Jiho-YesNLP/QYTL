Many kinds of data structures exist in different languages. This particular lesson is about the C language, which is a low level language, which means that as a programmer  you have to pay close attention to how you deal with memory. In other languages, similar or different types of data structures may be implemented, whether they're part of the language or an extra functionnality added to it via libraries. To give you an example, Python is quite a high-level language that implements a built-in data structure called 'lists'. Lists in Python don't require you to worry about memory allocation, pointers etc., and provide you with tools (methods) to add, delete, sort or change their contents quite freely, at the cost of performance (the computer has to do the job you don't have to do by organising stuff in the memory).
