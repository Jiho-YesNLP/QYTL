Usually also gravity, in some way, but in exactly what way depends on our current orientation in space. In some scenarios, I imagine it could reduce the amount of force we need to clench our fist. Muscles produce force when they contract initially, but they produce no more force in the desired direction once they are contracted.

Love SciShow and i was so excited to add crashcourse to my watch list! This was a definate win!  Side not /Show Request for here or SciShow.  If the moon rotates around the earth due to the warping of spacetime by the gravitational field, does that mean that the gravity that we feel on earth does the same?
