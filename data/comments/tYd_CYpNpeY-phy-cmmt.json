The pressure inside the sealed rigid container seems to be caused by capturing a sample from the bottom of the 'gas ocean' where the air density is higher causing more molecular collisions with the walls of the container (or a pressure gauge sensor). However, it gets interesting again when we try to apply that explanation to the hydrostatic pressure, as the water density varies insignificantly with depth, yet the pressure inside the rigid container sealed underwater at depth does not disappear.
