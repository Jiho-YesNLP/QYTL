Just do 11 - 5 = 6, then do 6 - 5 = 1, then stop as you know it goes into 11 twice with a remainder of 1. So why does the CPU need to go into negative to calculate that? Unless the negative is a good condition to use as you can say the loop is what decides how often a number goes into another number. So really the computer runs from 0. So 11 - 5 = 6 (0), 6 - 5 = 1 (1), 1 - 5 = -4 (2) and you know that when you get into negative, you've gone too far. So then you add the positive number back again to get to positive which is 1 which is the remainder. Since the computer doesn't intuitively know that 1 is the remainder, then going into a negative could be a good way of getting the computer to go back when it goes too far to get back the same answer.

In Computer Engineering (were I was supposed to entirely learn C+ over a weekend, and NO, I'm NOT kidding) Nobody told me a thing other than that there are \"Registers\" that things get stored in, the assembler turns it all into machine code (and the machine language underneath the hood is written by Magic Elves) and that's that and (much like in The Spy that Shagged Me) When I asked, I should essentially \"just sit back and enjoy the show.\" I didn't. Not one damned bit, and you should excuse the pun. I need to know everything on a fundamental level...Right down to the atoms in the doping of for example, a Transistor, progressing to the \"on\" and \"off\", at the base/gate of the transistor  and build up from there. I don't drive a car or a concept without knowing what's under the hood... (or in this case... Bonnet ;-))  That's how I think: It's how I roll, know what I mean?  So... I just stayed with Heart  Transplant Nursing as a career instead since I already had a degree in that... What I always wondered is if you could have a built in set of \"check\" instructions so if there is an error, say a bit flip or something,  you could instantly clear all of the registers and just reload everything all over again and move forward, or would that be way way too slow and cumbersome?

In the example used in this video you need a single fetch-decode-execute cycle to execute a single instruction. Modern CPUs can actually execute multiple instructions per cycle. And not only because they contain multiple cores. Even a single core can execute multiple instructions per cycle. Modern CPUs are highly pipelined which means that while one instruction is being decoded, the next instruction is already being fetched. Also modern CPUs are superscalar, which means that they contain multiple ALUs and the CPU can dispatch multiple instructions simultaneously to different ALUs.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zltgXvg6r3k", "cid": "UgzTCoJp2k5NsHlEYyB4AaABAg.8sJAv6kafG68tuIKAMhbnM", "comment": "\u00a0@compuholic82\u00a0 okkk thank you for that", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zltgXvg6r3k", "cid": "UgytaQ9WCa7aUv9Di2p4AaABAg", "comment": "Love this Channel sooo much knowledge. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udcbe", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zltgXvg6r3k", "cid": "UgzrZx9iKVPjlhnCTqZ4AaABAg", "comment": "What the CrashCourse has done here is providing a fast and solid introduction to assembly language who I am a newbie at.

Despite staying with the series since the first World History, this is the first time a field that I've actually studied at an undergraduate level is covered. I have a bachelor degree in System Science, which means I've done mostly high level programming and business analysis. I have however taken a few, basic courses in low level computer science. Crash courses if you will ;)  The courses I took were all kind of sheit, it's quite a heavy subject for people more used to social sciences, yet it was awfully administrated and the lecturer sucked. I powered through it but it always felt like a disappointment, since the subject really did interest me and I would have liked to take it on with a little more enthusiasm.  Looking at this I can't help but feel like this is how it's supposed to be done. It really covers all the essentials, without dumbing anything down, and yet manages to make it all crystal clear and understandable. It all adds up to a series that actually engages me in a way that I wish I would have back when I actually studied this.  When it comes down to it, I don't think it's the quirky graphics, occasional pop-culture references or lighthearted presentation that makes up the \"entertainment\" part of well made edutainment (though don't get me wrong, I appreciate that too), but rather the fact that it's presented with clarity, competence and enthusiasm, with a structure that makes it feel meaningful and leaves you wanting more.

Many different conditions can cause a computer to \"lock\" or \"freeze\". The clock not working is only one of them. Other conditions can be the CPU executing an invalid instruction or op code, accessing a memory location that does not exist, a memory chip malfunctions, an expansion board malfunctions, a paper clip falling into the inside of the computer causing a short, or pulling an expansion board out of a computer while it is running, In the case of the Mark II computer, Grace Murray Hopper's associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay impeding its operation.

There are only certain levels of abstraction you can think of a computer in.

I worked years in IT, spent my teens programming and wrapped up a degree in computer engineering and still sometimes I fix something and my client goes \"How the hell did you fix that?\" and there are more times than you'd think where I shrug, the senior engineer shrugs, the computer shrugs and the computer god shrugs too.
