Half for opcode, half for RAM addresses? This design would bottleneck how much RAM can actually be used right?  How does a 32 bit processor handle 4GB of RAM if, by this video's CPU design, half of the instruction set is for addresses (32/2 = 16bits, 16 bits = 65000ish addresses?  If the address bus going to the RAM is 4 wires, it can address 16 different addresses in the RAM but if the program instructions are only 8 bits and an instruction is half op code and half memory addresses (4 bits & 4 bits), that would mean this CPU can only handle 16 different addresses with its 8 bit instruction reg. So a program can only be 16 instructions long. Even if the address bus is bigger, say 8 bits wide instead of 4, and now it can handle 256 different addresses of RAM, this CPU's 8 bit instruction reg would then be a bottleneck as it can still only handle 4 bits (16 memory locations) of memory addresses when executing instructions because it's instruction register can only hold 8 bits.   Where I'm coming from is, a 32 bit processor can handle 4GB of RAM addresses. Which means the entire instruction set has to be a memory address. If only half a 32 bit processor instruction reg was used for memory addresses, like in this video's example CPU design, you'd only get 65500-ish memory addresses. Which doesn't make sense because a 32 bit processor can handle 4GB. I know this video is a simple (I use simple loosely) example of the foundational principles of a CPU. I'm trying to bridge a gap in what I'm understanding (hope I'm understanding rather lol) is all. Any help would be appreciated!

It can tell Register A to store what is coming from the memory data pins during one clock cycle and to do nothing in the next clock cycle.  But how it this actually done? There are several circuits that can generate these complicated sequence of signals. One option is called a \"finite state machine\" which has a few storage bits to indicate the \"current state\" and some logic gates that calculate the \"next state\" as well as the values of all the control signals. On each clock the next state value is stored into the current state.  An alternative is to use a memory circuit. This is called a \"microcoded\" design because the memory and the \"microcode counter\" that addresses it are like a very tiny and simple computer inside a larger one. Think of this memory as the cylinder in an ancient mechanical music box where spinning the cylinder is like incrementing the microcode counter and it bit in memory is like a place on the cylinder which may either have a pin to play the corresponding note or may be flat, in which case that particular note doesn't play at that particular moment.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "Ugill-gtT5MNlHgCoAEC.8R43WrsB01c8j2MMsuMQlZ", "comment": "Thank you!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "Ugill-gtT5MNlHgCoAEC.8R43WrsB01c8tui7a2fYZc", "comment": "No", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "UgiZuI3yDXG9KXgCoAEC", "comment": "4 instructions per 6 minutes = 4/360 instructions/second = .01 Hz", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "UgjgxAJO-K7LfXgCoAEC", "comment": "I'm not paid or anything, but to anyone that has fun with those curcuits and likes puzzle-type games, I can recommend the game \"Shenzen I/O\". :) It's pretty much based oncombining basic computing or input / output components and programming them with basic computing commands to solve a puzzle..", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "Ugg2AmtFA_1ckngCoAEC", "comment": "This is amazing.

That scheme would give you access to 4 GB of RAM. Since memory usage is usually clustered together, you wouldn't need to change that \"bookmark\" (segment register) often, most of the time you'd just play around in that one 64k chunk (segment), like it's the only memory you have, then you'd move over to another chunk, etc. You could scale this down a bit if you really want all your instructions to be 16 bit (fit in both the opcode and an address).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "UggzDXLP1HT6-XgCoAEC.8R0-XaCoAV_8R1EUIeeQ5c", "comment": "you could also design your instructions to only fetch 32 bit lines and no smaller. your data would have to stored at addresses that are multiples of four bytes (4\u00d78=32), which means the last two bits of the addresses you can fetch would always be 00. the instruction therefore wouldn't need to specify those two bits, they would be implied, saving two whole bits! yay :)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "FZGugFqdr60", "cid": "UggzDXLP1HT6-XgCoAEC.8R0-XaCoAV_8R1KwFsM_o3", "comment": "You may be interested in downloading a CPU emulator, which will let you experiment with machine and assembly code.

There are other strategies to deal with address, instructions and data. The 8086 (from with the current Intel and Amd desktop chips are decendents) that were a 16 bit CPU uses a 16 bits for receiving data from the CPU and 20 bits to address the memory. I can be wrong, but i think in some architectures is possible that one 'clock' loads the instruction and other clock the address(es), so you could have 256 different instructions and 256 different addresses. Some time ago there are also the concept of segment, if i'm not wrong, first you select a segment, after that the address inside the segment, a segment would be like a district when you send an letter, to use a address from another segment you would need to change the segment first.

So the first byte could be a modifier (e.g. switch the instruction between 16- and 32-bit mode, or between 32- and 64-bit). The next byte is the opcode of the instruction; part of it also might identify the registers involved (e.g. which register is being loaded or stored to memory). The next 4 (or 8) bytes might contain the 32-bit (or 64-bit) memory address involved. Further bytes may involve additional parameters as necessary.  Also, sometimes even more memory addressing is possible via mechanisms like paging. For example, 16-bit CPUs would technically only support 64K of memory, but Intel 8086 could address a whole megabyte by adding extra 16-bit segment registers, whose value would combine with the 16-bit memory offset to form a 20-bit address (the segment value is multiplied by 16 and then added to the offset, thus basically giving you 4 extra bits for a 20-bit effective memory address). So for example, if the segment register contains 0, you're accessing a 16-bit offset into the first 64-kilobyte page of memory. If the segment contains 2000 hex, you're accessing addresses 2XXXX hex (or the third 64-kilobyte page).  32-bit CPUs (Intel 80386) introduced even further levels of indirection by introducing global and local descriptor tables. So for example, now the 16-bit segment register is a \"selector\" (index) into the descriptor table, which contains the 32-bit starting address of the segment into which we're addressing (in theory allowing you to address up to 256T of memory). Different processes could also have different descriptor tables mapping into different physical addresses, so each 32-bit process can address a separate memory space and be isolated from others.

Someone else on here wanted a crash course on sustainable development, but a much better crash course, in terms of transmiting knowledge, would be teaching about development in general with pro-cons of sustainable vs unsustainble forms, and a discussion of the kinds of development that we have used in the past and why.  Same thing here.  Also not to start to debate on Climate Change, but the goverment was never going to fix it. It's structurally impossible. If even 1 goverment in the world cheats, it fails.  The only method of solving it involves the creation of sustainable technology, that is economically viable without subsidy. I can imagine zero laws that fix this, even if you had 100% compliance with those laws across the planet, something that clearly isn't happening. Even Obama's executive orders did little to change this fundemental. Subsidies don't work and could make it worse by propping up bad technologies.   The only goverment action that makes sense is large investments in R&D, but even those need to be structured for break throughs and rapid commerical adoption, which currently is not how research is done. (I'm aping certain green investors like Bill Gates here, who clearly have some street cred when it comes to creating new industries).  A manhatten project, or something like how we did the internet would be the model. Subsidizing growth of companies just creates the next generation of Iowa Corn Farmers in a couple decades, and Ironically, Ethanol  subsidies is a huge boondoggle that actually hurts more than it helps, and swamps any gains made by any sustainable policy.

Multithreaded code is far more difficult to write and therefore less commonly used, which many people use to discount AMD's focus on high thread count. But once you've done the hard work of getting it multithreaded in the first place, it's often trivial to scale thread use based on hardware, so nearly all multithreaded applications are significantly faster on high thread count processors.  But even in games, high core count can be a huge help. For example, my game's n-body gravity and procedural planet generation algorithms are designed to use a flexible thread count, so core count has massive performance impact.
