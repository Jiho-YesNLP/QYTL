Here\u2019s a question I put out in a bunch of YouTube comments regarding irrational numbers.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-  Hopefully someone answers this question.  1:  a rational number is rational because it can be represented by the ratio of any two numbers.   This is what I believe it is.  If I\u2019m wrong please let me know.   so far, this seems reasonable, as a ratio is how any two entities are related, generally speaking.   But take pi, for example.   isn\u2019t pi the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter?  Those are two numbers.  And I can represent pi by those two numbers.  And potentially I can have an infinite set of \u201ccircumference to diameter\u201d ratios to represent pi?  Unless what makes an irrational number irrational is that the resulting ratio is an unending and patternless decimal.   Maybe this latter half is more the definition.   But the problem is why call it irrational?  Irrational suggests \u201cno relation or connection\u201d in that a ratio is how any two or more entities are connected or related generally speaking.   So, my first impulse was to think, ah, irrational numbers must not have ANY ratio of two  numbers that can represent them.   But as with the circumference and diameter, it seems that there can be a whole bunch of pairs of two numbers that can represent Them.    Idk.   What am I missing here?  I may have understood this years ago, but it\u2019s been a long time.    Because so far, it just seems to me that an irrational number is also represented by the ratio of two numbers but that it\u2019s decimal is unending and patternless.", "votes": "1", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QUGmwPwtbpg", "cid": "UgxEMH3l5PCbn_Sb3554AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks very much you are a professional", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QUGmwPwtbpg", "cid": "Ugws0ANW5b44065OCNN4AaABAg", "comment": "I've been struggling at every single lesson in my math class, but when professor dave explains ANYTHING its as easy as 1+1", "votes": "141", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QUGmwPwtbpg", "cid": "UgxNab6mYJYXMisdLrN4AaABAg", "comment": "This video really helped me thank you so much", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QUGmwPwtbpg", "cid": "Ugxf2rlCzzhkJ3awvtR4AaABAg", "comment": "nice one", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QUGmwPwtbpg", "cid": "Ugy9Y3GLGZgYNc3Cy0t4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you!!!

And hopefully we can dialogue about this just for a bit.   So, You mention integers, and whole numbers.    Well, let\u2019s talk about that; what are the various classifications of numbers.   Off the top of my head.  1:  Natural numbers:   Are the counting numbers.  But exclude zero, fractions/decimals and negative numbers.  Probably because it\u2019s more empirical, where zero and negative numbers are more abstract.   2:  Whole numbers:  This includes the natural numbers and also includes zero.   but still excludes fractions, decimals and negatives   3: Integers:  include what it means to be natural and whole numbers, but also includes negatives. But still excludes fractions and decimals.   4: Rational numbers: I thought included all of the above but also includes fractions and decimals.

I find it interesting that as a student of philosophy you are more intellectually positioned to satisfactorily answer your question than a mathematician. As the student of philosophy It would be natural for you to ponder 'which came first' the circle and its diameter or the values and constructs assigned to relationship between them. If the circle and its diameter were first than there was certainly nothing irrational, in the general sense of the word, that could be fairly applied to them. Rather, as you alluded to in your inquiry, that they existed in relationship would in fact argue they were indeed perfectly rational. But consider this: The irrational terminology  is not grounded in relationship but in this case in mathematics. It is used to classify constructs that feature yielding values of pattern-less repeating numbers. The question of why this terminology was used, given that it presses on the general understanding of irrationality, is I believe a quite fair one. It is a question of human experience and choice. But for me, I would be more comfortable having that question answered by a student of philosophy. Anyway, thank you for your curiosity.

No, a number does not have two square roots, and root(4) is not equal to both 2 and \u20132. This is simply incorrect usage of the square root notation. BY DEFINITION, the square root of a real number y is equal to nonnegative real number x such that x^2 = y. This does not mean every solution x to the equation is the square root of y. Only the nonnegative solution is the square root of y. The other solutions is simply denoted with \u2013root(y).

That numbers such as sqrt(2) or \u03c0 are irrational is not because we have checked their decimal expansions and saw no repetition. They are irrational because we can definitely prove they are irrational: we do not need to check their decimal expansions, because we can definitively prove their decimal expansions are not periodic and do not terminate without having to check them: all we need to now is only the definition of the numbers to prove it.  Also, the way \"integers,\" \"whole numbers,\" and \"natural numbers\" were presented was sort of confusing. For one, the set of integers is alos called \"the set of whole numbers\" in most places outside North America, even in places that use the English language, while no analogous distinction between \"natural numbers without 0\" and \"whole numbers (natural numbers with 0)\" exists in countries that do not use English as a language. On the other hand, most mathematicians today, and even authoratitative sources on mathematical notation, such as the ISO 80000-2, use the symbol N to refer to the natural numbers with 0, which in mathematics are just called \"natural numbers.\" The set of natural number without 0 is not really considered any more fundamental than, say, the sequence of Fermat numbers, which is why mathematicians do this. So presenting a distinction between the two sets, especially with this very particular naming convention that is not even used by mathematicians, is definitely going to confuse people, and it could even be considered misleading, although I understand this obviously was not intentional.  I also think it would have been informative to include an additional layer within the set of real numbers, talking about the algebraic numbers and nonalgebraic numbers, since their definition, while a little more complicated, is still intuitive enough to be understood from a simple presentation, and there is merit in doing so due to the historical importance of algebraic numbers and the types of implications it has in, for example, architecture. Even though irrational algebraic numbers cannot be written using finite decimal expansions, they still have decidedly nicer properties than transcendental numbers, making them much more convenient to work with. This also gives context as to why e and \u03c0 are such important constants, but sqrt(3) is not, for example.
