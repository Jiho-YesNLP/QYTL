Selective dog breeding shows rapid physical changes  In a Russian study, selective breeding of dogs has led to major physical changes resembling puppies in merely 30 generations. This highlights how the interplay between genetics and environment can influence traits and drive evolution quickly.  2. Genetic analysis techniques and challenges  Genetic analysis involves observing traits to find genetic differences and understanding variations in phenotype and behavior. Techniques such as RFLP's, microarrays, and QTLs are employed, but challenges include potential incorrect results and ethical dilemmas of testing for incurable diseases.  3. Genes affecting behavior and emotions  Genes such as dopamine, vasopressin, and BDNF affect risk-taking behavior, social affiliation, anxiety, and fear. Studying genetic variations in these genes sheds light on the connection between genetics and behavior and how mutations can be linked to conditions like autism.  4. Role of chance in genetics and behavior  Chance plays a significant role in gene-environment interactions and genetic diversity. This includes mitochondrial DNA sequences, cell division variability, and unpredictable gene interactions during neural stem cell division. Behavior genetics aims to quantify traits using various techniques to better understand this role of chance.  5. Understanding heritability and variability in traits  Heritability is a measure of how much genes contribute to variability in traits. It's determined by examining genetic markers and copy length variants, and ranges from 0% to 100%. Often, environmental factors play a larger role in variability than genetic differences.  6. Gene-environment interaction in heritability  Environment is crucial when analyzing the impact of gene versions on factors like plant IQ. The environment-gene relationship affects the trait, and it's impossible to fully understand a gene's function without considering its interaction with the environment, which can lead to lower heritability.  7. Genes and environment in determining human behavior  Genetic variance in depression is highly dependent on an individual's childhood exposure to glucocorticoids. Heritability studies measure trait variability, not averages, and are influenced by the removal of environmental variability. The gene-environment relationship in human behavior is inseparable, making it a crucial breakthrough in biological psychiatry.  8. Gender differences in math and verbal performance across countries  Gender differences in math performance are affected by societal factors, not inherent sex differences. Greater gender inequality leads to larger math score differences, while more gender-equal societies have smaller or non-existent differences, with females even excelling in verbal performance.  9. Nature and nurture interplay in genes and behavior  The presence of a gene for a specific trait might not necessarily have a direct effect, but could result from indirect genetic effects. Human genes code for ways to have freedom from the effects of genetics, showing the importance of environment in shaping behavior.

Your conclusion is that difference in math skills are different by the country ergo oh damn this must be environmental. Ok What\u2019s in common? They treat differently on different genders so huh we just found the environmental factor see? all genders are equal yey! Do you know what else is also in common Tunisia turkey and south korea? THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS FOLKS maybe not right now but they were ones. And do you know how conservative folks get married? With arranged marriages. And do you know how arranged marriages are done? Do you know how people choose their partners? They don\u2019t. Their family does. My grandma got married with a man she never knew about. And so does my grandpa. She was pretty he had a job and good income.  In conservative societies womens doesn\u2019t gets to be chosen for their math skills or their intelligence. They get choosen because their pretty. But for mens better math skills has better chances of having better jobs etc. my point is evolution worked on different ethnicities in a slightly different way. Yes maybe a environment is also another factor but  not that big as much as 17:1 ratio.  I am born and raised Turkish and i can say that in schools boys treated same as the girls yet boys are much much better at math on average.   Here\u2019s another example.  in turkey womens have an average levels of beauty yet mens are ugly as hell and this is a well known fact. If you\u2019re look at Scandinavian countries there\u2019s no significant beauty difference between men are women. Does that mean oh we should look for environment? Noooo   Your previous deductions on depression etc did made perfect sense. So im not denying the effects of the environment. Im just saying like you said at the start it\u2019s easier to spot the difference in diseases behavior and characteristics are more complicated than that and it can easily be misinterpreted.", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RG5fN6KrDJE", "cid": "UgzuHwy-rSqUMEvUhK14AaABAg.9wlhXKN6mY09wlhadRswvs", "comment": "People emerge in extremes of a probability distribution.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RG5fN6KrDJE", "cid": "UgzNqCccX1r54ZWG_Qp4AaABAg.9tvC0qso6TK9tvDqTW8EJc", "comment": "1:20:48 here it is. didn't guess wrong lol", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RG5fN6KrDJE", "cid": "UgxSN6g6maPLJy64ryR4AaABAg.9r9cIk2fN2r9uHv4ORz0Io", "comment": "No. If we put you in an environment in which you need wings to survive you will simply not survive. :-)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RG5fN6KrDJE", "cid": "Ugx1QL1CBqdQY-NvkKl4AaABAg.9oxSfYiDPJW9snCageG48t", "comment": "Rambling incoherent novel.

Dr. Sapolsky is such a great professor and lecturer! However, in this class, particularly, there was a point that got me worried, which was when he said that antisocial traits would be negatively expressed \"only if\" the mother was cold and withdrawn. This puts all the weight regarding how the child will develop on a mother's shoulders. Would it be appropriate to say that psychopathy will be expressed only in case the mother isn't warm enough? What about the cases in which mass shooting took place and the mother wasn't cold and withdrawn? Would it be right to say the bullying these shooters endured at school was less important of a fact than the love they got from their mothers? Would their mother's love have been enough for them not to have done what they did? What about their siblings who seemed to have had a healthy upbringing? What about other environmental factors, such as the father, the midia, the neighborhood, losses, etc? What about a damaged frontal cortex which prevented them from stopping their actions? Would a mother's love have fixed that? The point I'm trying to make is that there needs to be a more detailed explanation when it comes to putting the weight of such hard issues on somebody's shoulders, specially on mothers', as they've been culturally and unfairly blamed for 'everything that could possibly go wrong' for such a long time and this blame-game effect still remains today. It reminds me of the now debunked theory of the \"refrigerator mother\", which blamed the mothers of autistic kids for causing their autism. Moms of autistic kids still suffer the effects of such nonsense theory these days. They present their child's diagnosis to school only to hear the teachers say their kid behaves like that due to inadequate parenting. Though science has proven it's a genetically-based condition, the parent-blame culture is still very much alive and reinforced by the lack of scientific information within the general public.

It was the reason why women in the past more often didn't even try. It is the same for men now.

His endorsement of the environment is not unfounded and is crucial but its presentation is somewhat far leaning and trashing of genetics (i.e. genes and sex chromosomes) and its interplay with environment. I guess his reason for doing this is to counterbalance societal narratives about the importance of biology and its determinism of behaviour and other traits. Which has and still leads to ideologies that discriminate individuals and groups leading to minor and disastrous consequence. This emphasis needs to be made but also be made modestly, as instead of correcting the capsized boat it could also just go around full circle. Also to note this course is an \"introduction\", not meaning that to trash the professor and his efforts here as they are amazing, but just that these fields as he stated at the start are more broad and nuanced from what he does here. Hence assumptions or generalisations are made in a respect to make it palatable and sometimes this can be affected by bias, as with everything. Harkening back to his rhetoric at the first lecture, these are all small parts of the puzzle each with their own flavours.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27.

An actual eternally existent absolute somethingness truly existing.\r b.  An actual eternally existent absolute somethingness that has consciousness, memories and thoughts truly existing.\r \r People who claim God actually and eternally exists basically are claiming that 'b' above is correct but yet simultaneously seem to be saying that 'a' is impossible to occur.\r \r 'a' above can exist without 'b' existing but 'b' cannot exist unless 'a' exists.  Even per the scientific principal of Occam's razor, 'a' is more probable of being really true rather than 'b'.\r \r I am one step away from proving God's existence, but am unable to find any actual evidence to do so.  And nobody I've talked to seems to have any actual evidence of God's actual existence either.  All humans appear to have are 'Theories of God'.  Some humans appear to go their whole life basing their life upon their specific theory of God.  They even at times kill other humans based upon their own theories.  Many give their God human characteristics and cannot even prove the existence of their God much less the characteristics given to their God.  Some have circumstantial arguments for a God's existence, but others have circumstantial arguments for no God existing.  Not one has any actual factual evidence that their God actually factually even exists.  Hence, at this time in the analysis, God does not actually exist except for as a concept created by humans for humans.  Humans have personified Nature and called that personification \"God\".  It appears many of them are delusional and are believing in fairy tales as if those fairy tales were really true.  Instead of what is claimed \"God creating man in God's image\", it's more likely that \"Man created God in Man's image\".\r \r Further consider that if the emotional parts of the brain override the logic and reasoning parts of the brain, people can be made to believe bascially anything at all as being really true.  Plus modern science has already proven that humans can have visual and audio hallucinations that are very real to that individual.  All the more reason for critical thinking being needed and to follow the facts wherever those facts might lead.\r \r In addition, while modern science does not know what consciousness actually is yet, memories and thoughts appear to require a physical correctly functioning brain to have those items occur.

How does God think even a single coherent thought?\r \r If inside of this space time dimension we appear are existing in, then where?\r If outside of this space time dimension we appear are existing in, then where is the interface between that dimension and this dimension?

I guess this is why any team working on biological behavior has to include a total number-crunching computer programmer or three.   Einstein's stuff on Brownian shows that there is a tendency to remain within some limits - this, too, is important to remember in genetic and biological science:   that limits occur, including the one which Sapolsky has only just touched - optimality vs. the complex constraints he is going through.

It does exist. But I can see why he perceives it as not being there. The statistics will be influenced by the fact that more women than men take a higher education and university degree in Western countries. This means more women will get their mathematical genes more stimulated. Furthermore boys in humans and other animals have to much testosterone in their bodies to be effective learners in a organized cultural transmission. Typically girls do better than boys in school settings where they have to sit still, listen and be quiet for long durations or time. This means that we force boys to not live out their talents as we force them to suffer which will diminish learning. Again, not a similar expression of genes. Furthermore we see many more men taking the math degrees - even though they are outnumbered in nearly all other university degree. Physics, programming and math have a lot of men. Men seem to like sitting alone and calculating things. And more men have really high IQ's. To study math at the university you need to have a very high IQ. So, it's true that more girls than boys get higher grades in pretty much every subject. But using this statistic to say that there is no gender difference in math skills is wrong and bad science. But I do understand that this was not Sapolsky's main claim. His main claim was the fact that environment matters a lot. And it does. Especially if you have an environment that forces individuals to adjust to it. Then some individuals will suffer and not show their true talents.

He misses many things. About the differences in mathematics, the main difference is in INTEREST. Women are less interested in soulless things like numbers or mechanical objects than men. Women are evolved to take care of babies and of female networks needs, while men are evolved to take care of hunting with tools and sharp stones as weapons. Also for physical problems and fast hunting decisions men cannot rely on ambiguity, but clear cut solutions are needed to survive, and this is why men are obsessed with finding absolute truths. Women instead are evolved to solve social and relational problems, where a more conciliatory and accomodating understanding is the most effective approach. Multiple and contradictory truths at the same time are easily contemplated by the female brain, while men find that scenario associated with a negative edonic tone. This is why the edonic drive of female brains is much less stimulated by mathematics. There are also differences in capabilities, but those are much less important than differences in interest. For example: the better matricial memory of women (due to their evolved gatherer specialization in accurate spatial location memory for plants and fruits in the area around the village), and for men the better mental 2D/3D rotations and dynamic predictions of continuous curves (due to their evolved hunter specialization in throwing projectiles to moving targets). Also men are more prone to creativity, because they are risk-takers and instinctively love to break estabilished dogmas and oppose to current authority, because that is the best evolved strategy for climbing the status ladder and showing off with women. Women instead are more conservative and law abiding, because the best strategy for protecting their childs and be sure of being helped during the pregnancy is to not break any taboo and to follow secure and already proven roads.

This variability may be simply due to more male-biased environments. I do acknowledge, however, that any pen-and-paper math any test would have a limited construct validity for math ability (as math has an aesthetic and artistic quality to it). \u00a0 \u00a0Brain scans? What can brain scans say about math ability? An increase in volume of some presumably math centre or something? Or a positive correlation of brain activation and a math task? Even if there were such patterns, they would be correlational. It is just plausible that the environment produced differences in math ability which produced differences in brain connectivity, isn't it? Brain scans are good for helping understand HOW the brain works, but not at all for quantifying the role of genes in the expression of a behavioural trait.  \"Furthermore we see many more men taking the math degrees - even though they are outnumbered in nearly all other university degree.\" \u00a0-- This might support your point, but it also might reflect the gender-bias (i.e. environment). A simple way to settle the question would be to look at the proclaimed Iceland and see if the same statistic holds there.  \"So, it's true that more girls than boys get higher grades in pretty much every subject. But using this statistic to say that there is no gender difference in math skills is wrong and bad science.\" \u00a0-- Did he ever mention 'this statistic'? He was talking about certain countries where girls score just as high on some math scale (which says little about the IQ, a test of which has many scales contributing to the full score). He never talked about gender differences in Full Scale IQ scores or overall intelligence. So even if it was \"wrong and bad science\" the professor is not guilty of either.

There is a clear universal effect. Men are more prone to work alone. Men like to work with technology and women with human beings. And if you look at picture number 6 you will discover that clear gender differences have been found in the brains of the genders. Men were hunters and often time hunting alone or in small groups for many days at a time. While women were gatherers and brought along their offspring.  I don't know everything about brain scans and hormone studies. But as far as I remember women who had a bigger testosterone level as fetuses are more math prone. They are more like men in every way, and as I remember math is one of these factors. And brain scans show men to have more autistic brains. There is a better connection between the hemispheres in women. Which again makes them great at seeing the big picture with their whole brain but not as good as using one half of the brain to solve nerdy calculations. I may explain it with some wrong definitions but the point is made.  And yes. The statistics are not the only thing that proves my point and I could have said some of the other things too. But a youtube comment will always be lacking in explanation.  And the baseless assumption of yours was the assumption that there is a gender discrimination against women going on. This is just not correct. It is a hypothesis that has never been proven. But I see it again and again. Both men and women suffer in a modern society. Men live shorter lives, men have worse jobs and men die in battle. And no, there is no systematic discrimination against women in our school system. There is a \"discrimination\" both ways here in different ways. And female mathematicians at universities may have to break barriers but any university would love to have more female mathematicians. They are rare. And rare things tend to be worth more. Females bring some structure and calm being to the workplace.  Look at chimpanzees and dolphins. The females will be the ones learning the culture from their mother. While the males will play ruff tumble play and not learn as much. This is seen in most animals species. Testosterone will make you want to be more physical and less likely to like the sit still and listen part of school.

I do NOT doubt biological differences between males and females a single bit. Different genes -> different gonads -> different hormonal patterns -> different brains -> different motivation / cognition. But this is only partially true, as it's too reductionistic to explain human behaviour.  But Sapolsky never even questions the assumption of biological bases for individual differences, does he? His main point is that genes alone never determine trait variability, there are more factors involved.  There are great female mathematicians, you see. Some people may as well be interested in something \"unnatural\". If we simply said that \" A is natural for men, and B is natural for women\" because of biology we \u00a0would put constraints on people's interests and choices. People conform to social norms more than one might think (from social categorisation perspective). Some norms may be implicit but just as powerful. A woman may categorise herself as a woman, which is more than just labelling. Such cognitive categorisation ultimately shapes one's cognition. It is not a discrimination, it's our bounded rationality.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Again, the lecturer's point is that many of the claims from the field of behavioural genetics are not to be interpreted simplistically (i.e. variation in genes = variation in phenotype).

But not 100% as I already said.  \"People conform to social norms more than one might think (from social categorisation perspective).\"  - If you said this in a scientific paper it would have been thrown out. You need to do empirical experiments and not just make random statements like this. You say that genetic determinism is a dangerous point of view. But you don't see the the log in your own eye.

No one in this world says that our behavior is 100% genetic. But many people believe that genes have nothing to say.  If you think Sapolsky was right in his statement I think you need to read more about evolutionary psychology. Sapolsky definitely went into the semi-blank slate area and picked experiments proving his already concluded point of view. He made a mistake. He is still right 95% of the time, and still highly intellectual. And I like and respect him. But I refuse to ignore mistakes by him or any other scientist. I am the first to criticize Pinker and David Buss when they make mistakes. Even while other EP's call me narrow-minded when I do it. I don't care. A mistake is a mistake.  \" \"I think my main concert is that Sapolsky, Dawkins, Wilson and Sloan Wilson are doing other things than biology\" \" \u00a0- How do you define biology and how these people's studies do not fit your definition?\"  - Yes, they do a lot of evolutionary psychology too - without understand the actual subject. They sometime thing that biology can explain all behavior. They think that biology is a king discipline that stretches wider than it really does. And that EP is just a Just-so stories subject where you can make up stories while you go along. When Dawkins talks about memes and religions he clearly shows his lack of evolutionary psychology understanding. Sapolsky makes the same mistake. He does agree that we have sex differences in animals. But with humans he seem to have a political point of view, which is normal for us to have. Sloan Wilson thinks group selection is true, probably because he does not understand EP, and thinks that something like religion is so complicated that it must be group selection. Which is false. Again, I know about EP. I wont tell them how biology works because I know that they know much more about the subject than I do. But they still make bombastic statements on EP that goes against the whole scientific field of EP, disrespecting this scientific field.  If you make straw men like they do. It clearly shows that you don't understand EP in its essence. Straw mans are for people who don't want to put the work into making their conclusions. And they oftentimes take a few experiments to prove their point. That's not how EP works. Either ALL experiments prove your point or your hypothesis is narrower than you think it is.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RG5fN6KrDJE", "cid": "UgigZKan-0AHI3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-4g4o7021bCS78TN", "comment": "Well, he teaches undergrads. People need to be told that genes are not the whole story. You know it, good, but you learned it at some point, didn't you?\u00a0Statements like 50% of behaviour is genetic are absolutely meaningless if taken as what they sound like, intuitively, by laypersons.  I do not state that heritability parameters are actually different (e.g. 10% genetic), as I simply lack knowledge to claim such things. But I get were you're coming from.  Genetic variation does play a role if all else is held equal. In fact it is the only player when all else is equal. But environmental effects, if present, may dwarf a genetic predisposition. As was mentioned, having five digits is 100% genetic, yet variability is almost fully accounted for by environment. But note, I am not saying genes are not important here, which saves me from being accused of being full of B.S. (blank slate, punny isn't it?).

But I cannot leave you with thinking its a simply \"just-so\" theory. Same criticisms has been made of EP. But predictions come from justified explanations. For me to predict a system's behaviour, I must analyse it, dissect it, take it apart or break it down to basic stages. From this understanding (explanatory power) should come predictions. The theory does have predictive power, it is just seen as less than its explanatory power. It is still a work in progress, but the social-categorisation theory (part of self-identity theory) has been worked on for the past thirty years to empirically support some of the theoretical assumptions.

Chances are that most of the changes will occur in both sexes and what will determine the inclinations toward something will be an epiphenomenon of some phenotypes, like musculature for example. There are also plenty of examples of species where the females are the hunters (felines), even if they are smaller. Hence, assuming that males will be the hunters \"because they are more fit for the job\" does not imply that's what is happening or happened (which is an argument that many evolutionary psychologist will use). That's why I say there are a lot of unfounded assumptions, which are almost all logical deductions, instead of being based on evidences, which, of course, are hard to find for the reasons explained by Sapolsky. Also, almost all evolutionary hypothesis are a posteriori and most can't be falsified (always a way to reinterpret the hypothesis so it can fit the data), resulting in being weak scientific propositions.\u00a0  \u00a0Furthermore, regarding the graph you uploaded discussing the higher inclination of females to work with people, there are no error bars, and the fact that only certain countries are displayed make me suspicious.
