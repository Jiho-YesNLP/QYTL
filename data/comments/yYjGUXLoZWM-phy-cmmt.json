Teaching (and learning) is breaking the subject down into its core components, and teaching/learning these in a logical order. The worst part for me when learning something is when the teacher skips a step, which might be obvious to him/her (as he/she has had so much practice the step is automatic to them), but it isn't obvious or clear to the learner, and often I have no idea how the teacher got from a to c, because step b is missing.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
