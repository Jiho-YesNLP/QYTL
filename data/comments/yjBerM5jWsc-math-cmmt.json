Everything has to be clearly defined and understood. Outer \u201cspace\u201d is not to be referred to as SPACE. Gravity, as it has been written, is an interaction. It is fundamental. The term inertia is now redefined as \u201cinertia/inertial resistance\u201d. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Einstein never nearly understood physics/physical experience. Here are the facts.  PRECISELY WHY AND HOW THE BALANCED, TOP DOWN, COMMON SENSE, SIMPLE, EXTENSIVE, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS PROVEN BY (AND CONSISTENT WITH) F=MA AND E=MC2:  The following also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution.  c squared represents a dimension of SPACE on balance WITH the fact that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Indeed, the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE (on balance) !! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c) (ON BALANCE); AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND necessarily) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).  General Relativity is directly taken from Special Relativity. E=mc2 is taken directly from F=ma. CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. I have exposed Einstein. Beautiful.  Note: Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Think carefully about the black \u201cspace\u201d AS WELL. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. THE EYE represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) that is consistent with F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE. Consider what is necessarily, CLEARLY, logically, and by definition the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!! Think about what is true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY !!! Great.  Consider what is THE SUN. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.  The gravitational \u201cfield\u201d is E=mc2 as F=ma. Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) on balance. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. I have explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Carefully consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Consider what is the balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. E=mc2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. That's the answer. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).  Get a good LOOK at what are the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon AND the orange AND setting Sun. Consider what is the blue sky ON BALANCE. Lava is orange, and it is even blood red. THINK !!! SO, ON BALANCE, consider what are the tides !!! Excellent. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Accordingly, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense; as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. Think about what is the BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE, AND consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE !!! Wonderful. The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. The tides are CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be ELECTROMAGNETIC/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE, as E=mc2 IS F=ma (ON/IN BALANCE).

It didn't jump out at me why all possible combinations of two vectors couldn't fill R3.  But I know the column space of two vectors is a plane in 3D space.  So no matter what combination, I can't get off the plane.  I know any two vectors in R3 are on a plane because I can take the cross product of the two vectors, both vectors will be perpendicular to the cross product, and the cross product is the normal vector to the plane containing the two vectors.  From there, I think of it like street corners.  Go straight two blocks, turn left and go four blocks.  Or go 25 blocks, turn left and go 40 blocks.  Whatever the combination, I'm still just turning a corner on a flat surface. I can scale (1,1,2) however many times, but when I turn to (2,2,5), I'm just changing direction in a plane.  (Actually Prof Strang corrects in the next lecture that matrix with columns (1,1,2), (2,2,5) & (3,3,8) is not invertible because it has duplicate rows.)  But a 3x3 matrix with independent columns (1,1,2), (2,2,5) & (3,2,8) spans R3 because elimination works on the matrix -- I don't get zeros in any pivot position.  So no matter what point in R3 I pick, back subsitution is just arithmetic, it works for any point in R3 and therefore spans R3.     But how can I do elimination in R3 with ony two columns?  How would back substitution work?  If I go through the elimination and look at matrix U, it\u2019s clear that there are limits on what matrix B could be solvable.  All of R3 is not solvable, so a 3x2 matrix cannot span R3.  When I do elimination on (1,1,2), (2,2,5) I end up with all zeros in row m and zero in the final pivot position m-n.  Therefore the only R3 vectors that work for back substitution is {x,y,0}.  (The equation for Row m in the augmented matrix U is 0x + 0y  = 0).  {x,y,0} describes the x-y plane in R3, where z always equals zero.  That\u2019s the column space for the matrix.  There is no solution for any 3*2 matrix for any vector off the x-y plane.  For the same reason, this will be true for any m*n matrix where m > n \u2014 Elimination can\u2019t work for all vectors in Rn because you get hung up in row m.

It has started with a simple matrix and look it is creating the whole universe, explaining the existence. That's the beauty of it!!! It feels amazing when I spend my time with the abstract world. My intuition says \"There is something still hiding and right now you are in the dark place so either you can't get out from that place or you can't stand still\".   Let's look at these beautiful connections:  A matrix has some columns and these are called vectors. The vectors are independent if their combinations give no zero except if they are zero vectors {How???) and dependent if the opposite of the statement is true.  What is the connection between independence and null space and the rank of a matrix? the vector are Independent when the Null space of that matrix = zero vector and the rank is no of columns (Think !!!) =Invertible = nonsingular matrix. For dependence of vectors there exists at least one free variable ( Do you know what is free variable?) and rank is less than the number of columns. ( Singular???)  The linear combination of the whole vectors forms space. (Here your existence, experience, can be explained!!! Can you visualize it in your imagination? )  The basis for a vector space is the sequence of all the vectors with two properties 1) They are independent ( look independence again comes here!!!) 2)They span a space ( what is span??? Think!!!) ( What space can be formed from these vectors (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,1,1)? )  The basis!!!  The children of a space! In a three dimensional space with any two vectors, what is the basis for that space? (Is it  a plane or a space or a line???)  Every basis for a vector space has the same number of vectors given space and that's called the dimension of the space. The number of vectors is very important.(why??? Think!!!)  The Dimension of a column and a null space???  The dimension of the column space=The rank of matrix =Number of pivot columns. Remember, it does not depend directly on the dimension of the matrix.   The dimension of the null space = number of columns - rank of the matrix = The number of free variables. The basis of the column space is generated from the all the linearly independent vectors of a matrix given a space. If We know the dimension of the space then a couple of vectors that are independent be a basis.

That's exactly what professor Strang always does, and that's one of the reasons why he is so amazing.  I also think that it is very important that a lecturer shows a genuine fascination for the subject, and is always willing to help the students and respects that some of them may have a harder time than others with certain parts; and it is also a huge plus if the lecturer has a sense of humour and presents the lecturers in a relaxed way.

If the plane doesn't contain the zero vector, we can't possibly define a basis for it since the vectors contained in the plane aren't spanning anything. One condition for a basis is that it must span the space we're interested in. The span of a set of vectors, by definition, is all possible linear combinations of those vectors, INCLUDING zero multiples of all of them. So, if the zero vector is not included, the vectors don't span a space, and so the concept of a basis is totally useless. What we CAN do is to find a basis for a plane PARALLEL to the plane in question that DOES pass through the origin and then take the sum of any of its linear combinations with any single vector on the plane in question. That would be the only way to define a plane that does not pass through the origin in terms of a subspace basis.
