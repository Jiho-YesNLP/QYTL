Quick question if d=1/N , N = number of lines per meter ,for example, d= slit spacing\u2026 then are we counting the end edge of the diffraction grating as 1slit? Take a diffraction grating of 1m with one line ( slit) in the middle, we know slit spacing is 0.5 m \u2026 we know there are 2 slit spacings & 1 slit. But applying the formula without counting end edge as 1 slit we get o.5 = 1/1 \u2026 instead of 0.5=1/2 ( counting the end edge as a slit. ) I hope this makes sense.. thanks \ud83d\ude4f", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gf7j2fumz70", "cid": "Ugx_XLUdOXp5_6otYKV4AaABAg", "comment": "Pls I think there\u2019s a mistake with the conversion from centimeter to meter cos while solving am getting a different answer from yours.", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gf7j2fumz70", "cid": "UgxoQucNZbZyzlBEqg54AaABAg.9crcRwSaI-l9vI7PHjh_Fy", "comment": "nah slits is just the difference between the gap and the other border its the same thing", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "gf7j2fumz70", "cid": "UgyYQgv2F9h5CCEBHTZ4AaABAg.9aASsH-PIjD9bohDtqQIFl", "comment": "By my understanding, M1 and m2 are maximas", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "gf7j2fumz70", "cid": "Ugx_XLUdOXp5_6otYKV4AaABAg.9QnX1KyO88b9QtUFgd9K0d", "comment": "im getting 100 he made a mistake", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "gf7j2fumz70", "cid": "UgyKl0Rs2ckOexFnRTd4AaABAg", "comment": "This is exactly the video I was searching for Thanks bro", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gf7j2fumz70", "cid": "UgwLp_YKwkTqcJD0Wrp4AaABAg", "comment": "Guys most of us owe our lives to this dude, you're a gem man.
