But...  Big-O, and little snippets of code are fine, but don't you guys ever work with real software? Million-liners? The kind that can get orders of magnitude speed improvement, not by messing with searching/sorting algorithms, but by finding out what it's doing that doesn't NEED to be done?  Suppose you have some monster code that takes 100 seconds to run. Suppose it has routine A calling B in a jillion places, and in 60 of those seconds A is calling B for a lousy reason.** If you knew that you could fix it and get it down to 40 seconds, for a 2.5 times speedup. Wouldn't you want to fix it? Then suppose routine C calls D for a lousy reason for 30 of those seconds. After you fix the A-B problem, the C-D problem still takes 30 seconds, but now it's 30 seconds out of 40, not 100. So maybe before it wasn't so much worth fixing, but now it really is! If you fix it you go down to 10 seconds. That's a 10-times speedup. Then what about E-F, which was 8 seconds, and so on? That's how you get orders of magnitude constant factors.  I bet you doubt that real software has such problems. That doubt means they are not looked for, and that's why they are not found.  Do this. Run the program, in a debug build so it has symbols, under any debugger like GDB. Start it, and stop it at random by hitting Ctrl-C. Then do BT to see the stack trace. Do this several times. Chances are very good that you will see the A-B problem on multiple stack traces. Profiler programs will not see it for a whole variety of reasons I could go into. And notice - you found the problem without measuring. You don't know how big it is; all you know is that it's big. Its bigness is what made it visible! If you're really into \"measure, measure\", just take more samples. I never take more than 20, usually 10 or less. The bigger the problem is, the sooner you see it.  Then maybe you guys will see beyond big-O.  ** Typical speed bugs: - Calling new or delete when a prior object could just be re-used. - Calling pushback which deletes, reallocates, and copies an array just to make it 1 element bigger. - I/O time formatting or writing lines to a log file that nobody reads. - I/O time reading a DLL file to get a string translation resource, when the string doesn't need to be translated. - Calling an array-indexing function to index an array, to make sure the index is within range, when you know the index cannot be out of range. - Calling == between strings to check program state, when integers could be used. ... there is no limit to the ways time can be wasted.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "o9nW0uBqvEo", "cid": "Ugwvjg1f-irOeSH_b5p4AaABAg", "comment": "Summary of 50mins:  Always use worst case scenario to indicate the time taken by an algorithm.

For example, if it takes 3n\u00b2 + n + 1000000, then the worst case scenario is still O(n\u00b2) because you don't care about the constant (1000000), the terms with lower degree of polynomial (n) and the coefficient of the highest degree of polynomial (3).  Let's say we have 2 lists, L1 and L2 with the same numbers in them. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...,n], and we try to compare them. Let's say in the first loop we do one operation, and in the nested loop we do 3 operations. The first time you compare 1 in L1 to 1 in L2, it will do 3 operation since you do 3 in the nested loop. Since the comparation is True, you continue on with the first loop. The second time you compare 2 in L1 and 1 in L2, you also do 3 in the nested loop. But since the comparation is False, you continue on with the nested loop. Now you compare the number 2 in L1 and 2 in L2, and you also do 3. In total, you do 3 + 3 = 6 operations in the second loops. The 3rd loop you will do 3 + 3 + 3, and so on.
