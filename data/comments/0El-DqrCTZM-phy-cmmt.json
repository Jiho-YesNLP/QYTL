I solved for time using one of the kinematic equations, and since we can treat Delta time as strictly the final time (since we can treat our initial time as zero), you're able to solve for time, then continue on with the only other kinematic equation that has theta as a variable (the one he didn't use since he didn't solve for time) and solve for theta that way. My answer was the same as his, however if you aren't careful with plugging your time into the theta equation as it was 1.3 repeating, (I just input roughly 1.3333333 ) for my time to get it as accurate as possible, your final answer can be changed slightly. If you enter time strictly as 1.3, your answer will be off by about .4.
