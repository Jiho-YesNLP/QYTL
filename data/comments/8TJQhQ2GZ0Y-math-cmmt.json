But I think this is designed more for money management taking someone's money and diversifying it putting in different places. I find it confusing.  I worked in portfolio management and saw a portfolio isn't necessarily diversified it's a certain sector it might be large Capital companies in the US and you need to have at least a hundred of them in your portfolio and you select them by the analysts doing research on companies to determine who's going to be doing well in the future have growth increase the stock prices. You have to show the reasons you're buying each and every company according to SEC rules and you have to keep that in the database for it to be reviewed. So that's kind of how you select stocks for a fun you do research you look at the financials you try to talk to people within the company determining with their near future is going to be like will it be growing.  So he's not really teaching about the different sectors here like I think he needs to you need to know what kind of areas you can put money into and what types of economies are good for different areas so I guess economics has an awful lot to do with managing money managing funds. The idea that you can use formulas and plug everything in and get all your answers well then anyone could manage a fondant anyone could manage money but determining like what sect is it going to do well in certain economies is really what determines where you put your money. There are no magic formulas. I guess the proof is this guy's lecturing he's not running a big fund somewhere because if he could you make an awful lot of money managing big funds. I haven't watched all the lecture but I will when I get a chance but right now this kind of scares me because somebody thinks they're taking this class I don't know what they think they're going to get out of it how to manage their money how to create a fund it's confusing to me. Maybe he doesn't have an economics degree but he's got to think like an economist he's got to think like how is the economy in the US how's the economy in Mexico how's the economy in Spain to kind of determine where you put in your money and what sect is it good you know large companies small companies medium size companies minerals bonds there's an awful lot to it I'm not sure you take this class and you know how to do anything.

If we have a long time horizon and do not react emotionally to crashes, pandemics and the like, the concept of probability will reward us. First it will reward us on a somewhat gradual basis as the years go by and then often on an exponential basis as the investments we made initially (and reinvested dividends) really gain traction.

Happens all the time\u2026 often enough for me to make a great living lol (I trade ES futures).   Writing this on November 23rd, 2023, after the S&P posted one of the craziest rallies ever recorded.
