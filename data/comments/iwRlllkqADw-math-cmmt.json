For the ellipse with center (0, 0), foci at (-2, 0) and (2, 0), and vertices at (-4, 0) and (4, 0)  First, let's find the distance between the foci. The distance between the foci is given by the formula:  c = distance between foci = 2a  Since the foci are located at (-2, 0) and (2, 0), we can see that the distance between them is 4 units. Therefore, c = 4.  Next, let's find the value of a, which represents half the length of the major axis. The distance between the center (0, 0) and each vertex (-4, 0) or (4, 0) is equal to a.  So, a = 4.  Now, we can use the values of a and c to determine the equation of the ellipse. The general equation for an ellipse with its center at (0, 0) is:  (x^2 / a^2) + (y^2 / b^2) = 1  Since the center is (0, 0), the equation becomes:  (x^2 / 4^2) + (y^2 / b^2) = 1  Simplifying further, we have:  (x^2 / 16) + (y^2 / b^2) = 1  To find the value of b, we can use the relationship between a, b, and c:  c^2 = a^2 - b^2  Substituting the known values, we get:  4^2 = 4^2 - b^2  16 = 16 - b^2  b^2 = 0  This tells us that b = 0. However, an ellipse cannot have a major axis of length 8 (2a) and a minor axis of length 0. Thus, there seems to be an error in the given information.

In this case, the center is given as $(-2,4)$, so $h=-2$ and $k=4$. Additionally, we know the foci and vertices, which provide key information about the dimensions of the ellipse:  - The distance between the center and each focus is $c$, so $c = 5 - 4 = 1$. - The distance between the center and each vertex along the major axis is $a$, so $a = 9 - 4 = 5$. - The distance between the center and each co-vertex along the minor axis is $b$, so $b = 1$.
