The gratitude that was thrown up here seems to be relating to the professor's teaching style, nothing more. There is no foundation for my opinion to matter here, for far too many reasons. Not only am I not a college graduate, but just don't feel qualified to say. What impressed me was that such prestigious schools post up courses such as these, for us, free of charge to learn from. What it appears that was being expressed here, months ago, was simple gratitude for the opportunity to be a part of this class.  Perhaps then, selfishly, we can see me stoked on understanding some of the content. Thanks to the way the information was being presented.   It could be dishonest of me to say the content doesn't interest me.  It's very rare to see, if at all, me comment or post on any platforms. It's foolish. Perhaps due to changes in the ways of seeing. Today, engaging in the act of living and being present in the feelings have become more important today.. Plus,  There are probably dozens of thoughts that pass through on the daily where the following week, one can notice himself with a whole different outlook or take on things. What I do love is learning.   This class must have caught me of gaurd as did the reply, in this early A.M. as one, lol, babbles on. (Ah geeze...) Education is essential for growth... We are lucky and blessed to have opportunities, for free, are we not?  Can't learning be engaging and enjoyable. See, the comment above says simply,  \"enjoy the debt lol...\" Literally, if I am being perfectly honest,... -no clue \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  ...seriously at a loss, as to what that even means,...  The \"private-hilarity...\" of this world's \"comment-section-spaces...\" is beyond me, so much metaphorical-candor usually, strange or off-beat comical, I guess I just don't get it. \ud83e\udd14   Thank you again, as one notices himself laugh'n at his own foolishness.  Still, education is important. Is it not? Can't it be fun, engaging, adaptable... all students are not built the same... See...  [Yesterday A.M. was brilliant, beautiful, difficult and so worth it. The simple feeling of sharing coffee with a special someone. That class session left me speechless and peaceful, with the lessons still synching in... Again, that is a \"brilliant professor,\"  If some of us \"slow-learner's\" were less chatty and more... \ud83e\udd14[...ahh geeze... lost ma train of \ud83d\ude06] ....dang it:) ...perhaps the world just needs more engaging professors?  ..or maybe a smoother curriculum for specific students, especially grad students\u00bf And again, yesterday mornings engineering course was worth more than all the words and lessons in all the classrooms in all the world\ud83c\udf0e. Slow-learners can be in fact to smart for their own good. As cliche as that statement is. How can we help them? Lecture after lecture especially opinion based format can suck. Kids in the back can have hearing problems, ...schools with budget cuts won't allow headsets for all the students. It's as if the system doesn't even understand it can lose even more money when a student has to retake a course because of hearing issues, misunderstandings or no tuduring options...? How can we engage more, feel more... fun, be an inspiration more... to be able to feel engaged in a debate-able conversation about education can be enjoyable. Maybe not as enjoyable as a classroom that offers coffee sessions and snacks. Yet, and agian, being as humble as one can here, if we are that unwilling to see students as individuals, therefore NOT involving them in their own learning... What if we are missing out on some future leaders, future teachers... The same dull lectures, barely audible, for some kids... class after class,.. How can the information absorb? It's not for me to say. This was DEFINITELY NOT the case here nor was it personally, yesterday A.M.,  See, the engineering class had an incredible instructor, with only a few dull, irrelevant, \"comment-section-snark,\" the whole class. There were more than one of us who could see some of the students ears shut-off for those fee moments. Then turn on again instant once it stopped. Totally worth it... It's a shame that some kids still need a course on being able to speak and understand in their own tounge, or rather the language of the collegiate. But is it not more of a shame that their are NO courses, no-one willing to teach this?  Looking back at one's own or even another's comment's can be misunderstood and even, often harsh.   What I think the comment from @anthonyourbrother was expressing was simply, gratitude for understanding more in this class and more EVERY session... with the professor serving coffee cake \u2615\ufe0f  If it were possible, I'd love to take any course that professor dishes out. Professor's like her can set up a student for success for the whole day... then, even the maditory lecture noise can maybe absorb better... \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f\u2695\ufe0f  The thing is,..  Humbly drawing only from personal experience. So please take these words as simple (opinion-based-nonsense ma-friend, above all else...)   non certainly, there is a lesson, one could say (masterclass lesson) whether it be..., \"physical - chemistry (\"physio\")or psychologically based\" where-in a person is in the dee p  process of...  learning,... after passing the pre-requisite courses,  the \"private study,\" where a Personal-Tudor or sponsorship IS mandatory programming/ \"de-programming,\" [social-structurally sensitive learning...] Leadership/Grad-School- [(important stuff)] Involving \"one-on-one\" based learning in the home involves deception-based equations, solutions and services for student based specifics, personal to that students needs. What if we could fast-track this ever evolving format a lil smoother? What if more classrooms could get their students charged-up for learning? They don't ALL.. have to offer snacks, do they? That may be too costly...\u00bf but then, what reasons would there be to say it's too costly? And again, WHO is saying this? And where is this funding going....?  But one could argue that the school' community-based comment section itself in all it's clever-metaphorical humor... and gosh, the effort it must take to craft-dis-assemble, funding and programming that's hurtful to children.  Rather than be inspirational, allowing valued students, honor-students to achieve success, keep the senses focused for wherever the day takes them. Again, not for me to say. But this man's as well as the engineering teachers approach, not perfect man, but who the hell is? At least they engage with  their students one on one, repeating things to help the info download. These are teachers that care. They make a difference. I'm grateful for them, and perhaps ignorant forever to comments devoid of gratitude or.... \u00bf To all those out there who believe in a better way. Let's help each other, feel-good,...  about change, forgive, accept, open-up, encourage, innovate. Those who want to continue to vomit cost issues. We can restructure. The simplest thing's can lead to great solutions. When we shoot our mouths off the make sure we know where we are aiming and help others when they don't.

That is one of the major weaknesses of the camera work and still a constant complaint. The operator is always focusing on following our Incredibly Learned Professor's beard, while we're focusing on following his words that describe what he is demonstrating on his diagram. So that our minds are trying to imagine the diagram, WHICH IS NOT SHOWN BY THE CAMERA. We are lucky whenever the camera manages to follow at least our Incredibly Learned Professor's arm, if not the drawing. It depends on which side of the wall the diagram is posted on the blackboard.  For instance, when the diagram is on the board to the left of the wall, then our Incredibly Learned Professor faces towards the left with his left shoulder to the audience while being positioned near the right edge of the screen. This is the best for us video viewers,  we get the professor, his hand and the diagram all together in the image.  However, if the drawing is on the right side of the wall, then the reverse happens. Our Incredibly Learned Professor faces towards the right, with his right shoulder towards the audience, and the hand disappears towards the right, beyond the  right edge of the screen where the drawing remains hidden.  The worst happens when the drawing is on a board that remains up there, above our Incredibly Learned Professor's  head, while he is tilting his head upwards towards the diagram without bringing down the board with the diagram to place it inside the camera's angle. That terribly annoying habit of the camera focusing on the beard rather than on the diagram where the demonstration is being played out, has been going on ever since the very first lectures.  With the very worst when the assistants took over for a couple of lectures. Then the diagrams remained out of view most of the time. So frustrating! So amateurish! I find it utterly amazing that the camera operator is not realizing that he is filming a whole oral discussion, with the speaker always shown, but about a diagram or picture THAT IS NOT SHOWN ON THE SCREEN. Go and figure!  This is probably due to the fact that the camera is positioned to the right side of the room, taking in the back wall more easily when the action moves towards the left of the back wall, but remains constrained when the action moves back towards the right end of the back wall.

This means that you have the knowledge of what the original rules were so that you can do this tracing.  However, the laws of physics, even a \"Theory of Everything\" does not have consciousness as a possible output -- there is no way to go forward or backward between that Theory and consciousness.  Thus, we need a different Theory that contains some \"place\" that has \"dimensions\" (parameters) that can form consciousness.  In other words, we have a universe that has \"directions\" that are not physical -- meters or seconds or degrees -- to describe it that we can form \"formulae\" to describe the \"motion\" (change in state) of the things that are described by this \"place\".  We thus have to  find out what dimensions can be created to describe the various actual parts that can add up to consciousness.  Until we find the dimensions/rules to allow the formation of conscious patterns -- what is ands is not conscious -- we will not be able to handle this kind of existing structure.  Patterns, patterns, patterns.  These have totally different kinds and ranges of \"spaces\" and rules -- dimensions and laws about them -- that are superimposed on the regular laws of physics and the dimensions covered by its rules.  The two kind of things are interlocked (you only have the matter and energy of the laws of physics to work with), but the patterns layered on top of these have a \"life\" of its own, giving independent results.

Dutton & Sons, 1956; reprint, Sussex, England: J. M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., 1967), p. 10.  10 Laws of Nature Regarding Information, which prove evolution false and prove creation is true:  1. Anything material, such as physical/chemical processes, cannot create something non-material 2. Information is a non-material fundamental entity and not a property of matter 3. Information requires a material medium for storage and transmission 4. Information cannot arise from statistical processes 5. There can be no information without a code -- no thought or idea can be shared without a code 6. All codes result from an intentional choice and agreement between sender and recipient 7. The determination of meaning for and from a set of symbols is a mental process that requires intelligence 8. There can be no new information without an intelligent, purposeful sender 9.  Any given chain of information can be traced back to an intelligent source 10. Information comprises the non-material foundation for all:     a. technological systems     b. works of art     c. biological systems  Therefore: 1. Since the DNA code of all life is clearly within the definition domain of information, we conclude that there must be a sender 2. Since the density and complexity of the DNA encoded information is billions of times greater than man's present technology, we conclude that the sender must be supremely intelligent 3. Since the sender must have     a. encoded (stored) the information into the DNA molecules,     b. constructed the molecular biomachines required for the encoding, decoding, and synthesizing process and,     c. designed all the features for the original life forms,  We conclude the sender must be purposeful and supremely powerful. 4. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, we conclude that the sender must have a non-material component 5. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, and since information also originates from man, we conclude man's nature must have a non-material component (spirit) 6. Since information is a non-material entity, we conclude that the assumption \"the universe is comprised solely of mass and energy\" is false. 7. Since:     1) biological information originates only from an intelligent sender and,     2) all theories of chemical and biological evolution require that information must originate solely from mass and energy alone (without a sender), we conclude that all theories or concepts of biological evolution are false.  Anyone who disagrees with these laws and conclusions must falsify them by demonstrating the initial origin of information from purely material sources. Therefore, the laws of nature about information have:  1. refuted the assumption of scientific materialism and the theories of chemical and biological evolution  2. all philosophies or theories based on the assumption of scientific materialism including chemical and biological evolution are falsified by the laws of nature about information.

Sapolsky is talking about the emergence and how it is all very good and leads to velvet revolutions.

In a Jaron Lanier lecture, he explains the downsides of this bottom up emergence via social media: you click on what is upsetting you the most instead of what is more interesting in the long run. So our brain is wired to click on ''wtf'' headlines and this is making us click down the internet rabbit hole down the drain. And this is how flat earthers and conspiracy theories are gaining traction. So we still need a framework: that is solid and builds trust. And algorithms that are going up instead of downwards based on every time slightly angrier or further down the rabbit hole because fast clicks make more advertising money. And slow background stories are not. So we need to intervene in our algorithms: more gradience in attraction-repulsion of our cookies. If it is not a stable system, society falls apart and then we have no emergence anymore.

But only if the ants are stupid enough : )  Several years ago I simulated an ant colony in C# using virtual pheromones.  Ants have a home/energy scent which they carry with them but which decreases over time.  When low enough they turn around and follow it home to replentish.  This stopped them getting lost on random wanders.  When they found food they got a satisfaction scent which also decreases over time.  They trail this back to the nest.  New ants coming out use that for guidance and therefore tend to follow a similar path.  This reinforces the satisfaction paths and results in chains of ants attacking a food resource.  Where satisfying paths cross ants discover more efficient paths.  As food is taken it's value decreases... at 0 the food is gone.  The more satisfied ants that arrive at the colony, the more ants are created/dispatched.  Thus colonies search using relatively little aggregate energy and then harvest using high aggregate energy,  When an ant follows the expectation of a satisfaction scent and it goes cold (food depleted or moved), it extends by random wander till it is low on energy and then follows the home scent gradient back (Sometimes wandering across stronger more efficient paths )  This allows the efficient exhaustion of localised clusters of food and food that is 'moved' (being their God, I sometimes mess with them)  On not finding food a 'disappointment' scent is dropped.  This decreases the likelihood of further ants being dispatched to a depleted food source.  It also assists ants doing random wanders and allows the colonies to cover more new ground efficiently.  In a supply chain of ants, any returning 'dissappointed' ants will cause some outbound ants to turn around and the supply lines collapse in an fairly orderly manner.  There are still enough ants at the depleted site to random-wander the wider area where the food source was before returning.  Slowly the satisfaction trail turns into a disappointment trail and the scent fades.  I have yet to find any system that only relies on the conditions of the square you occupy, that can find and harvest food faster and more efficiently... and it only relies on a +/- satisfaction scent and tiredness.  Without these, ants leave the colony, wander aimlessly and perish till the colony is empty.   I later went on to simulate multiple competing colonies using a fear/aggression scent.  Colonies now go nuts when their supply lines are attacked.  This allows me to determine the fittest ant code ... so I have a plan to extend this to having 3 axes of scent and a small neural network which can learn to use those scents arbitrarily to establish some organised behaviour.  Genetics will be used to incrementally improve ant efficiency in a competitive environment.  I'm hoping that this will result in a couple of different species of super-ants which can defeat my original programmatic ants and contend with each other.  There is no telling just what tweaks the NN and genetic algorithm will make to how these superants will employ scents to govern behaviour.  I'm hoping that over time some indication of 'food size' or 'threat size' will emerge - as the NN will have all those local values available.  Efficiency will be important as every ant colony is a store of energy, and every ant departing or arriving will borrow or contribute to this energy... so the efficient management of resources is a survival trait.  To assist colonies in developing very different behaviours, I'm planning a number of genetic freedoms.  For example... strength/speed/carrying ability ... this should result in fast weak ants relying on range, speed and avoidance ... and perhaps a stronger more expensive type of ant which favours agression over harvesting... maybe even a colony buster which learns to ignore food and prioritise stealing from colonies.  As all scents can evolve, some colonies may even learn to mimic others to get an advantage.   Oh, in the code I hold 256x256 bitmaps where the R, G, B and A planes hold food and scents.  This makes it easy to manage the laying and reading of scents.  The world is actually 4096x4096 and so the scent-maps are 'fuzzy' ... I can display any plane as a monochrome bitmap to see what's going on in the scentiverse and what my ants are reacting to.  It's pretty cool and fun to watch/feed my ants.  I feed them with a 'food paintbrush' and impede them with an 'obstacle paintbrush' ; )  I recommend it to anyone with a little coding experience to have a go at animating their own ants - even just with hardcoded rules : )", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "o_ZuWbX-CyE", "cid": "UgwQ4rInYGGbcnpM_ZV4AaABAg", "comment": "mr Sapolsky... you're killing me", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "o_ZuWbX-CyE", "cid": "Ugyi5AeYG-V6zswdJ1l4AaABAg.91b5BvtgoP7949kXMy4162", "comment": "Jared Prince  \ud83d\udc51 The Pursuit of Power EUROPE 1815-1914By RICHARD J.

Revised TOE: 3/25/2017a.\r My Current TOE:\r \r THE SETUP:\r 1. Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.\r 2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it's the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too.  It occurs at the outer end of the inner arc of the horseshoe magnet.).\r 3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.\r 4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.\r 5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.\r \r FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:\r 6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.\r 7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron's moving magnetic field.\r 8. There are probably no such thing as \"gluons\" in actual reality.\r 9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.\r 10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.\r 11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.\r 12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.\r \r THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:\r 13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is \"gravity\".  It's the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon and acts 90 degrees to the EM forces which act 90 degrees to each other.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, \"gravity\" flips and EM goes to minimum, then \"gravity\" flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it's maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.\r 14. I also believe that a pulsating, swirling singularity (which is basically a pulsating, swirling 'gem' photon) is the energy unit in this universe.\r 15. When these pulsating, swirling energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together and can interlock at times. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.\r 16. When the energy units unite and interlock together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.\r 17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.\r 18. Everything is basically \"light\" (photons) in a universe entirely filled with \"light\" (photons).\r \r THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:\r 19. When the electron with it's associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it's associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.\r 20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.\r 21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.\r \r NOTES:\r 22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it's magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center's black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.\r 24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.\r 25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven't evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven't evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren't acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.\r 26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?\r \r DISCLAIMER:\r 27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.\r  ________________________________________________________________________________________________  Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.\r \r a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.\r b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.\r c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.\r (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)\r d. Shoot a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.\r e. Do this with the em fields on and off.\r (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results.)\r f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.\r (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)\r \r (An alternative to the above would be to shoot 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)\r \r 'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done.\r 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.

The problem with suggesting that behaviour emergent from details can be, or will be, structurally formative is always the same, no matter what abstraction level you're on. Ants will not create cute sandcastle-windows in their ant-hills from chaotic individual behaviour, no more than that the behaviour itself is ever going to have an actual will. It will also have to obey the framework the individuals are operating on: ants won't become, via emergent behaviour at least, conscious artists - even if they created patterns that can be very pleasing to other species.  In the same way, the idea that officers and soliders with instant communication devices would have stopped ww1 is ludicrous - there's a reason why they were in the trenches in the first place. And just like the ants are crawling around their trails, it's unlikely that the soliders would be able to defy the context they would be placed in. Instead what would have happened is that they would all be shot for desertion - or likely blackmailed in the press via leaks, and sentenced to jail or forced to flee the country.  Or, the ants would be able to create optimal pathways (in an extremely inefficient way by lots and lots of trial and error - and then new trial and error every time there's a rainfall or a landslide, or even just a deep foot depression in the trail). While the officers in the trenches would be able to optimize their survivability within the constraints of their situation. But if they tried to simply defy orders, or just go home, and this would be known and widely spread, they'd be toast.  So while I'm sure that the only possible revolution in the \"west\" right now would be by means of sitting in your couch and clicking on sales-items on amazon - the idea that there'd be structural change emerging by means of hive-mind solutions is just as ludicrous as the idea that ants will, by no individual intelligence, eventually design ant-hills with disney-towers. Or, that 100.000 monkeys with keyboards will inadvertently produce Locke's treatises of Civil Government and cause a milling around that manifests in sound political reforms and intelligent discussion.  It's not going to happen. Emergent properties are optimal solutions in a specifically defined structural framework. So no matter how astonishing that solution might be to an individual, it cannot defy the limitations of the framework at this abstraction level.  Meaning that while you can't trace an intelligent human chain of reasoning back to genetic components or specific chemical reactions - you can observe the means by which the brain constructs it. Which still would be, in that same incredibly inefficient way, the optimal solution to that as well. But emergent behaviour won't result in intelligent thought; it would not be that, by definition. It would be emergent behaviour from simple low-level rules.   And it's honestly kind of frightening that a neurologist(?) is sort of implying that human thought is popping up by necessity as a result of a bunch of neurons being produced. Unless he's making a joke that goes straight over the heads of the entire class, about how none of them are ever going to be able to really produce anything original and considered, because \"thinking about this is very hard\".   But remember that even if emergent behaviour can be indistinguishable from learned instruction or careful reasoning and discussion (certainly nowadays) - it's not intelligent decision-making, by definition. It's fulfilling a solution that, if it exists at all, must be in this specific way. I.e., the construction of the brain, the vascular system, the republican party, and ants down a hill.

We might have an abstract idea that is expressed in language, but nobody's managing a printing press in there.  Or what is happening when we're reaching for a solution to a problem that seems just out of reach, frustratingly elusive; and then it pops into our head the next day at the supermarket, when we're looking at the cheese counter.  Something has been going on that we're not aware of, or have only an incohate feeling or intuition, and then pop! A fully formed 'thought' is presented to us by our own mind.  What was happening behind the scenes.  If we accept that we last had a common ancestor with the chimpanzees and the baboons about 4 mya, and in the time since, our 'intelligence' has far outstripped our cousins, how has that happened.  Chimps have thoughts, they learn patterns and process information that enables them to make decisions in novel situations.  And so do we, except at a more sophisticated level.  Was the increase in capability a sudden step into human intelligence and consciousness, or was it emergent over time?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "o_ZuWbX-CyE", "cid": "UgzVkV_1p1xtG55W4rN4AaABAg.8lL8YzzH9WL9k6su5nRiGl", "comment": "\u00a0@Ozymandi_as\u00a0 It could be emergent from the system, obviously. But I'm insisting that there is no such thing as a way to turn individually random or chaotic details into intelligent thought, given that there is enough of it.  The difference here is between accepting that a chimpanzee and a human brain have basically the same functionality - except that we have more of it, and probably more plasticity in how certain pathways are formed(this can be explained evolutionary, and we end up with us as being story-telling, particularly clever monkeys with good memories. And where long, intricate memories are probably essential to the whole thing being different from chimps).   And between saying that neurons individually, and even in large quantities (which certain animals have) don't have much purpose of any kind, really, outside instinct or something, like a machine, perhaps, with some set functions with enzymes and hormones and things. And then saying that there is a mysterious process that happens on a treshold-value that transforms you from \"inanimate object/animal\" into \"human\". That's not how this works. And claiming this would be the same as saying that ants, if sufficiently well-designed individually, are going to develop something indistinguishable from human intelligence if there was a sufficiently large number of them working together. They go from instincts and physically determined intelligent behaviour - and then into enlightenment by sheer mass.  That's not why or how thought exists. We do make an absurd amount of very strange things make sense in our brains, that's true. We have a myriad of thoughts, and like you point out, unconscious thought. That we then translate into something we, perhaps, imagine all of a sudden we have always known. But that we can't really point out why we do. We have weaknesses in the system, and we're sometimes acutely aware of it - we can sense that we have known a certain thing very clearly sometimes, and then we - in very bright moments - become aware of that we have forgotten it. We remember the feeling and that we have known it, but we don't remember what it is.   But this is not proof that not enough neurons were mysteriously working in the background to maintain the ant-brain. It's becoming aware of how flimsy what we truly know is, to the point where forming really clever thought can be quickly wasted - if we didn't have really, really good memories -- at least compared to other beings on the planet.  An example: the most clever birds will have memories of where they've been, and even recognize people. I have a magpie that keeps coming back to my house, even though we stopped feeding them over a year ago. It comes back and waits for us, and then has a reaction of some sort when it sees us. I don't think it knows why, or can reflect on it. But that there is a memory and a reaction that isn't just mechanically triggered by a section in the brain delegated to \"emotion\", that I'm completely certain of.  People act in the same way. And if we couldn't speak, but just squawked a lot instead(completely impossible to imagine..), I'm sure we would have a very hard time convincing anyone else, human or not, that there was a difference between instinctive bonds and evolutionary psychological traits - and what we would like to do and what we are interested in, what we want, etc.  Nevertheless, intelligent thought is not built on individual mechanical functions of neurons being triggered by mechanical causes. If so, we would know, for a fact, what we were going to think, what we would do, and what we are going to attempt. And at least, even with very crude measurement systems (or just writing down what we think), we would be able to predict very easily how people would think to answer certain questions, how they would go about reflecting on certain things, how they would solve simple problems, etc.   But we can't do that. In fact, we can't do that with pretty stupid animals, either (outside very specific tests, where humans would be equally predictable).   So the thought here is that yes, it's the same physical type of neurons, that perform the same type of task. But thought, what I'm describing as thought here, at least, does not occur mechanically as a result.  So it's probably possible to form thought and reason through certain things in small brains, in birds, pets, etc. And it's perhaps similar to what we're doing, remembering long reams of seeming nonsense, that we can then adjust and reason ourselves around. But this kind of thought is not a result of the individually mechanical functions becoming sufficiently complex.  So it's emergent from the system existing. But it's not a given that very sophisticated individually mechanical functions will result in that kind of thought I'm describing. In fact, I sincerely don't think that you need to be particularly \"advanced\" or complex to have that kind of thought to begin with.  What I mean by that is that if you designed AI that could appear to reflect and adjust it's \"thought process\", this would very quickly become awfully human-like(although we don't want to design robots that linger outside your window, because they are wondering what is luring them back. And we don't want robots that start questioning whether they should be building cars or not, or if there is purpose to their work. That's completely useless to us, so robots won't be programmed this way, but I digress).   But individually sophisticated networks of individual routines - no matter how complex, no matter how intertwined and relative to the next step it would be - will not end up having even the appearance of intelligent thought. It will have the appearance of a sophisticated routine. And that will always be the full extent of it.

The Ivy League is comprised of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, University of Pennsylvania, and Dartmouth. Some consider the corresponding women's colleges to be part of the Ivy League as well. While the Ivy League is often thrown at other institutions, it is really just the eight schools listed. One must also bear in mind that the Ivy League is actually a sporting league. the member schools just happen to be some of the most selective/academically rigorous in the country.  If you plan on living and working in the south, a degree from Duke, Alabama, Mississippi, Miami, or other established southern school will do more for your career than a degree from a northern Ivy as you are much more likely to have education in common with people around you, and that may be a tie-breaker or door-opener.  Your comment is quite correct. While the Ivy League does carry a certain panache, the costs may now be out of all proportion to what a student receives by way of the value of the education in a purely economic sense. Many of my classmates went to an Ivy for graduate school, and ended up with unpayable debt. My parents paid for my college education, and I went to the University of Wisconsin for Medical School on a partial scholarship. I wish I could say I ended up with no debt.  You touch on the real problem, government loans allowing tuition (and asset prices in many different asset classes for that matter) to skyrocket out of proportion to the actual value of the degree, and student's ability to pay. Institutions that accept federal support, even tax relief, should be required to present all of the academic material online. You can't get a degree, but you could get a very good education by watching lectures from Stanford, Harvard, etc instead of other content in your spare time. The real losers in all of this are not the universities, who would still get tuition from persons attending. The real losers would be lesser institutions and banks, who would lose students and borrowers respectively.  I remember going to look at colleges. I fell in love with Brown but wasn't accepted. I didn't get into Stanford either. I got into all of the Universities of California, and I got into Princeton and Carleton College in Minnesota. In making the decision as to where to go, I realized that Princeton would give me the opportunity to see what I could do against the stiffest competition available. Sometimes it went well, other times not so much. The experience made medical school less of a shock as I was already accustomed to many of the rigors that others were seeing for the first time.

Map some of these ideas onto politics.  First the wisdom of the crowd concept suggests that the status quo may in fact be preferable to any of the reform ideologies.    But that bottom-up, emergent systems concept, the non-violent revolutions and all that, suggest that the apparently emergent libertarian trend in Western feeling may also be a wisdom of the crowd outcome in development.  As you don't need critics to tell you want movies you'll like if you have massive self-organizing data from other users, so too, you may also not need politicians to make decisions of governance for you if you have consolidated input form millions/billions of humans.  In other words a true democracy rather than a representative republic may be in our emergent future.     That's kind of conceptually revolutionary for the fact that the current thinking on the subject is that libertarian self-governance only works for small tribe-sized groups, where everyone knows everyone else, and breaks down at larger population levels in a society where anonymity breeds lack of regulatory empathy and social pressure.  That large societies need authoritarian structures.      However, this lecture, with the idea that quantity begets quality(as we see in the sample-size criteria of social science studies) suggests the idea that emergent bottom-up systems like the one that recommends movies on Netflix - dependent precisely upon having a massive data-sample to generate accurate predictions - suggests that using technology to allow the generation and self-organization of a massive data-set of opinions, could produce averaged opinions that govern humanity better than the politician \"experts.\"    The idea that a communal/libertarian self-governing style requires a small population size may be turned upside down, as we begin to see that it may work much better, the larger the population size, BUT with the caveat that, just as the bees have to have a place where they come together and dance for each other to share collected data, we humans need a place to connect the individually collected data, and that place is the internet.

There are systems with non-injective time evolution functions that are sensitive to variations in initial conditions. 2. Such systems are common in biology.  Sapolsky also conflates linearity, sensitivity to initial conditions (chaotic), and time-reversibility. \u00a0He claims that the three are equivalent when in fact there are evolution functions for every yes/no combination of those three properties (except that there are no linear chaotic maps). \u00a0  Some examples:  time-irreversible but linear and non-chaotic: y[n+1] = 1  time-reversible and non-chaotic but non-linear: y[n+1] = y[n] ^ 2  What are the true relationships between complexity and the properties he mentions? \u00a0Far from all three being equivalent, the only general relationship I can think of is that noninearity is a necessary condition for chaos.\u00a0  Additionally, these two lectures complete misrepresent how reductionist science deals with uncertainty. \u00a0Variations in data are not simply considered \"measurement error\". \u00a0Almost all modern scientists use Bayesian inference to reason under uncertainty. \u00a0Models are built around our lack of knowledge about the physical systems they represent, including measurement errors and unknown details. \u00a0To use body temperature as an example, a reductionist model need not attribute temperature variations to lack of thermometer quality. \u00a0Instead, the variations are expected because our model considers \"body temperature\" to be a probability distribution with expectation equal to 98.6, but with a variance on the order of 1-2 degrees (so 99.6 would not be impossible). \u00a0  That being said, chaotic behavior is a huge problem for Bayesian inference. When probability mass is spread around in unpredictable and analytically unassailable ways, our simple probabilistic models fail. \u00a0However, that does not mean that reductionist approaches are doomed. \u00a0We can empirically build models of the chaotic behavior itself! \u00a0We represent our lack of knowledge about the future evolution of a system using time evolution functions that spread probability mass around an attractor. \u00a0This is done explicitly and implicitly across all branches of science.", "votes": "35", "replies": "6", "reply": false}, {"vid": "o_ZuWbX-CyE", "cid": "UgiiL5ZUMTA5BXgCoAEC", "comment": "Okay, this may be the best lecture of this already great series so far..

Imagine there were a God, and for some reason, his sole obsession were democracy - not carrying out his own will, but seeing that the average will of all the humans were carried out.

And that would be the election.   I'm just suggesting that perhaps in the future, in theory, when everyone has internet access, such software as the professor mentions, adding up massive data from monitoring the entire internet activity, could produce just such a result:  The average human will on any given topic.    And a humanity sympathetic to the ideology of democracy would be obliged to put that 'election' into practice.  Executive and Judicial branches of government would still be necessary, but such software could completely replace the Legislative branch and the legislative aspects of the presidency.  It would replace politicians and campaigns for office, leaving us with something that might best be described as a decentralized communist libertarian democracy.

What Sapolsky talks about here suggests(to me) the opposite, but with a contingency:  That a liberty-based model would work ever better the larger the population group, BUT that the massive amount of data has to be processed by machine.

I'm not a computer guy, but I think they call it \"cloud\" processing/cloud storage/cloud development.  That could be the wrong word, but the idea is that of decentralization of processing/storage/development of software.    In the old day of Naptster, we used to steal music, but the software was hosted on the Napster servers and, after a legal battle, the government shut it down.  That model was subsequently replaced by non-centralized alternatives, like the .torrent file sharing platform, and I think others, which allow files and the software to share those files to be hosted independently on millions of computers all talking to each other in a vast web.  To shut it down, any agency would have to prosecute all the millions of individual users separately, and that would not be cost-effective.  At least that's the idea.  So that's sort of  a decentralized cloud-storage/hosting.    A more upstanding side of this emergent phenomenon(not involving intellectual property theft), you can download a small program to host other sub-apps to allow scientific projects that require heavy processing to  utilize your computer processor when you're not using it, and automatically re-upload the processed data to the scientists.  This allows the scientists to perform such research without having to buy millions of dollars worth the computers.  They outsource the processing to charities, which are us, and it costs us nothing, in theory.  So I think of that as cloud-processing.  There is some centralization there: there is a scientists somewhere to whom all the data is eventually sent, but the processing is dispersed.   The Linux operating system what I think of as an example of \"cloud-development.\"  The original software was put out on the web, the whole code visible and available to everyone.  Everyone was allowed to modify it at will, so people kept improving it and putting it back out there.  People kept improvements they liked, disregarded code they didn't like, and more popular modifications became permanent in a kind of democratic 'survival of the fittest' code race, leading to the software's evolution.  Very much like biological evolution, which also was decentralized, unless one adopts a creationist view. (I'm still open to the idea of genetic tampering by aliens from outer space.)    So, those are just some loose seed concepts to which one might turn for a decentralized collection and processing of data by a program designed to estimate average human will.  It's worth noting, by the way, that such a program could be designed to constantly calibrate itself by testing itself with real-world predictions that can be verified by other means.  Predicting the stock markets or elections, for example, and then watching to see to what degree the predictions are correct.  The software would be tweaked over and over to get the predictions more and more accurate.  Effectively, it would be \"learning\" to take more and more factors into account as the human programmers(humanity itself) learn more about ourselves.   As we are not omnipotent, there would always be a margin of error.  But that's nothing new.  The question is whether we could shrink that margin down from current methods.  The benefit though would be not just from shrinking the margin of error but from an massive increase in cost efficiency in terms of real dollars and human effort.    Let me be frank; my personal intuition and assumption would be that such software could never work.  I only mentioned the idea in the context of Saplosky's lecture because I have heard stories that in fact similar software does work, contrary to my own intuition.  That it is used to predict fashion trends(which effect markets) and terrorist attacks.  If that is true and it works, it could be used for a a much wider array of purposes, including elections, by averaging the public will, thereby eliminating, in theory, the need for public representatives, allowing us to drastically upgrade democracy.   To put it succinctly, with regard to politics, such software could, in theory, allow us to:  use  the pre-existing dispersed computers of humanity to process the vast data of complexity in order to bring the accuracy of small scale tribal democracies to large democracies without the need for representative intermediaries.   When one follows this up, there are some really interesting thoughts that begin to emerge.  For example:  Person A, might vote Yes on some referendum, and person B might vote No.  But does that really mean the average will of the two of them is 50/50?  Consider that person A might feel very, very strongly on the issue, whereas person B might be ambivalent but only slightly leaning towards No.  The current voter system makes no distinction between strong feeling and relatively ambivalent disinterest.  That's not how we run our private lives.  If I have two children and one prefers ice cream with peanuts, but the other will gag and die if he eats peanuts, I'm getting the ice cream without peanuts.  Software that averages human will by collecting internet data, such as the frequency of certain words/phrases, numbers of articles and blog posts containing such phrases etc, would be, by default, weighting more heavily the desire of the person whose desire is stronger, if we assume that such a person will put their ideas out there more, effectively \"campaigning\" for their viewpoint.   Red flags should go up, however.  Do we really want that?  Is that really fair?  Should a person's vote count more if they care more?  And can we accurately assess strength of caring by such means?  Certainly not for individuals, but can we for societal average even, assuming margins of error on both sides will cancel each other out?    If we don't want that, the software could, in theory, be made to assign all data from a given individual to that individual and count that as one vote, rather than counting each word/phrase/article separately.  That would, however, require the end of anonymity on the internet, which I don't want.    Keep in mind, I really have only the barest notion of how such programs might work from watching some news program on it; I may have mischaracterized.    Having made that caveat, one can see that such an endeavor becomes ethically as well as technically complicated, as all revolutions are.  I don't even know for certain if I'd be in favor of it.  There would definitely be potential for such technology to be subverted for use in Orwellian schemes.  That threat should loom heavy in the mind, behind everything I'm suggesting.  In truth the clever find ways to subvert every system to serve their ends.  The self-interest of the clever has been winning the struggle for control of humanity at least since the invention of religion.    The problem with disregarding such potential is this:  If such software is possible, and the idea is out there, it will be used.  If not be us, for democracy, then by whom, and to what end?  Once technology enables a new capability, the old way of doing things ceases to remain feasible, even if it was better, which, in this case is dubious.  The biological analogy is that when the environment changes, the species must adapt; being fit for the previous environment is not longer sufficient.  We can not stop the world from changing; we can only try to assert our interests in the ever-evolving paradigm, inserting them into that web of complexity that is reality, in hopes of a preferable emergence.

As far as the \"cloud\" is concerned, I visited Seattle several months ago and from the techie people I talked to who are actually building the thing, it is unfinished and still being built as we speak, despite slews of advertisements on tv prematurely proclaiming that \"the cloud\" has arrived. Apparently there is not even a distinct blueprint for the final product, and they're just building it out experimentally as quickly as they can, apparently due to pressure from their managers to hurry up and beat their competitors to the chase. Or at least that's my best guess. Apparently \"the cloud\" is as confusing to the people building it as it is to you and me, which is both funny and a little disconcerting at the same time.

Have you heard of the Less Wrong community? I recommend checking it out. It would be easier for you to do a quick google search than me try to verbalize exactly what the community is about. Eliezer Yudkowsky (the main guy behind Less Wrong) has some great youtube vids and talks that are straightforward for the layman unlike some of the more bizarre indecipherable content on Less Wrong's blog site. He is also a proponent of the idea of \"the\" technological singularity.

You should definitely research DAOs - decentralized autonomous organizations. The concept is closely associated with the bitcoin blockchain and wikipedia has a good article on DAOs. There are lots of other very closely related concepts with similar acronyms such as \"Distributed Autonomous Communities\" (DACs) but DAOs are the most commonly discussed. Check out Ethereum, etc. You'll find it all in the wikipedia article.

This is only tangentially related to what you're talking about, but I always imagined that our algorithms and roaming bots would discover new equations and what you might call \"natural laws\" of physics and other scientific phenomena that we ourselves don't have the brain/computing capacity to discover on our own. Providing a window of sorts into \"alien\" technology and worlds of the sort Terence McKenna riffs on (another great source for ideas on these topics if you can get past his obsession with mushrooms and psychedelics)... Kinda like how google's DeepDream already uses artificial neural networks for pattern recognition for purposes of auto-classifying images, except these algorithms and bots would be intended for discovery of new patterns, new knowledge, new \"laws\" of the material and/or informational world (if you are one to separate the two). This is where it gets into the weirder (and imo really exciting) sci-fi territory, and I am just sitting back waiting for this stuff to start happening. I'm disappointed and a little bummed that it's not already happening now.   Wtf?

Thanks a lot voters. I've finally realized that you can't blame our policy makers or government. It's their job to enforce the results of our democratic process, stupid as the decisions of the public may be. It's weird and sad and depressing and why we need a new system like the one we're talking about right now. To back up a few points, your quote: \" For example:  Person A, might vote Yes on some referendum, and person B might vote No.  But does that really mean the average will of the two of them is 50/50?  Consider that person A might feel very, very strongly on the issue, whereas person B might be ambivalent but only slightly leaning towards No.  The current voter system makes no distinction between strong feeling and relatively ambivalent disinterest.\" ... This is why I consider myself libertarian, or \"market anarchist\" (NOT anarchist in the sense of the Berkeley brats sporting My Little Ponies hairstyles while burning trash cans to make a political statement). The \"invisible hand\" of the free market is able to weigh priorities better than any central planner and distribute resources in the most fair and efficient manner possible. Also, refer to earlier rant above about the results of a \"one person, one vote\" democracy system resulting in refugee crises and economic collapse instead of a world of pure scientific discovery set into hyper-drive (the greatest source of wealth of all).

The musings of a brilliant mind are a benediction.    You're right about the free market naturally having a mechanism for weighing strength of opinion(via dollars spent), but it also weighs and values opinions by wealth, and I don't think that's moral because, contrary to some  'laissez-faire' ideals I once held true, I no longer believe the free market awards wealth proportional to virtue/contribution with a very high correlation.  I think the wealthiest class has learned to beat the free-market system by skimming vast wealth out of an otherwise productive system via 'speculative investment' and market prediction, which contributes zero good or service(and, in fact, bogs down the intended free-market mechanisms) in order to extract wealth.    One could argue that wealth still goes disproportionately to the smartest, and thus the smarter opinions are weighted more heavily.  But I have been disappointed to fail to find a strong correlation in my personal observations between wealth and benevolence or intelligence and benevolence.  So, while the smarter opinions might get weighted more heavily, which sounds good, those opinions are not necessarily in the interest of the majority of people, and can cause great suffering.  What I'm suggesting, in more colloquial terminology, is that the bastards who run shit are a bunch of clever sociopaths.    So I am more of a Chomsky libertarian than a right-wing variety in that I mistrust not only government, but also the quasi-governmental power structures of big business, the interactions of which cease to be meaningfully voluntary once certain power thresholds are reached, or in absence of some curtailing greater power.    The political problem for humanity is not actually political, in my view.  It is one of biology, and resultant psychology.  It is that no matter the particular system we contrive by which to govern ourselves, or each other, the smart will always find ways to out-smart the dumb and use them as slaves.    There is one solution and I think you already agree.  It is to overcame inherent scarcity, via technology, thus removing the motivation itself for any form of enslavement, economic or otherwise, subtle or overt.  In that case, the smart either set the dumb free or kill them.  Hopefully the former.    Anyway, politics: I went there.  It's seldom a good idea.    You mention interesting sounding stuff that I'll have to look into, as I'm not already familiar:  \"less wrong,\" DAOs, DeepDream.  Thanks for the heads up.    Oh, I love the fascinating idea of the scientific singularity, but I can't quite bring myself to believe in it.  The reason being that it is based on projection of current exponential trends into the future, but trends are temporary.  To last a while and then they stop/revert, or change directions. Unforeseeable new factors inter the equation and change outcomes.  That doesn't mean it won't happen though.    I read somewhere recently that there is an old Chinese curse: \"may you live in interesting times.\"  The indication being that interesting times means war and famine and death, as opposed to the boring tranquility of pastoral peacefulness.  But it does seem, doesn't it, that in technology and progress, we've invented a new kind of 'interesting' that isn't war and death.

For me, personally, intelligence is attractive.  But it's the beauty of concepts, especially(but not exclusively) true concepts, and of the individual capable of the conceptual dance.  Not everyone can think in the abstract very well; the scarcity of the ability makes it the more valuable.    For a man who isn't inclined to that dance, I imagine a smart woman could put him out of his comfort zone, just as a man with two left feet could feel out of place on the dance floor.  I don't consider intelligence to be the highest virtue; I place it somewhere under kindness.   I definitely, definitely prefer intelligent women, though, and I suspect that most men do, contrary to a certain myth.   My theory about what attracts all men to women is 3 things, and only 3.  Physical beauty, kindness, intelligence.  Everything fits into one of those 3 categories(humor, for example, is an aspect of intelligence.)  (You may recognize those categories as Mind, Body, Soul, or by other terms.  An interesting parallel can be drawn to the Father(Mind), Son(Body), Holy Spirit(Soul) in Christian mythology.    It's a common motif.  In science, human biology is the study of the body.  The study of the 'mind' and 'soul' are lumped together in Psychology.  Both are considered part of the psyche, but when it comes to the issues people have, they are divided into Psychoses(mental issues) and Neuroses(emotional issues).    Anyway, for young men, Physical beauty is most important in a woman.  It trumps everything else, though that doesn't mean kindness and intelligence don't matter.  A lot of pretty girls don't learn to be kind, because they don't have to, to get what they want.  Later in life, when their looks fade, and men's priorities shift from beauty to kindness, they have difficulty.    By the way, I think you would be interested in Carl Jung if you are not already.  I recommend.    Finally, it occurs to me that your inquiry may have been more personal than abstract.

I would strongly suggest that Stanford wouldn't conduct such experiments during lectures intended to also serve the purpose of conveying interesting ideas to human viewers, as the effectiveness of the visual diagrams is lost in all entirety and the presentation in general becomes much less effective.

We cannot reasonably expect such a primate to follow the content of the lecture or realize that the projected diagrams are relevant. So now the question is, why did the great, prestigious Stanford University choose a non-human primate to film these lectures, rather than a competent human who could actually follow the flow of the lecture and realize that when the professor displayed a projection, the camera should focus on that, and not on the professor's face?", "votes": "51", "replies": "7", "reply": false}, {"vid": "o_ZuWbX-CyE", "cid": "UgiHSlYBpYOcT3gCoAEC", "comment": "Great lecture, but what kind of jackasses do they get to wield the camera?

However, I bet five bucks that this idea about small communities putting together small bits of information that compiles and solves a complex problem is always empirically never shown to be any more than a sum of vectors. The only reason we know any \"problem\" has been solved is because of intelligence, and if \"knowing\" means anything it means we know that life is more than absolute material interaction, that information creates a dynamic that is, as of yet, well beyond man's wisdom. Such a dynamic of information allows Man to step outside of his or her motivation and examine it. What if a similarly studied colony of ants who were only efficient enough to barely survive (in fact, let's say they are retrograde efficient, coming into existence from some \"chance\", and would die out in a matter of days) also produce the most beautiful patterns humans have ever seen? They might preserve the colony, study it, keep it alive accordingly, and figure out new laws for reproducing that original beauty. It is only captured because of an intelligence which desired the feature. When scientists study the genome, or whatever, they are looking for ways to survive, essentially. What survives? Efficiency, in a nut shell. If we were a species that had full awareness of the consciousness, passing into death from life with no doubt as to what comes next, no concern for eating, health, or pain, it could be theorized that all we would be interested in studying scientifically would be making beautiful patterns, or sounds. Perhaps, that is the experience of algae, or mold, which could be argued to be more a more successful organism than man in the world's past, present, or future.
