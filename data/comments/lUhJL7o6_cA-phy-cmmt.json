Energy and matter can't interchange one another according to Einstein's famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. Alpha emission is weak is not because it is not energetic. This is because\u00a0after helium nucleus of alpha particle has stolen some electrons from other atom to form an electron-shell before turning itself into a helium atom, then it will lose its penetrative\u00a0 power entirely where electron-shells of helium atom and other atom will bounce away from one another when they are colliding against one another.\u00a0Therefore alpha emission is not invasive. Since Einstein's famous equation is wrong therefore we can't use it to calculate energy leased during a radioactivity decay based on its loss mass. Enormous energy has been released from nucleus of a decaying atom tells us that generally the nucleus of most atoms is embedded with abundant photons. Energy and matter can't interchange one another according to Einstein's .If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend\u00a0you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

The problem is that we can not and do not have the colossal force to do this, because we are physically limited, we can only at most split up to a few fractions of sand, because we can not get the pieces too small to be divided again and so on , only the cosmic forces of the universe could make or a God out of infinite power.  It results in unsustainable paradoxes and absurdities to defend the thesis of the existence of indivisible material entities / elements, the atoms, as they considered Democritus and Leucippus, a thesis that Aristotle correctly rejected.  Why do we have to accept the existence of atoms if experience shows us that all compound bodies are divisible indefinitely to our last tactile-sensitive limits?  If all the material elements are breakable into smaller parts, from the softest to the hardest, an iron bar when we hit it kneads and looses small pieces of metal and sparks of fire - energy, revealing its divisibility to us, why then do we have to to accept that atoms (indivisible fragments of matter) exist?  This atomistic thesis leads us to the paradox well demonstrated by Anaxagoras and Aristotle, that the parts are greater than the sum of the whole, for the components of the self are indivisible and not eternal. The results are the only and most perfect to be realized in all corpus of corruptible and mortal, which results in the refutation of atomism by reduction to the absurd.  Another paradox reveals itself is not a fact of existing atoms but is not necessarily indivisible, it is not necessary to prepare an atom for its existence, for who can be indivisible, the ultimate of existence, eternal, indestructible, immune to all sorts of shocks and destructions. Existing and eternal exist, to probe and to separate the various clusters in concentrated points without space, resulting in an inexistence of cohesion / physical concretion and consequent non-existence of visualizing the bodies and material bodies! In what results in a further logical - qualitative refutation of atomism, by a new reduction to the absurd.  And finally, indivisible and eternal atoms unite with other equally indivisible and eternal atoms, through connections made of finite and divisible matter as is our physical - corporeal composition and that of all the animate and inanimate bodies of the world, is an absurd total in this thesis, for where would arise a divisible and finite matter that binds atoms, if these same atoms are all indivisible, eternal and indestructible particles? Of the very primordial atoms that gave birth to the whole universe? But would a finite and divisible matter arising from indivisible and eternal atoms not be an unacceptable corruption of the eternal and indivisible essence of atoms? An indivisible atom that gives rise to a divisible matter would not have to possess the germ of divisibility in its essence, revealing in the truth that it is no atom, but a corruptible and perfectly divisible matter, which would refute the very Democritean thesis of existence of atoms?  Do you perceive so much of metaphysical absurdities, paradoxes, and idiosyncrasies that the theory of atoms has borne since over 2600 years ago?  In the antithesis to the atomist theory, we can not observe and test the process of division ad infinitum, because obviously we have spatial and physical - temporal limits, but at least it is indirectly based on ordinary experience, being a much more rational and scientific hypothesis than considering the hypothesis of finite divisibility in final and eternal atoms, for we have no example of phenomenon or object observable in experience that is indivisible, indestructible, incorruptible, and eternal, whereas for the philosophical hypothesis of indefinite or infinite divisibility we have the support of a sensory experience that all objects, bodies and physical phenomena are divisible or decomposable into smaller, corruptible and destructible parts!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgwKJgJkirNopy-tqKd4AaABAg", "comment": "That was such a great explanation!\ud83d\udc4d Great graphics too", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgzC5xTQZZKFx7ODskF4AaABAg", "comment": "3:27 I find the words: 'put together', in this context very confusing.

Binding energy is a wrong concept. We all know electrons have very high velocities. Why protons and neutrons within a complex nucleus are \"stationary\"? Why they don't have very high velocities like the one of electrons since electrons derived their high velocities from the Big Bang explosion? Indeed protons and neutrons also have very high velocities, but they are balanced out within a nucleus where\u00a0all acting forces of nucleons within the nucleus must be balanced. So they balanced out in which those high kinetic energy that kept in the form of angular momentum\u00a0managed to squeeze them into nucleus and keep them in place.

You'd never hear a chemist say that burning coal releases energy because some of the mass of the coal is converted to kinetic energy.  Instead the chemist would say that chemical potential energy was released when the carbon combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide.  Yet the former explanation is technically true - the coal plus oxygen before the burning weighs a teeny tiny bit more than the carbon dioxide afterwards.  But that former explanation doesn't actually tell you anything interesting.  What's interesting is that CO2 is bound more strongly than a combination of pure carbon and pure oxygen, and that forming those bonds therefore releases energy.  It'd be more sensible to say that the energy of the molecules changed, or equivalently, the mass of the molecules changed (although in the case of chemical reactions, that mass difference is so small as to be unnoticeable), and the REASON for that change is the difference in chemical binding energies.  The fact that mass and energy are equivalent ends up being pretty irrelevant - might as well just talk about the difference in energy.  The same applies to, say, alpha decay.  If you measure the masses, you notice a difference, but that's not the CAUSE of the energy release - that's the EFFECT of the energy release.  That is, in fact, equivalent to saying \"there was energy released.\"  Because mass and energy are the same thing.  The CAUSE of the energy/mass release is the difference in nuclear binding energies, akin to the difference in chemical binding energies in the previous example.  What's remarkable is that this energy release is so LARGE that we CAN measure it via measuring masses (whereas in chemical reactions the energy differences are negligible compared to the actual masses involved).    Besides, technically the \"masses\" (in the sense of relativistic mass, in the sense of the \"mass\" that Einstein was thinking of when he wrote E=mc^2) of the products are exactly equal to the reactants, IF we include their kinetic energy.  Only once we slow that alpha particle down below relativistic speeds, thus robbing energy (and mass) from the system, do we notice that it weighs less than before.    Basically, what \"E=mc^2\" told us is not that \"energy can be converted into mass and vice versa,\" it told us that the thing we used to call mass is actually the energy of an object, and therefore it changes when we add or subtract energy to that object.    This all gets a little muddy once you take into account the fact that physicists usually use the word \"mass\" to describe a second, related concept: \"rest mass.\"", "votes": "13", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UggELglLq5ssBHgCoAEC", "comment": "What is the spectrum of nuclear explosion?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgjLFRIbgDlIRHgCoAEC", "comment": "if the atomic mass number don't change how could the mass change?", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "Ugx0w5xK6eWZdXQmwv54AaABAg", "comment": "Why couldn't she be ugly \ud83d\ude2d I can't focus", "votes": "31", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgwQYQitr6MZPSaPJg14AaABAg", "comment": "Was this posed to be cemititrey?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "Ugz-MgSOOWhD9ca2iFl4AaABAg", "comment": "Halflife 3 confirmed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 whoever does the edits for these is a genius. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "Ugxchc5h_zJvtEhqfuF4AaABAg", "comment": "I wish she wouldn't talk sooooo fricking fast, It's like Elliot from scrubs on speed! :o", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "Ugy6DoMRuV8AYQYTjZ94AaABAg", "comment": "Do you think people in the in the distant future will still be wondering when HL3 will be released?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgwPiMam0PhoRarHzll4AaABAg", "comment": "Very interesting video", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgxgdHMEl8g1s-J2WHh4AaABAg", "comment": "Half-Life 3 Confirmed :-)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "lUhJL7o6_cA", "cid": "UgwRBimc6EgzGZXonfN4AaABAg", "comment": "@8:12.

See what I mean, it is complicated! And I don't know the specifics well enough to use analogy yet! But basically, yes, it has to do with the fact that they are both composed of quarks with mediate through the strong interaction at close ranges which creates protons and neutrons, and at the somewhat extended ranges of an atom, residuals of that close range interaction still affect them.   So the more quark stuff you have, the more residual strong interaction you have. But the more stuff you have, the longer the range gets which dampens the effect.

But human speech has a natural rhythm to it, we make pauses or speed up or slow down certain passages to get a point across. That seems completely missing here, making everything feel very rushed.  Yes, it's a crash course, so of course the material will be densely packed and require multiple viewings to fully comprehend, maybe even the use of the pause button - while retaining a slightly slower speech tempo. My point is that there's a big difference between processing the information contained in a sentence (I'm OK with that being challenging) and being able to follow the words that make up the sentence.   I guess what happens with many of these crash courses is, that they do multiple takes, and if you repeat a given sentence over and over, you naturally speed up and say it faster, then in the edit things get cut even tighter, cutting away small moments of silence. The effect feels really rushed, and all that would be needed would maybe add up to 30 seconds longer videos. it's not like PBS doesn't know how to do that - look at PBS SpaceTime or PBS Infinite Series for comparison. The hosts talk a little slower, the takes are longer, but it is still packed with information - and the videos have roughly the same length.
