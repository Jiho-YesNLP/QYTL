One of the greatest physicists ever who said: \u201cIf I have seen further, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants\u201d.  We know about Isaac Newton very well, but we do not recognize the \u2018Giants\u2019. We are aware of the famous picture of Isaac Newton, where he is seen experimenting with light. But we are not aware that the same experiment was done by Ibn al-Haytham more than seven centuries before him.\r \r Muslim scientists such as Thabit ibn Qurra and Ibn al-Haytham wrote about calculus. We know of Ibn al-Haytham and his writings about gravity. Abu Bakr al-Razi, centuries before Newton, made a strong distinction between absolute and relative space; absolute space, which is three dimensional and infinite, exists quite independently of the bodies contained in it. And Ibn Sina tried to relate velocity with weight, which is a precursor to the concept of momentum. These discoveries are all connected to Newton.  \r Let\u2019s look at Newton\u2019s laws of motion. Ibn Sina and Ibn al-Haytham, among others, are seen to be writing about Newton\u2019s law of inertia, the first law of motion. Abul Barakat Al-Baghdadi writes that force is proportional to acceleration, which we get to know from the second law. Ibn Bajja wrote that for every force there is a reaction force, which became the forerunner to Newton\u2019s third law of motion.\r \r So how do so many things that Newton worked come to light as being described by Muslim scientists long before his discoveries?\r \r The \u2018Giants\u2019 they say, are Copernicus, Kepler, Descartes, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo. But actually, it just might be that Sir Isaac Newton was influenced by Muslim scientists.\r \r ADVERTISE ON TMV\r \r In his writings, there are clear marks of influence from Ibn Tufail\u2019s philosophical romance Hayy ibn Yaqzan (Alive Son of Awaken). It is known that both the Latin and English translations of the book by Edward Pococke and Simon Ockley  were available at Isaac Newton\u2019s time. Ibn Tufail\u2019s influence is seen in other philosophers, scientists, and fiction authors of the time too.\r \r The talented man he was, Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s name is frequent. Isaac Newton even kept a copy of Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s magnum opus, Kitab al-Manazir in his personal library.\r \r Many laugh at Jabir ibn Hayyan for his alchemy, considering it irrational. Jabir ibn Hayyan didn\u2019t try to create gold out of silly stuff without a system; rather his process was more scientific and experimental. Many people in fact, get shocked when they find out that Sir Isaac Newton also practiced alchemy. And, he didn\u2019t only practice alchemy, he read Jabir\u2019s book and was influenced by it. A book called Summa Perfectionis was based on the Arabic work Kitab al-Mulk, from the Jabirian Corpus. It was translated into English by Richard Russell, and appeared in three other versions, one of which was Willam Starkey\u2019s Secrets Reveal\u2019d, the one which Newton owned.\r \r So, perhaps, Newton\u2019s ideas didn\u2019t fall from an apple tree after all.

This means that he was convinced that there is a recurring natural disaster battering our planet. That information can be found in several ancient books that claim that there is a cycle of seven natural disasters. Such a disaster can only be caused by a ninth planet in our solar system. Planet 9 is a frightening planet, therefore it is very well known for thousands of years in the history of mankind. And it is seen in broad daylight with the naked eye, just before our era. We even have pictures of this event. Those disasters are causing a huge tidal wave, massive floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and a bombardment of fiery meteors every few thousand years. Several animal species become extinct and mankind hardly survives. The only possible natural cause of this cycle can be a ninth planet in our solar system, orbiting our sun in an eccentric orbit. We have pictures of the approaching planet, ancient sources show us the orbit of planet 9 and its whereabouts. Just east of Pisces. And it looks like LL Pegasi, the spiraled cloud, also just east of Pisces. Coincidence?  To learn much more about planet 9, the recurring flood cycle and its timeline, the re-creation of civilizations and ancient high technology, read the e-book: \"Planet 9 = Nibiru\".

Consider the man (THE EYE) that actually IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d. Think about TIME, AND notice the associated DOME AND black \u201cspace\u201d AS WELL !!! IMPORTANTLY, now, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON/IN BALANCE !!!! GREAT !!! So, of course, consider what is THE SUN ON/IN BALANCE; AND think about the speed of light (c) AS WELL. Great !!! NOW, consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS actually standing ON what is THE EARTH/ground (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! Time AND SPACE are proportionately extended AND BALANCED, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Accordingly, ON BALANCE, TIME AND time dilation ULTIMATELY prove (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY gravity !!! Regarding WHAT IS the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS actually standing ON what is THE EARTH/ground, touch AND feeling BLEND; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE, AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky (ON BALANCE) !! Great. Gravitational force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE on balance, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). This CLEARLY explains F=ma AND E=mc2 ON BALANCE, as this NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. SO, carefully consider why there is something instead of nothing ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!! Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE on balance, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). This explains F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY (AND CLEARLY) represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). This also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. Indeed, get a good LOOK at what is the orange AND SETTING Sun ON BALANCE. In DIRECT (AND proper) comparison, they are BOTH necessarily the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE. E=MC2 IS F=MA. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. (Carefully consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE.) \u201cMass\"/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. \u201cMass\"/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, as E=mc2 IS F=ma; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Great. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course). Beautiful. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE, as balance AND completeness go hand in hand. Balanced inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. I have explained the cosmological redshift, the supergiant stars, stellar clustering, what is a quasar, the fourth dimension, AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE. It makes perfect sense ON BALANCE that THE PLANETS move away very, very, very, very slightly in relation to what is the Sun. Great. What is a galaxy does consist of invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE. Importantly, it involves stars together AND stars apart ON BALANCE. Consider the supernovae AND the birthing of stars together. There is no need for any \u201cdark matter/ENERGY\". ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) in accordance with the fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma ON/IN BALANCE. Again, this necessarily represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES why there is something instead of nothing (ON/IN BALANCE) in accordance WITH what is possible/potential AND actual (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Great. Carefully consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE !!!! Magnificent !!!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!!! TIME AND time dilation ULTIMATELY prove (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY gravity !!! E=MC2 IS F=MA. Consider what is the role OR RELATION of THE EYE ON BALANCE.

(Notice what are the associated DOME AND black \u201cspace\u201d AS WELL.) The second dimension is BALANCED between one AND three dimensions. It is a balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE in relation to the fourth dimension as well. I have mathematically unified physics. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).  THE ULTIMATE AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL AND OBSERVATIONAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS PROVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACT THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA (ON/IN BALANCE):  Regarding physics/physical experience, BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma, as this clearly explains the ONE dimensional aspect (AND manifestation) of the SPACE that we inhabit; as it constitutes what is a BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE that is (balanced) between what is the speed of light (c) AND what is the Sun; as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE. Accordingly, THE PLANETS move away very, very, very, very slightly in relation to what is the Sun. I have explained the cosmological redshift AND the supergiant stars. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma, as the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. On balance, THE EYE CLEARLY represents a TWO dimensional surface OR SPACE ON BALANCE that is (again) in balance WITH what is E=mc\u00b2; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Great. c\u00b2 CLEARLY represents what is a dimension of SPACE (ON/IN BALANCE). LOOK at what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!!! Magnificent. ON BALANCE, I have (CLEARLY !!!) explained what is the fourth temporal dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations.  By Frank DiMeglio  E=MC2 AS F=MA CLEARLY PROVES (ON BALANCE) WHY AND HOW THE PROPER AND FULL UNDERSTANDING OF TIME (AND TIME DILATION) UNIVERSALLY ESTABLISHES THE FACT THAT ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY:  A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Indeed, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Indeed, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. Great. \"Mass\"/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=mc2 IS F=ma. (Very importantly, outer \"space\" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. I have mathematically unified physics/physical experience, as I have CLEARLY proven that E=mc2 IS F=ma in what is a truly universal and BALANCED fashion.  By Frank DiMeglio  WHY AND HOW THE BALANCED, TOP DOWN, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH F=MA AND E=MC2:  The following also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution.  c squared represents a dimension of SPACE on balance WITH the fact that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Indeed, the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE (on balance) !! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c) (ON BALANCE); AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND necessarily) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).  General Relativity is directly taken from Special Relativity. E=mc2 is taken directly from F=ma. CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. I have exposed Einstein. Beautiful.  Note: Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Think carefully about the black \u201cspace\u201d AS WELL. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. THE EYE represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) that is consistent with F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE.  Consider what is THE SUN. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations.

And since I learned from this video that there is always an equal and opposite force, that means that when the first skater applied that 120N force on the second skater it was also applied back to him (-120N). And so now knowing the mass (120kg) and force (-120N) of the first skater, I used the same formula (F = ma --> a = F/m) to find his acceleration, and you get that a = -120N/120kg = -1m/s^2.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgxYO1-CW-7nm7CAEi54AaABAg", "comment": "He teaches better than my teacher \ud83d\ude2d", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgxlGvzYZiWS--fKvO14AaABAg", "comment": "i listen to this in order to sleep bro.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgzASV1KAStB6UEc1Op4AaABAg", "comment": "your voice sounds its coming from far away in all your videos I wish you could fix that", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgxtDc36vvLQ1fOwBTx4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you so much", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgytaEfCwmM6kd8G84R4AaABAg", "comment": "Dragon Ball Z been teaching us physics for a long time.

Every attempt is being made to bring Mass'querade, both the Movie and the Theory, to the attention of those physicists who understand there are holes in the Standard Model and a complete lack of a viable explanation for the composition of the Electron and all the Sub-Atomic particles and certainly a gap between why any particle seems drawn towards a 'gravitational object'. Gravity is finally explained and should lead to the creation of Gravitational Propulsion.   The charge of the particles is a complete mystery in every other theory except Mass'querade.  The day should come when 'Science' realizes that virtually everything they are lacking can be found in Mass'querade: The Theory of Everything.\r \r It will help for the students of Mass'querade to ask some very pointed questions of their instructors.  \"What is an Electron made of\"  \"Why is a Positron 'positive\"?  \"Why are Quarks precisely +/- 1/3 and 2/3\"? \"Was Dr. Einstein right when he stated, \"Reality is merely and illusion...\"?  \"What is a blackhole made of\"?  \"Why does LIght bend around the Sun?\"  \"Does having 'mass' mean a particle 'must have Gravity'\"?  Their truthful answer is \"I don't know.\", or \"No one knows.\" That is the time to offer a brand new answer for all these questions.  \"Mass'querade\" knows.\r https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0kPK8FNDms   :: The Teaser\r https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cga2020/massquerade-the-movie  :: The Project", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgwywdaCisTnFD3yTMN4AaABAg", "comment": "Let's play roblox", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "Ugw2f7id8wO2sNGKMxF4AaABAg", "comment": "Question at 3rd law of Newton. @ 21:00  While you're at space, your mass is 0 correct?

Abstract: in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force, and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory\u3001\u3001\u3001", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "g550H4e5FCY", "cid": "UgwPDGbG2InZ-lkN_gF4AaABAg", "comment": "Dude, thank you so much for what you do.

Global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer is because we humans have altered the composition of elements in the earth's atmosphere, the composition that was once balanced and natural has now changed due to our activities. There's a number of stuff that has changed the atmosphere: burning fossil fuels, manufacture and extraction of elements from the earth which in turn pollutes the atmosphere with harmful gases, once the usage of chlorofluorocarbons, etc, etc. Moreover, if mass had in any way contributed to this, then the earth would've been perished lonng ago by dinosaurs or other massive creatures. Lastly, gravitational pull of the sun pulls on every kilogram of mass of an object that is within it's range, keeping all the planets in their respective orbits- I don't know how to get to this but- increase in mass causes increase in gravitational pull of the object being pulled by gravity, NEVER decrease in distance or gravitational force, that just doesn't make sense.
