If I want to set up a new ISP in some small town a hundred miles away from the nearest place I already have high bandwidth access to the internet, then I need to set up 100 miles of cable to get data to and from the town. That's a significant upfront investment and the money to do that has to come from somewhere.   If I'm the first to run a wire into town, then that gives me a temporary monopoly, and I can set my prices high enough to cover that setup cost and the running costs and then lower prices after a couple of years once I've got back my initial investment and only need to cover ongoing maintenance. Once that happens, if Bob comes along and decides that he wants to set up a second ISP in town, either he needs to make a deal with me to use my cable, or he needs to spend the money to run a second hundred mile cable. If he pays me for the use of my cable, I can set the price high enough that he can't afford to compete with my prices; if he runs his own cable, then he can't afford to compete with my prices until after he's paid off the cost of that cable.   So, without any government intervention, in either direction, internet provision is a natural monopoly. It's just massively more efficient for there to just be one cable into town, so one set of building costs, and one set of ongoing maintenance costs, rather than having two or more companies maintaining separate cables.   Government intervention can make matters worse - for example, by subsidising the first cable into town - but it's not needed in order for there to be a strong tendency for there to only be a single ISP in a given region.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "guvsH5OFizE", "cid": "UgwlVyBsL1K0PKUB4XV4AaABAg.8YJ_Mz4DxdY974dMeM4xrR", "comment": "\u200b\u00a0@rmsgrey\u00a0 I understand your argument, you believe there would still be many monopolies without governemnt intervention because of the high cost of entry/expansion. It's a valid argument, but let's check whether the premises are true.   As a general rule, the less competition, the higher the prices and the lower the quality. So, you have your work cut out for you in supporting the political oppression of entrepreneurs. I'm not calling you a bad person, I think most people haven't internalized that regulations are enforced at the point of a gun and threatening innocent people doesn't improve society. That's one rebuttal that's both on moral and economic principle grounds.   But to address your main point that ISPs would be monopolies without government and the reason it would be even worse is because resources would be wasted by people trying and failing to compete, I have a few rebuttals.   1) You seem to think you're smarter than the average entrepreneur (and maybe you are) because you believe that entrepreneurs would continue to invest money into a business that's destined to fail. But it's extremely unlikely that that would happen if, like you said, one cannot compete with an established ISP. Investors would simply not give entrepreneurs the capital to try to compete if it's so clear they can't.   2) It's not true that businesses can only offer reasonable prices once they're making a profit. Plenty of successful companies start off offering competitive prices while their books are still in the red. Some companies operate at a loss for years before making a profit.   3) Your example of a small town 100 miles away is designed to constrain the debate too much in your favor. It's an exception to the rule.   4) Satellite internet, while slower and more expensive than average, would still be a check on the prices of the local ISP.   5) Monopolies are not better for the consumer than a number of competing companies just because they only require one set of buildings and infrastructure. You're ignoring the fact that if other companies are prevented from competing with the monopoly, it can raise prices and run the company poorly all it wants because nobody else is offering an alternative.

This preys on \"users rarely look carefully at urls\" - so they don't notice that the link was to \"SomePopuIarSite.com\" (capital I instead of lowercase l) 2) Assuming I have greater means at my disposal (like if I have control of a router between you and the backbone), you're still vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack where I convince your browser to come to my site instead of somepopularsite.com . I just have to go the extra step to also spoof the certificate authority's site and deliver my public key to your browser, too (there's protection against this kind of hack in that your request for certificate is encrypted, too, but eventually you must have to get a public key for someone somewhere in a non-encrypted manner to start it all off and let you start reading encrypted things that give you keys to get the keys to get the keys to get my site's keys)  (I'm not a security or hacking expert, and there are probably errors in there - they are hopefully the result of lack of knowledge rather than stupidity - please be gentle when correcting me)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "guvsH5OFizE", "cid": "Ugz2Gq1cJoqvCtdxL2N4AaABAg.8YJUMt4iPPV8YJk34F8SYP", "comment": "You mean <head>. <header> is meant to be a tag for layouts which essentially functions like a div but operates better with screenreaders for accessibility.", "votes": "30", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "guvsH5OFizE", "cid": "Ugz2Gq1cJoqvCtdxL2N4AaABAg.8YJUMt4iPPV8YMKllzmlMU", "comment": "+blauerninja  To be completely pedantic, <head> was actually made optional in HTML5.

Working for Comcast? AT&T? WB? A QoS service that runs on ISP networks and backbones absolutely violates net neutrality because differentiating kinds of services is as severe a violation of the core concept of neutrality as endpoints. If you pay your ISP for a certain speed of connection, and they then prioritize or deprioritize certain kinds of traffic unless you pay for their QoS \"Mega Streaming Bundle,\" then that's just as bad. You're paying for the speed of your connection and then also a fee for how you use that speed?  That you paid for already? No endpoint differentiation required; all prioritization of traffic on any criteria violates net neutrality. That is in fact how they are most likely to start dragging us all into the worst case scenario. Besides, as many above me have pointed out, implementations vary far to much to identify traffic reliably by anything BUT the endpoint. What's behind your great love of QoS anyway? Pay for a faster connection. Unless you share access across a LAN, or live in a rural area with limited bandwidth, QoS at the WAN level isn't going to impact your service because that's not where the bottleneck is. If QoS is going to help you then you need it on your router locally anyway or else it's not going to make any difference. Also, it may seem obvious to you that video should take priority over email, but not all users are going to agree with you. Checking email requires almost no bandwidth by today's standards; if your streaming HD video has even a few seconds worth of video buffered any email download on the same connection is going register as barely a blip.

But those other reasons are not something NN excludes. You could have an endpoint-neutral network (what NN means, and what she's been discussing prior to that point), and still prioritize by type of traffic, so needing to prioritize by type of traffic is not a reason not to have an endpoint-neutral network. You can have both.  And Jivan: we DO currently have both, so the technical concerns are irrelevant, because they've long since already been addressed, since we're doing that right now, and have been doing that basically forever. Prioritizing by type but not endpoint is how the internet has been handled for ages, and how we (pro-NN) want it to stay. I don't know why you think \"endpoint\" means \"local\", but I think you're confused on the terminology. \"Endpoint-neutral\" means neutral with respect to WHO sent the packets, in contrast to WHAT the packets contain. We have always prioritized by \"what\", and what Carrie Anne is saying at 10:40 are the reasons why we need to. What's being debated is whether the ISPs can prioritize by \"who\". They never did before, and now that they're trying to start, we (pro-NN) want to ensure that they can't, and things stay how they have always been, instead of getting worse.

Somehow or another ISPs are able to tell what kind of service what packets go with, and prioritize them based on that. I would guess that it's some combination of many things, like port number and some degree of packet inspection (looking for identifying headers).  One thing people have raised in concern in this thread is that ISPs can't inspect encrypted packets, but I'm pretty sure that the headers of encrypted packets are still readable, so the ISP can tell that it's e.g. HTTPS vs SSH vs VPN, even if it can't see what's being sent over those protocols.
