There is no doubt about it. We then have to do two integrals of this square root 2, which is also multiplied by the function, which is just plainly, z, which in turn, can be substituted by a simple x+1. I think we both followed the same path so far.  The mistake that I made that was probably similar to yours was that I plugged in the limit value of x(0,1) BEFORE I even integrated it, which in hindsight is a rookie mistake. Meaning I calculated (x+1)*sqrt(2), so I thought \"okay I will just plug in 1 for x\", thus gaining (1+1)*sqrt(2) aka 2sqrt(2). I integrate it by adding an extra X, which is 1, so it remains 2sqrt(2). But this is the wrong order.  You're supposed to INTEGRATE the result first and THEN plug in the number. Meaning that (x+1)*sqrt(2) should be integrated. By integrating it, you get ((x^2)/2+x)*sqrt(2). Distribute the root 2 across both terms. Now plug in the 1. Now you get 0.5sqrt(2)+1sqrt(2), or 1.5sqrt(2). From then on just proceed to integrate in regards to y. The integral will add an extra y, you plug in 2, and thus you get 2*1.5sqrt(2) or 3sqrt(2).

However, there often are ways you can parametrize it that will significantly simplify the remaining work.  For instance, in your example, I could parametrize it as: x = u*cos(3*v) y = u*sin(3*v) z = 3*v  But I wouldn't really accomplish anything by making a more complicated definition of my parameter v.
