There is no specific name for that pair of angles.  Step 1: we relate angle d to an angle in the same group as angle g.  Angle d and angle h are called corresponding angles.  All you need to do is translate angle d along the diagonal line, and you see it lines up perfectly with angle h.  Step 2: notice that angles g and h are arranged such that they add up to a straight angle.  This means they are supplementary angles, which implies they add up to 180 degrees.

Thank you very much! I got a question regarding your latest videos. What is the reason that you decided to make videos of what is basically preschool level math? These are all basic things that will probably only be relevant to kids below the age of 10 . I find your effort wasted on such videos and believe you would do much better by focusing more on Highschool/University level math and science like the videos you made that I enjoyed watching.
