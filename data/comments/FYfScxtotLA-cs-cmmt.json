[{"vid": "FYfScxtotLA", "cid": "UgyEMH3HHBru7_x1EkR4AaABAg", "comment": "No, you do not subtract 2 from the number of subnets. The subtraction of 2 applies only to the number of hosts within each subnet, not to the number of subnets.\r \r Here\u2019s why:\r \r - **Subnets**: The calculation for the number of subnets is straightforward. For 6 bits used for subnetting, \\(2^6 = 64\\) subnets are created. The subnetting process simply divides the network into smaller subnetworks, and each of these subnets is valid.\r \r - **Hosts per Subnet**: The formula \\(2^n - 2\\) is used for calculating the number of usable hosts per subnet, where \\(n\\) is the number of bits available for hosts. The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address and the broadcast address, which are not assignable to hosts.\r \r In summary:\r - **Number of Subnets**: No subtraction needed; use \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of bits used for subnetting.\r - **Number of Usable Hosts per Subnet**: Subtract 2; use \\(2^n - 2\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of bits remaining for hosts.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FYfScxtotLA", "cid": "UgyvqjO9z41xkpD01Z14AaABAg", "comment": "62 wrong networks bits are 2^6 = 64", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FYfScxtotLA", "cid": "Ugy6VkTQNpPOvvlI9QV4AaABAg", "comment": "If t was me in the exam, i will write : non from above, bc the question did not specify the num of RFC", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "FYfScxtotLA", "cid": "Ugy_8M-CEbXipd8BhtJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Subnet Never get Subtract by 2 But As Per Question the answer will be considered as based on 1022 host and 62 subnets.
