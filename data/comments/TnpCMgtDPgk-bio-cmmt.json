What I am talking about is the following thing: You want to ask something about a \"Poly A tail\" but it seems that you don't have in mind that those Poly A tails only occur in RNA, not in DNA. Your suggestion to use G, T or C implies that there have to be molecules like GTP, TTP or CTP. In the case of GTP and CTP you would be right but there's a problem with TTP. It turns out that it only exists dTTP or UTP. There is no TTP or dUTP. Those molecules simply does not exist in an living organism. Therefore there is no way a RNA Poly T taile could be formed.  \"O.k. so far so good\", you might think, \"but my question still stands: Why s dat only Poly A tail is added and not Poly G or U or C at the end.\" (to use your way of english) ???  Well, now we have a real question which can be considered. There are those molecules ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP. So why does the cell only use ATP to form a Poly A tail and not GTP, UTP or CTP? To answer this question we have to look at it from a completely different angle. Most of the time the energy household of a cell is managed via the usage of ATP as an energy resource/an energy storage. Since cells often have to handle meaningful amounts of energy they also have a kind of big amount of ATP itself. Since GTP, UTP and CTP are not used to store and/or provide energy the concentration of those molecules are quite low. Therefore it turns out that the concentration of ATP in a cell is much much higher than the concentration of GTP, UTP or CTP. This fact causes that it is much easier to form a Poly A tail instead of other variants. If it was a Poly C tail for instance the cell would have to produce more CTP just to fulfill this purpose of forming a Poly C tail. This extra production of GTP, UTP or CTP would need an extra amount of energy. So long story short: To form a Poly A tail is much more energy efficient than forming a tail out of other nucleotides.
