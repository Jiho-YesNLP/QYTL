It seems to me that you're saying the battery (galvanic cell) powers the flow of electrons in an electrolytic cell by reversing the flow of electrons so that an otherwise non-spontaneous redox reaction can occur.

Sure, I would love answer any of your questions.  Firstly, lets get something straight. An electrolytic cell is not a battery. But a battery and an electrolytic cell are both electrochemical cells. A battery is one type of electrochemical cell in which a spontaneous Redox reaction allows you to generate an electricity source. On the other hand, an electrolytic cell allows a non-spontaneous Redox reaction to take place with the help of a battery.

I just wonder if you can clear some of my confusion.   1)If the battery is the electricity source in this kind of cell, then why are electrons being taken from the anode? I thought that the purpose of the battery was to power the redox reactions, so shouldn't the battery provide the electrons?   2)Why is the anode positive for electrolytic cells & negative for galvanic cells? I thought it should + in both cells b/c oxidation always occurs at the anode.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}]
