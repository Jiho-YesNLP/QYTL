The uppermost bits overflow into the lower bits: it's called \"ones' complement\" or \"end-around carry\".  This is because the values to be summed are not the individual octets but rather pairs of octets treated as 16-bit numbers.  Thanks to this clever \"ones' complement\" hack, it doesn't matter whether your computer is a 386 that thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet \u2014 it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little. There's also another clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's minus the sum of the packet data.  This means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the whole packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.  (This turns out to be a big deal for network encapsulation \u2014 where your UDP payload is another entire packet with its own IP, UDP etc. headers \u2014 because it means you can calculate the outer checksum just by looking at the outer headers, since you know the inner packet with a correct checksum adds up to zero.  This is called Local Checksum Offload, and was invented by, erm, _me_.  But I think the people who originally designed the Internet Protocol checksum are the ones who really deserve the credit, because it's their brilliant design that made it possible.)  7:29 The main reason for using UDP instead of TCP isn't the ACKs and the bandwidth they use, it's that latency-sensitive applications generally want each individual packet delivered as soon as possible \u2014 they don't want new data to be buffered up in the OS just because it's still waiting for some old data that's supposed to come before it but maybe isn't even relevant any more.  This rationale applies to everything from video chat (I already displayed that frame with low resolution and glitches, it's too late now to tell me what it should have shown, I want the next video frame ASAP) to financial trading (give me the most recent stock price, I don't care what the price 10 microseconds ago was!).  Lag is caused not by ACKs but by waiting for retransmissions and enforcing ordering constraints that \u2014 at the application layer \u2014 may be totally irrelevant.  9:11 Technically (and yes I'm being pedantic now), the very top of the tree are the _root name servers_, 'a.root-servers.net' through 'm.root-servers.net'.  10:05 Oh no, not the OSI 7-layer burrito.  Real-world networking implementations don't look anything like that over-engineered heap (does anyone really understand wtf the Presentation Layer corresponds to in the Internet protocol stack?)  The standard protocol stack today combines the physical and data-link layers into Ethernet (attempts to separate them out conceptually founder on the way the data-link part of it gets waaaay too intimate with the physical part).  Similarly, some of the network layer's functions are handled by 'layer 4' protocols like TCP or UDP, and some functions that OSI puts in the transport layer are done either by IP or by other layer-3 protocols that go straight on top of Ethernet rather than being wrapped in IP datagrams.  Sometimes the layering even differs between IPv4 and IPv6: ARP, which is considered a link layer function, is layered on top of Ethernet, making it network layer; its IPv6 equivalent, Neighbour Discovery, is part of ICMPv6, sent inside IPv6 datagrams, making it technically a transport layer protocol! Certainly the Internet protocol suite is layered, but the trouble with the OSI model is that it's so neat and theoretically elaborated that it sounds like it should be a strict and precise thing, whereas real, working networks are inevitably messy and don't follow neat layering boundaries.  See also RFC3439.  While the OSI model does give us a few nice names (\"Layer 3\", \"Layer 4\", and also (though it doesn't actually define it itself) \"Layer 8\" for the \"user's intentions and behaviour\" layer), it shouldn't be taught without a warning that it's basically a cross between numerology and stamp-collecting.", "votes": "74", "replies": "8", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AEaKrq3SpW8", "cid": "Ugwqzd_hpP5_j-ArsqZ4AaABAg", "comment": "I can't believe nobody has bought asdlkjsdflkjsdlkjdsf.com yet.  $12.99 on hover.com", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "AEaKrq3SpW8", "cid": "Ugw1tSL4bFIQ3LuTm3h4AaABAg", "comment": "The OSI model doesn't really apply to the TCP/IP stack, hence it having it's own model.

This is known as network address translation (NAT). On the receiving end (like Youtube) their web server probably has a private IP on their local LAN which gets mapped to a public IP to receive and respond to requests. This lets Youtube do neat tricks with load balancing between multiple servers for the best possible response time and also update servers without people noticing any downtime and they don't need 1000s of public IPs to do it either.

The IPv4 protocol can contain only 4228250625 unique adresses, but there are way more physical devices, connected to the internet, and we can't assign every one of them a unique ip address. The solution I can think of is to have the top level routers split up the network into smaller bits (where the user count is below 4 billion) and then assign unique ip addresses, but then we run into the issue of having to know two (or more) ip addresses per device, one for the router, one for the device. Also, those routers would have to be monsterous to handle that amount of data and supply an adequate amount of latency.

Look them up for a lot more info.  1.  IPv6.  Instead of using a puny 32 bits for the address, use 128 bits, allowing for a much larger number of devices to have unique addresses.  2. NAT.  Using Network Address Translation, a router receives a unique IPv4 address for its physical interface to the Internet.  The router then hands out a unique address  to all the devices attached to it's other side, the private LAN.   The trick is that the addresses that the router hands out are duplicated behind every router.  i.e. Router A hands out addresses 192.0.0.1 - 192.0.0.255, and so does Router B and C, etc.  When a device behind the router sends a packet, the router re-writes the packet to use the router's IP address as the sender, then transmits onward.  And returning packets are re-written and re-transmitted by the router to the device.  The router keeps a translation table between its actual Internet address, and port, to the local (LAN) destination device and port.  Theoretically, each router could give out an entire Internet's worth of IPv4 addresses, treating them as a private LAN, and doing packet address translation every time a packet enters or leaves the private LAN.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AEaKrq3SpW8", "cid": "UgxAhUbiP7IGQJ9Tikd4AaABAg.8XkNcqRk6Ni8XkbQcovHft", "comment": "Slight correction on the address range, it uses a 16-bit netmask (not 8) and starts at 192.168.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AEaKrq3SpW8", "cid": "UgxAhUbiP7IGQJ9Tikd4AaABAg.8XkNcqRk6Ni8XkgsjKao0v", "comment": "+David Chipman These are specified in RFC1918, which has one of the best names of any technical standard anywhere: \"Address Allocation for Private Internets\".

We \"solved\" this problem by sorting blocks of the address space into non-routable addresses. 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. Then, we use a system called Network Address Translation, or NAT. Basically what NAT allows is for one LAN to not require as many routable IP Addresses. Since we should never see those three address blocks in the wide net, we can assign them to as many machines as we please.  There are lots of ways NAT gets this done, but the quick and dirty explaination is that the NAT Gateway sees a request from a non routable number, and maps a source port of the request to the IP. Say 192.168.1.2 asks to go to dftba.com:80. The NAT will send the request from the public IP, for example 4.5.6.7:2380 to dftba.com:80. When the server at dtfba.com replies back it will answer to 4.5.6.7:2380. The NAT knows that port 2380 belongs to 192.168.1.2 so it forwards the packet to that computer.   If all that sounds like an ugly horrible hack that is confusing, you are absolutely right, which is why we have IPv6 which allows for trillions of addressable hosts.
