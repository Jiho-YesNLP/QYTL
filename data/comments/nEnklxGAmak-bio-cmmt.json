Early adults, college, boot camp, etc. can cause a break. There may be a genetic predisposition to being sensitive to a lack of folic acid or whatever causes the problem in the second trimester.

There's a better chance of finding candidates for research studies in a facility like this. The prisons are full of people with mental health issues that may have started in childhood.

Parents would have to sign permission to release medical records, and many parents who are having trouble with their kids would gladly sign up for that because they desperately need answers and help.

Is it possible, or has it ever been seen or noted that someone with a sub type of schizophrenia could confuse their own inner monologs and thoughts as \"hearing voices\"?  I had this thought come up once when I was coming down from psilocybin. Somtimes my own inner \"voice\" won't be my own.  Somtimes its my wife, or my grandma, a friend ect. And its not always something I've \"physically\" heard them say either like \"don't forget to take out the trash\" for example. Every husband has probably heard that and can recall it. Well... Somtimes my grandma will just start chatting in my head, but its me, or about what im doing, if tha makes sense. Say at work or whatever. Its not like a constant thing, or a controlled thing. I know its my own inner voice, me. Almost like my head, or mind is attempting to mess with me, or see if I'm paying attention? Idk. I know that sounds out there, but yeah.   I could imagine somone doing that to varying degrees. And if they fed into it, or somthing like that. Ot could lead to all sorts of conclusions or scenarios. Or worse! Somone else feeds it! Crapola!

I know somtimes, Tim leary, Terrance McKenna, and lesser somtimes Allan watts and Alexander Shulgin liked to flirt with the \"thought\" that schizophrenia could have blessings, but clearly and openly stated that those notions are dangerous.  Even though I know that exists, it still surprises me when I hear it.  Another edit- N,N-Dimethltryptamine can be found in the urine of schizophrenic patients. I read that in a paper. Its interesting as all get out to me. The relationship between serotonin and entheogens/psychedelics and other \"drugs\". Im just a layman with it all really. I wanted to follow into psychotherapy, specifically with the treatment of certain psychedelics, but early on I learned that I would never be allowed a license from the DEA.

I thought that i was demonically possesed. I heard songs from taylor swift playing in my head, the blank space song. It was as if the song was meant for me. My delusion started that the singer was singing songs of me, that she was in love with me. During the schizophrenic episode i travelled to space, destroyed a planet and ate a galaxy. It was dark around me and it was cold. I travelled by flying around space and absorbed the space soul around me to gain immortality. The delusions continued as stories that i was the devil and had many girlfriends who i visually hallucinated and it  seemed real. During the next years i came across strangers who looked lile my hallucinations they seemed to notice me but didnt make contact. I thought they were witches who too are immortal and came from countries like japan, russia, south korea, native americans, china, netherlands, united kingdom, germany, kenya and colombia.

The witches were gathering together to give me my shares in these companies. I now realise that it is just a delusion and false but i still remain to the possibility that i could be an immortal.

So. . .what is \"sane\" and \"normal\" start off as \"insane\" and \"crazy\" and \"impossible\".  No, your not being followed or watched or listened to by anyone.  If you think so your delusional.  Jesus had followers.  Was he delusional?  You know whats crazy . . .that millions of people believe a construction worker from the 1st century is going to come back from the dead and take all those that agree with him to a special place and everyonr else will suffer forever because they did not agree he was his own biological parent amongs other strange ideas.  He even asked you to symbolize eating his flesh and drinking his blood every week for the rest of your life to be in his favor.  That is somewhat psychotic and cannabilistic.  If you dont accept it you will suffer in the worst pain imaginable for eternity.  And millions believe a 30.year-old jewish construction worker understands them and died for them so they can be born a second time and everything forgotten.  Yeah . ...thats also schizophrenic.

I do have to sort out some of my feelings on the matter, it's true, but as someone who would certainly fit the DSM criteria for schizophrenia, but who favors a Jungian view of Schizophrenia as a process (which he referred to as \"doing a schizophrenia\"), I have to take issue with the view expressed that \"schizophrenia has no hidden blessings.\" The only legitimate proof you need that this is an invalid statement is the word of a \"suffering\" schizophrenic who says, \"Yeah, there are parts of this that I enjoy.\"  I appreciate the need to understand a disease objectively and that Sapolsky's priorities clearly lie along such pragmatic lines and I appreciate why the world needs people who look at things that way. However, the invalidating of the lived experience of the patient is where I am drawing the line here.  I don't care how \"objectively\" you can demonstrate that the schizophrenic's opinion about their disease is likely actually symptom of the disease; that is a moot point which doesn't do as much to discredit the perception as Sapolsky is (very arrogantly) concluding here. That lived experience is an important part of the equation.  When I hear people talk about schizophrenia in such start terms, I am reminded of a psychiatrist I once had who quickly put me on meds to bipolar disorder, and overmedicated a whole ward full of patients, then admitted on family night that he does what he does because he had a mentally ill brother.  I wonder if his mentally ill brother made it harder for him to pursue his academic goals? I wonder if the meds kept his brother nice and quiet, pliant, and out of the way?  I wonder: Do we over-pathologize conditions such as these because they are inconvenient to us and our priorities?  What other reason would we have for deciding that schizophrenics must simply be wrong about how THEY THEMSELVES FEEL? I think the people who really need help here are the friends and family of schizophrenics who are clueless about how to connect with the person they claim to love.

They are grooming young impressionable minds to close off and shut down the absolute possibility of the spirit realm that is acknowledged by every nation, culture and belief systems. This is the same mentality that excused the Nazi's when they experimented and treated with contempt those who were practicing or were born into a belief system that \"hears\" from the spirit world. To say Christians who hear from God are schizophrenic because they say they hear the voice of the One whom they pray to without including psychics who hear from the spirit world as well as practitioners of witchcraft, spiritism and shamanism is pure \"religious\" character assassination and classic persecution against those who have a faith in their God.

I mean look at some of the artists and famous personalities nowadays like Elton John or Lady Gaga. Maybe she was just ahead of her time! She passed away over two decades ago at the age of 65, never cured or finding peace or stability. She led a tragic life. I always felt psychiatry had profited from her illness and never offered any real help for her. It let us down. Looking back and recently learning things about my own diet and gut, I really believe she had gut issues and it affected her brain chemistry in some way. I also believe she had sleep deprivation because of her gut issues and sleep deprivation caused her to be in an altered state of mind, as though she were asleep while awake, living in a dream like state. She eventually had a bladder suspension operation in her 40's and then a colostomy in her 50's. I wish psychiatry would do research and extensive study on the gut's influence on mental health. Her years of struggle and treatment completely ignored this. I really think they will find a great connection.

And that he feels that ch. 14, STRESS & DEPRESSION, in the Zebras book \"will tell all the same stuff in much better, more clear terms, I say proving my point. And what you should do is read it with as much attention to it as if it has been a lecture subject. It is an important subject. Enough hints. OK, so check that one out.\" It is obvious that the hint means that depression is going to figure in the exam. In fact depression is one of Prof. Sapolsky's favorite subjects. He did give a full lecture on it at another time, on Nov. 10, 2009, in the Stanford classroom. It lasts only 52' 28\". He's also given other lectures on depression off campus, also recorded and available on YouTube. This proves a point I took pains to elaborate for his attention. That all the topics developed in each of the 18 chapters of the Zebras book are equally important, not just to Stanford students taking his course, but to the majority of common people trying to go through the daily challenges of life.The Zebras book brings modern neurological science to bear on the key parameters of biological and social existence: stress, as foremost, but of course. But also hormones, heart health, eating  and food, sex and babies, pain, memory, sleep, aging and death, and the immense role of psychology, the powers of depression and personality, the temptations of pleasure and addiction, the role of one's rank and place in society, and how to deal the best we can with all those challenges, pressures and other calamities of modern living. Many of us have bought the Zebras book, which still now is the 3d edition dating to 2004. We bought it in the hope to find in it a kind of guide to understand the baffling complexities of life and ways to better cope with them. To our innate tendency to live more at the level of rapid reactions to the emotions emerging from our limbic system, it adds the calming and reasoning dimension provided by the reflective knowledge and experience of a frontal cortex patiently informed by modern neurobiology . Since then, in the nearly 20 years of progress of neurobiology research, many questions left open in 2004 have received valuable clarifications and refinements. So the suggestion cannot be dismissed that it would be of tremendous value to all of us, ordinary people, if Prof. Sapolsky devoted some of his attention to revising and enlarging the Zebras book into a 4th edition, dated, say, 2024.  Prof. Sapolsky is now retired from active teaching, as a prof. emeritus. He has at his disposal a number of young graduate assistants who would be eager to assist him in assembling all the relevant new research as his documentation for this revision. And he is, naturally, the best placed to undertake this revised edition. The problem of course is, as in many challenges, personality. Our Incredibly Learned Professor has vast curiosity. He mentioned many times that he eventually realized that his youthful enthusiasm for stress, glucocorticoids, and the functions of the hippocampus and the amygdala has been succeeded during his mature years by a no less enthusiastic interest in the working of the frontal cortex,. This should have been his lifelong subject of research, had he only known better when he started off in his career as a scientist. In reality, the  constant, deep interest of Prof. Sapolsky \u2014 the one that drives so visibly through all the other books he's written before and after the Zebras book, and his sundry articles in scientific journals \u2014 has always been the impact on human behavior of the workings of the brain, in their positive and negative aspects. This encyclopedic inclination came to a complete expression in his monumental masterpiece BEHAVE, THE BIOLOGY OF HUMANS at OUR BEST and WORST. Having reached that intoxicating stage of global vision and wisdom, it may be less fun for the research enthusiast that Prof. Sapolsky still is towards the end of is career to revisit the topics of his younger age, when so much new, exciting stuff is happening all the time in brain research. However Prof. Sapolsky is at bottom \u2014 as is clear to whoever cares to read his previous books and pay attention to his comments in lectures \u2014 a wishful do-gooder, a scientist with a strong moralizing streak. Through his research, his lectures, his books, he hopes to have promoted an incentive towards the common good thanks to the enlightening impact of modern neuroscience. This is extremely clear from the topics ending the big book BEHAVE: the tendency of dividing people in US versus THEM, and its potential to generate conflict and wars; the complexities of rank and hierarchy, with their effects on mental balance and social consequences; defining the \"right thing\" to do if you can; etc. \u2014 all these themes expanding into vast reviews of morality, the role of empathy in human connections, the incredible power of language through its metaphors, the ambition to reform the criminal justice system, and so on. Prof. Sapolsky is flying high in those elevated subjects of Human Nature. His book wants to continue in the encyclopedic vein of Lucretius' DE NATURA RERUM, and Baron d'Holbach's SYSTEME DE LA NATURE. With this difference that Prof. Sapolsky sees the access to \"Human Nature\" through neuroscience and the workings of the brain. It's going to be pretty hard to bring Prof. Sapolsky back down to the narrower confines of the effects of Stress in everyday life, and the drudgery of revising the Zebras book. Still, there's hope if he should come to realize that his own effective contribution to the common good of the world in the concrete present is as well served, if not better, in giving us a refreshed version of his fundamental guide on Stress, as in his laudable high-flying reflections on the grand problems of society and mankind.

Likewise, the lack of dopamine leading to parkinson's would follow from a a lack of protection against ferroptosis, and brain cell death is indeed what causes Parkinson's. It is also typical to find increased iron in the substantia nigra of deceased Parkinson's patients.  \"Dopaminergic\u00a0neurons\u00a0are found in a 'harsh' region of the\u00a0brain, the\u00a0substantia\u00a0nigra pars compacta, which is DA-rich and contains both redox available neuromelanin and a high iron content.\" Dopaminergic neurons, 2005  So not only is the substantia nigra the center of dopamine production in the brain, it also normally already has a high iron concentration, so it would be especially sensitive to iron induced cell death/ferroptosis.  Seems like a pretty solid hypothesis to me: iron excess deposition first manifests in substantia nigra, which responds with more dopamine to protect these essential neurons, which then leads to schizophrenia (which according to this talk is pretty ironclad tied to dopamine excess, given you can induce schizophrenia by too much dopamine).  Regarding the early onset of schizophrenia, it makes sense in the context of iron accumulation taking time (so it's not kids very often), while also one can imagine more iron being deposited during developing brain tissue, than after the brain is fully formed since there is very low cell turnover.  (Regarding the connection with viral stress and other infections, this is known to cause abnormally high iron deposition in the inflamed regions, if overall body/macrophage iron stores are too high)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "nEnklxGAmak", "cid": "UgwdN5hAGY6j0S1V2X94AaABAg", "comment": "Look, it's a human Wikipedia.

Speaking of alternatives to dopamine to protect against ferroptosis: piracetam is known to improve aspiration and ATP production of mitochondria, and used in Alzheimer's. But if a cell is in danger of ferroptosis, it should mean it already has at least uncoupled mitochondrial respiration to a significant degree to protect against ROS. So if piracetam can allow a brain cell to aspirate normally again, it must also indirectly protect against ferroptosis, apparently by protecting against ROS as indicated in some papers.  Long story short, piracetam should allow the body to reduce dopamine production thereby lessening symptoms (my theory, not the paper's below)  \"Conclusion:\u00a0Piracetam, a member of the nootropic class of drugs and a positive modulator of glutamate receptor, may be of therapeutic benefit in treating schizophrenic patients in combination with typical neuroleptics.

As someone who had Schizophrenia (yes you read right i got rid of it) The so called hallucinations or foreign signals are just that foreign signals. I find the not mentioning of the candida overgrowth that is nurtured with gluten, sugar, processed foods, antibiotics artificial sweeteners, additives in cigarettes', obviously beer, glysophate and what ever else the food industry has come up with to kill your useful bacteria (gut biome) quite lacking in information. All the things ull find in a non organic store (especially Monsanto products) contribute to this and will have wrecked your gut lining by the age of 20 by creating huge holes in them allowing many particles to pass that aren't supposed to. This creates auto immune, food allergy's, Alzheimer, brain fog... basically most of all disease including candida getting out of its helpful position in you gut to spreading through you whole body. The nervous system evolved from fungi thus it is neither hard to figure out or to believe that the fungus will interject into each and every one of you cells and place little root structures inside them. Also most of your serotonin is created in your gut the fungus will freely use it (in a parasitic way) to modulate you to consume and need to consume any and all things that contain sugar, it will cause you to hyperventilate since it needs oxygen, it will modulate you to do any and all things that will suppress you immune system (especially anything that stresses you will deactivate you immune system due to the deactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system (shouldn't this be ur specialty subject...))  so it can prosper while you don't. This means you are not getting any of the nutrients, vitamins and so on the list is too long to type, that you need because good bacteria in your gut produce most of this stuff and the candida will not.

It's not a normal serum copper test, but one that will measure the amount of toxic free copper in the blood. A fast and safe way to lower free copper is with allopurinol, a uric acid lowering drug. It also chelates copper. Google \"allopurinol for schizophrenia\" and there are alot of articles showing it works. Your mother also needs to take 50 mg pf zinc, one hour before meals, 3 times per day. The zinc will block copper absorption contained in food. She could add alopurinol to the meds she's already taking, then once the free copper is lowered in a few months to 6 months, her symptoms will go away, and she can start weaning off the anti psychotic meds.

I get very frustrated when people think that a daughter can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, dedicate her life to taking care of her mother who needs live-in help. So I apologize for coming across as super defensive and accusatory. If my son was still alive I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to live with and care for her like I do. My life is far from \u201cnormal\u201d and losing my son made me a completely different person. One who has more empathy, compassion, and patience. That\u2019s why I am not only ok with dedicating my life to my mother, but also feeling no negative emotions towards the subject. But I will say that what you said in an earlier response a few months ago about how it would be almost impossible for my mother to be my best friend- is very true for most people. But I\u2019ve had things happen in this life that changed me profoundly and changed me into someone who is far from the normal and happy person I used to be. So your opinion on the matter is valid for most situations. Just not for mine.    I also have a tendency to see things through the lens of my own personal experiences and base my opinions on my own biased beliefs.. and I need to try and stop doing that because every person who suffers with schizophrenia is not the same by any means. I will try to word my comments and replies in a way that makes it clear that the only experience I have with schizophrenia is my mother\u2019s fight against it. I can sometimes make blanket statements about how schizophrenic individuals aren\u2019t violent, but it is reckless for me to say that. Just because my mother has never shown any \u201cbad\u201d violent behavior doesn\u2019t mean that others are the same.   I also apologize for coming across defensively about your earlier reply to someone else about how I\u2019m a bot because of how I look in my picture. I am going to change my photo because I think it may help people focus more on my words.    Thank you for understanding that schizophrenia can be hard to talk about because it effects so many people and their loved ones and it is an all consuming thing that not only the person with the disease deals with nonstop, but also the family members as well. No one should be treated like a lesser person because of a disease that they certainly did not choose to suffer from.    My mother is my best friend and my guardian angel all rolled into one amazing human being. And I constantly see society treat her as a monster as soon as they find out she suffers from schizophrenia. Yet she still gets up every day with a smile on her face and does her best to face the world and not let her disease take away anymore than it already has. Seeing her struggle and seeing her never give up and never give in, no matter what, is nothing short of a miracle.   I hope life treats you well, and I hope you can forgive my hostile responses.

It breaks my heart to think about you and the loss of your brother. As much as we don\u2019t want to say it, love can only go so far. I live in solitude with my mother and my view of her symptoms are not unbiased. What I consider to be a \u201cgood day\u201d or \u201cbad day\u201d is not something that can be appropriately described with only words. Compared to others, her day to day functioning and communication would be viewed on a different scale. I can only compare her symptoms and \u201cepisodes\u201d to her previous ones. An outsider may think her good days are horrifying\u2026but we all see things differently. What I see and live with has become our \u201cnormal\u201d. It is not sunshine and roses by any means. But because we have tailored our life to fit her needs, and have more control on outside influences, we have created an existence that allows her to function as well as she can, factoring in her day to day distractions.   I know that molding my life into a safety net for her is probably not the best idea in the long run. Sometimes I think I\u2019m a selfish daughter for catering my entire existence to fit her wants and needs\u2026because I\u2019m the one who it all rests upon. What kind of daughter am I really for building this glass bubble around us? What happens to her if I randomly get hit by a car or fall over dead one day? What happens to her when I\u2019m not here to keep things the way they are? She will be at the mercy of this cruel world that has no regard for individuals who suffer from an all consuming mental illness like hers. Of course she\u2019ll have money, she gets everything I have. But what if she can\u2019t adjust and adapt? That is my worst fear.  But that\u2019s the way life is. And to see her functioning as best she can, and see her as happy as an individual with her affliction can be, makes me keep going. She has schizophrenia\u2026she\u2019s not what the world sees as \u201cnormal\u201d. She has horrific days, and terrible nights\u2026but they are not as bad as they could be, because I do my best to shield her from anything that would make things worse. Medication, therapy, set schedules, outdoor activities, no outside influences that effect her negatively, immense patience, and love. That\u2019s what keeps her going and that\u2019s what I will do. I buried my son. And it killed me. And even though I may be selfish, I need her as much as she needs me.   I\u2019m so sorry that you lost your child. There is no getting over that. No one should ever have to bury their child. Life is cruel and all we can do is max out the good times and live in the good moments. Because there\u2019s no stopping the clock.

My young son died almost 10 years ago and I spent a long time in a very dark, lonely, and awful headspace. I considered, and even attempted, taking my own life 3 months after his death. My mother was the one and only person who truly stuck by my side and held me when I would spend the entire night crying and screaming at God for taking my son from me. I eventually started hating my ex husband simply because my son looked just like him, and I could t even look my husband in the eye without feeling hate towards him. Hating the fact that I had to look at him and feel that longing sadness constantly. I eventually pushed everyone in my life away because I genuinely hated every single person I knew.   The only person who stayed the course with me was my mother. She still stands beside me and loves me unconditionally. Even though she struggles with mental illness, she always tries her best to be supportive to me. And that truly amazes me. Her grace, love, and warm soul are rare in this world.   She held me up when I couldn\u2019t stand. So I will hold her up and walk through this life with her, no matter the circumstances. She deserves a happy and peaceful life. So I try to make that possible for her.   We have bad days of course\u2026but we also have wonderful days. And I will never allow the bad to overcome the good in our lives.

I guess we thought of he stopped doing the drugs and alcohol the delusions would go away... And they do get better most of the time, but they don't go away, he's just not as paranoid, so maybe they're easier to manage for him. Anyway, his biggest delusion is that I am trying to kill him. He runs from state to state, because he believes so deeply that I'm trying to kill him. I live 1000 miles away from him now, don't know what state he's in, his number. I have tried to cut all ties with him. He's been on the streets the last 2 years, and he's recently asked my mother if he can move in with her. He misses family, and wants to be near his family. The thing is, I'm my mom's next door neighbor. He knows that. He's never believed he's having any delusions, he absolutely knows I'm living in his walls, following him on the streets, I've been in jail with him, I've gotten him fired from his jobs, I've put cameras in his house, these are things he absolutely believes, and is terrified that I'm going to kill him. He has admitted himself into psych wards, but he's out of there as soon as they mention he's probably schizophrenic. He won't seek medical care. Now I'm scared to have him living next door to my family. My biggest fear is he gets so paranoid that I'm trying to kill him, he comes and kills me one day.... My brother has never shown any signs of aggression towards me, he's scared of me. However, he does end up in fights with people on the streets, I know this because that's what he's usually put in jail for, fighting someone he works with, plays with, lives with, or does drugs with. I love my brother. I want a relationship with him, but I've given up because he's so out there. I don't want him to move next to us unless he's medicated and with a therapist or whatever type of doctor deals with this. Am I being irrational?

The word \u201cschizo\u201d has been thrown around haphazardly, incorrectly, and inappropriately at times by society. There are different forms of schizophrenic type disorders.    I think what causes the fear in people is just that, the fear. The fear in non schizophrenic affected individuals being afraid of the affected doing something violent. It\u2019s also the schizophrenic\u2019s atypical behavior. Their behavior scares people and they end up ostracizing them. If they have delusions and hallucinations, that can be extremely jarring for people. It\u2019s like people go into fight or flight mode. When they hear someone is seeing or hearing things that aren\u2019t there, their reaction 99% of the time will be to run away. We do similar things to and have similar reactions to socially awkward people also. It isn\u2019t right of course but it\u2019s understandable.
