I'm not talking about Religion, I'm very aware of the shared traumas we in our Western/Globalized society received from Baby boomer religious dogma and toxicity. you brough up religion and your grievances and mockery is valid. But IF God equals Truth, then could you not call yourself a follower of the Truth? What's absurd about THAT? I believe everyone has to regard something as sacrosanct, even if its just oneself.
