When we are talking about the intensity of sound at a distance R, we take 4\u03c0r\u00b2 as area, because that is the amount of intensity present at that distance, but when it is about receiving energy as in case of eardrum, we need to consider the area of the eardrum as the intensity perceived by every body at a particular distance is not constant, but it's area dependent.
