Here's the full proof and the explanation.  The SPACE that surrounds us IS quantum gravitational (ON/IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great.  Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS \u201cmass\u201d/energy is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Great.  To answer the question: \u201cWhat is nothing in accordance with physics (AND TIME)?\u201d, we must understand (ON BALANCE) WHAT IS SOMETHING; AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. The ultimate unification and understanding of physics/physical experience (AND TIME) combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites. Carefully consider what is THE EYE (ON BALANCE). Do notice the associated black \u201cspace\u201d AND the dome AS WELL. NOW, carefully consider what follows !!!! The following proves what is the fourth dimension ON BALANCE.  WHAT IS E=MC2 is the fundamental basis for the true understanding of what is inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE !!!! (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE.) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2, c squared CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. INDEED, consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE; AS two AND three dimensional SPACE are, in fact, BALANCED !!!! Great. What is gravity is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked. Consider what is the ORANGE AND setting SUN. Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) MOON. It is the same size as what is THE EYE. Notice what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Indeed, consider complete combustion !!!! (I have mathematically proven the fourth dimension.) The density of what is pure WATER IS HALF of that of what is packed sand/wet packed sand. Now, WHAT IS THE EARTH IS ALSO BLUE !!!! The rotation of WHAT IS \u201cTHE MOON\u201d matches the revolution, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked (AND BALANCED) opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, I have solved WHAT IS the coronal heating \u201cproblem\u201d. GREAT. (Indeed, consider what is lightning.)  Absolute SPACE IS the truly and fundamentally BALANCED inertial frame (or SPACE). Indeed, \u201cmass\u201d/ENERGY is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE (ON BALANCE) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS this proves what is the FOURTH dimension. Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Great !!!! Think. The fourth dimension AND WHAT IS E=MC2 are FUNDAMENTALLY consistent with/AS what are wave/particle duality AND the fact that c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE (REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE !!!! INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS \u201cmass\u201d/ENERGY is (CLEARLY) electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), I have mathematically proven and explained what is the FOURTH dimension; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AND consider what is complete combustion (ON BALANCE); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Great. It is proven. Finally, ON BALANCE, notice WHAT IS the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Magnificent !!!! Think. It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!! Notice WHAT IS \u201cTHE MOON\u201d (ON BALANCE) !!!! THINK !!!! ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT !!!! CONSIDER TIME AND TIME DILATION ON BALANCE !!!! GREAT !!!! AGAIN, do notice WHAT IS the ORANGE \u201cSUN\u201d ON BALANCE !!!! Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE.

What you are measuring is the resultant wave of multiple waves interfering with one another. Light is not a particle. It is a spherical wave front that  hits electrons in a reflective material at different times. When that sphere first hits the surface, those  first electrons begin to vibrate at the same frequency as that light. Vibrating charges create new wavefronts. As the original wavefronts continues on, more and more electrons begin to vibrate and they all create their own wave fronts. Where they constructively interfere, you get the reflected light. That\u2019s also why reflected light is polarized parallel to the surface of reflection. Those valence electrons are in the conductive band which limits their vibrations along the plane of the material surface.  When a light \u201crefracts,\u201d it is passing between the molecules in a transparent material. This has the effect of a diffraction grating causing more and more spherical wavefronts to interfere with each other which the \u201crefracted\u201d ray being the resultant wave appearing at a different angle than the incident \u201cray.\u201d  Just wanted to toss that out there if anybody is interested in quantum mechanics and would rather not have to unlearn a basic approximate explanation.
