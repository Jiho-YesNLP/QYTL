When I looked at bullying, I felt upset: Yes, I was disturbed that it felt bad for the victim, but mostly I had this strong feeling that the bully is breaking the moral code. What I told them when I interrupted the bullying was something along the lines of \"You're not supposed to do that. How can you do that. It's such an ugly thing to do. I can't fathom how you derive joy from doing such an ugly thing.\" Which I truly didn't understand. When I was an even smaller kid, younger than I can recall, I was with my dad and we witnessed the people in a parked car toss their ice cream wrappers out the window. I got up, picked up the wrappers, and threw them back inside. My dad wasnt sure of my reasoning, and I sure as hell dont remember what I was thinking. But that, along with my later experiences, make me thinkg that my seemingly \"brave\" actions was me actually breaking moral code-  not caring what others were thinking, not doing the socially sophisticated move of \"keeping tabs\" on how much effort everyone else was putting in. I was playing the social game as good as I could: according to rigid, simple rules. It's become intuition now, and for instance when I walk through a weighted public door, I'll always check if there's someone behind me who's walking a bike, and if they are, I'll always stay and hold it - because it's THAT cumbersome to try to puch it open while you're also holding your bike. No one told me to do it, it just makes sense if you do the utility math. Most others dont, and though it makes me angry, I think I'll keep doing it. I guess this is different though.

In my 20s I was tracked everywhere I went and they did something I found was called anxiety pacing to torture me. I learned hypnosis to make some friends but it wasn't enough to undo the damage. I was in an underground group of former drinkers to try and change my life for good. They tortured me for some reason. I learned enough to start noticing their speech patterns so for the 2nd half of my time there I learned about their techniques. One day I was in downtown city, got hit in the face with a bat. I went in for surgery. Later I found out there was a consciousness monitoring device put in my brain that let's them track me and my thoughts. I was tortured by these people every day starting about 3 years ago. I wish it to be untrue but it has been confirmed. Now I'm being tortured still morning noon and night. they look into my mind. I'm unable to keep a thought from being observed.

What recent, high quality studies have shown again and again is that poverty does not cause violence, but it are big differences in socio-economic status along with low cognitive ability.

We know that our body can fix damage when we get hurt, but we can not regrow a leg, arm, finger. Nails would regrow only if the root is still present.  Here is an example of amazing plasticity: When a nerve bundle get damaged by a deep cut in the arm or leg, a few thousand or million of neurons get the axon destroyed locally.   The repair consist in restarting to grow an axon, starting from the neuron body, where the nucleus is located, somewhere in the spinal chord. The axon keep growing, following the path of the dead axon. Finally, when a sufficient large number of axon reach the muscle, recreate the dendrite and grow one new synapse for each muscle cell, this is when the muscle regain more and more strength.  The repair also happen in the opposite direction, starting from a heat/touch sensor in the skin and growing the axon back until reaching the spinal chord.  The cerebellum is a multipurpose associative array. If there would be an incorrect rewiring of neuron after injury, it can provide a logical address translation between the motor command and the actual muscle fiber.  The first few years after birth, there is a lot of hesitation and try/error to discover which muscle move when a command is desired. The cerebellum build a map of muscle command versus actual muscle fiber.  The cerebellum is actually constantly adjusting the PID loop to take account of muscle losing responsiveness as it get used or abused. Similar to the classic control theory, the cerebellum adjust the power required to make a fast motion with a smooth declaration when reaching the target position and a firm stop, not allowing overshoot.  Another function is to alternate constantly the exact fiber to contract in order to keep a position as well as allow to control precisely the power level required for smooth motion.. As individual muscle cells get depleted, the cerebellum select other muscle cell and let other relax, repeating the cycle constantly so that the entire group of muscle cells get used uniformly.  The neocortex is actually the only real plastic part of the brain. It is composed of approximately 4 million column of 4, 5 or 6 layers of neurons.  The columns have tendency to acquire functions related to the closest specialized area. So, the columns in the back of the head will perform high level image processing. Those is the frontal lobe will participate in the construction of complex sequential operations.  If a large portion of the frontal lobe would get damaged, there would be little chance that columns located far away could replace their functionality.  Brief, plasticity is possible since our brain is learning all the time. Each time we focus our attention on something, when we become conscious of a specific object (sound, image, abstract though, etc), we are creating redundant copy of that memory.  The reason that we remember a birthday in childhood like if it was yesterday, it is precisely because we were thinking about it yesterday and have a fresh new copy of the event.  Each time we talk to somebody, we describe who we meet, what we bought, etc, we are making a copy of that story.  Consciousness is exactly equal to formation of memory. We are conscious of the concepts that we are trying to think about and we are making redundant memory of every detail that are brought to our attention.  Conversely, those days where we feel sick and can barely get up to eat and we forget who we talked and what we did. A few weeks later, trying to find when and where we were, we may feel the strange sensation that there is a gap, like if nothing happened in this time period. This lack of information is effectively a sign of lower conscious level.  Consciousness depend not only on our attention level (being awake, not sleeping, not in coma) but also on the warm feeling of control on our live because we can remember what we did everyday in the past, for our entire life. If I see something shocking for me, for example, somebody drive over a red light, I can feel indignation because I know that I never did such thing... except maybe on a very few exceptions which I feel that I can justify. The shock comes from the fact that I resist to the urge, I beat myself internally when waiting on a red light, so why other people would cheat and run the red light and risk to create an accident.  I remember, driving in England, that I waited accidentally on a green light, looking on a map. It was in the middle of the night, no car around. The light turned red and stayed red forever. I knew it was because of the metal detector which was designed to trigger the green light only one a change. I waited anyway, curious to see if a timer would finally trigger the light.  After 15 minutes, I was angry at the engineers who did not cover the case of a metal detector stuck in the \"on\" level. Particularly at night with no risk to affect traffic, how difficult was it to revert to a fixed timer and ignore the metal detector. When cycling thru timer, if a metal detector suddenly becomes \"off\", the software could record this has \"clever use of timer to free a car from red light\". It could then safely revert to the metal detector only, no timer, for maximum efficiency.  Brief, I had to go on that red light. I was also worrying that a police could be hidden during all that time, waiting until I run the red light. This would be an unfair trap, an excellent way to get money from drivers who are not inclined to run the red light.  Even if we claim that \"we don't judge\", it just mean that we are not the kind of people to gossip and report to everybody the tiniest detail about how this person dress, with who they are talking. We avoid playing the snitch, but we still compare the behaviors of everybody to our own ; what would I do if I was in his/her situation.", "votes": "9", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "EtVfoIkVSu8", "cid": "Ugjyrvic1nYvIHgCoAEC.8DdmkNMohUV8SmzcLPzcl9", "comment": "In previous lectures it was stated that if you had a frontal cortex removed or damaged that you would lose the ability to learn to behave properly.

What he was talking about was almost complete ablation of the prefrontal cortex.
