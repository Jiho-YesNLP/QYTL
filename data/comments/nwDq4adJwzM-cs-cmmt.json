Like instead of just giving into the fact there are so many bad people in the world, its easier to just think, oh, its (insert demographic) that's the problem. Also my god, the American media is very much to blame. Nothing too wrong with being judgemental, just a shame people would rather resort to judge people on their race or culture instead of their character as an individual. The world isn't so simple that just being of a race can define all of the people in it, which is way racism is largely idiotic, but there's something about the American people that just consistently has them focus on race, likely because its easy and simple to resort to racism and hard to think of everyone is a nuanced person, especially in a country of so many people of so many nationalities. Racism is like an ugly stain on America that likely cannot be rubbed out, and as long as the human qualities of aggression and ignorance live on, I don't know that your country will ever be able to wash out the rather ugly stain that is American racism, but tbh if you want to know where it comes from just look at American history and media, its pretty clear that the seeds of racism were planted very long ago", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nwDq4adJwzM", "cid": "Ugjjt1ZS29LyBXgCoAEC.8S6lK61umkQ8S87m7vSbzc", "comment": "\u201csubconsciously racists\u201d  Got some evidence to back that up?", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nwDq4adJwzM", "cid": "Ugjjt1ZS29LyBXgCoAEC.8S6lK61umkQ8S8ZV7Jyj4-", "comment": "It is not only the USA.
