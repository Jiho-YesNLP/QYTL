The person who taught us didn't even tell us why we were doing what we were doing. The whole determinant thing is delivered so beautifully and also his information can be directly used in robotics or regression or coding in general because he presents it so nicely. No teacher has ever explained determinants like this ever, they simply gave the formula and that is it. The problem sets seemed theoretical but I didn't really think they were unsolvable. He cannot teach how to solve each problem in class but the essence of linear algebra is captured very well here especially if you need to use this to code.
