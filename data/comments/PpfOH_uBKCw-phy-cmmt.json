We know have two simultaneous equations: I1 * R1 = I2 * R2 .................... (i) I(total) = I1 + I2 ..................... (ii)   If you sustitute I1, you get the formula to find I2: I2 = I(total) [(R1)/(R1 +R2)]   If you sustitute I2, you get the formula to find I1:  I1 = I(total) [(R2)/(R1 +R2)]   Hope this helps!", "votes": "199", "replies": "14", "reply": false}, {"vid": "PpfOH_uBKCw", "cid": "Ugy3gKYhOHsSAEYkN7l4AaABAg", "comment": "Topics which you study in university we study it in 11th grade in India", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "PpfOH_uBKCw", "cid": "Ugxds0w6sBIqk43u_Lh4AaABAg", "comment": "So anyway...I have this \u201cself-teaching\u201d pdf on electronics and it complicates this WAY too much on the basic level....\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d to you!
