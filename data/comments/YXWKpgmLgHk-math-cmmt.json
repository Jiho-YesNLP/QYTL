That is, a relationship that gives exclusively one output for any given input.  As an example, the equation of a circle is a non-function.  x^2 + y^2 = R^2, where R is a constant indicating the radius.   There is a positive half of the circle, and a negative half of the circle.  You can re-write it as y=sqrt(r^2 - x^2), but that will not make it a function.  Only one half of the circle can pass the vertical line test, when sqrt assumes the positive root, aka the principle root.   The full circle fails the vertical line test, and is not considered a function.  The horizontal line test, is to determine whether a function's inverse also qualifies as a function.  A function that passes the horizontal line test is called a one-to-one function.  Meaning no individual output of the function is ever duplicated.  Consider y=x^2, and y=2^x as two examples.   For y=x^2, there are two possible values of x that can make y equal 4, which are -2 and +2.  This function passes the vertical line test, but fails the horizontal line test.  It is a function, but not a one-to-one function.    Moving on to y=2^x.   For all real number inputs, there is a unique output of this function that never occurs more than once.   All vertical lines only intersect it once, and all horizontal lines only intersect it once.  You can find an inverse function for it, which is y = log(x)/log(2).   The inverse function has a restricted domain of x>0, because the original function never returns a negative value for a real number input.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "YXWKpgmLgHk", "cid": "UgwRWUpNS-gt-kDn8b54AaABAg.8eh6dbYjCxq8ehUus0UtOk", "comment": "so the inverse cosine of zero is asking what angle gives a cosine of zero. 90 degrees has a cosine of zero, so the inverse cosine of zero is 90 degrees.", "votes": "6", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "YXWKpgmLgHk", "cid": "UgwRWUpNS-gt-kDn8b54AaABAg.8eh6dbYjCxq9om7HK_ZwkQ", "comment": "Here is the proof Let cos^-1(0)=Q 0=cosQ Q=90\u00b0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "YXWKpgmLgHk", "cid": "UgzFZ32E-resm-mpkg54AaABAg.8bZBboSnv278bZa6RSUeDj", "comment": "don't worry buddy i'll be getting to calculus very soon. but by the way the derivative of sin x is cos x.", "votes": "7", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "YXWKpgmLgHk", "cid": "UgzFZ32E-resm-mpkg54AaABAg.8bZBboSnv279-5f18ynsSa", "comment": "No, that\u2019s the derivative of arcsin(x).", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
