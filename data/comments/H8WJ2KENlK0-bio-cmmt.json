structural compounds that store energy: cellulose, indigestible\r Starch: plants way of storing glucose: like amylose (is like cellulose)\r \r Humans way of storing energy:\r Glycogen: short term

more hydrogen bonds, non-saturated if there are more carbon bonds)\r Trans fats: unnatural and dangerous, unsaturated with straight carbon bonds instead of bent ones\r Omega 3: unsaturated fatty acids\r \r Phospho-lipid: Cell membrane walls are made of : 2 fatty acids and a phosphate connected a glyceral , one side hydrophilic (polar side) and the other hydrophobic (non-polar side) so when in

Take a peek inside my notebook :)  Life depends on biological compounds. Compounds include  -carbohydrates, which contain chains of carbon and hydrogen with covalent bonds between each other. Carbohydrates include sugars, such as glucose and fructose. Humans store carbohydrate energy in glycogen.  -lipids, also known as fats. A lipid cannot dissolve in water. Lipids can exist as fatty acids, which are saturated with hydrogen when all carbon atoms contain single bonds with each other, or as a phospholipid, which contains a phosphate group, a nonpolar hydrophobic end, and a polar hydrophilic end; phospholipids make up the structure of cell walls. Lipids also include steroids, which contain four interconnected carbon rings and from which compounds like cholesterol form, and lipid hormones.  -proteins, including enzymes which regulate chemical reactions, antibodies which fight pathogens, and endorphins which create emotion.  -amino acids, which contain an amino group (-NH2) on one end and a carboxyl group (HOOC-) on its other, as well as a carbon in between bonded to one of 20 different groups. Each group produces a unique compound, such as valine or tryptophan. Groups of amino acids connect together to form polypeptides, a type of protein.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "H8WJ2KENlK0", "cid": "Ugxl89AnZ5TVWFZ2LSh4AaABAg", "comment": "These videos are great thanks a lot  Is it strange  im 14 and understand  most of this  Altho I'm autistic", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "H8WJ2KENlK0", "cid": "Ugzupk7LbpxGn092Zgx4AaABAg", "comment": "Peanut butter egg sandwich... that can't be easy to digest.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "H8WJ2KENlK0", "cid": "UgzEbMr4mJq9ni7b44F4AaABAg", "comment": "I'm studying from these vids cause I'm going to sit for an Olevel exam without me ever going to bio class xD", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "H8WJ2KENlK0", "cid": "Ugx1IkRrcurqOeQaRmR4AaABAg", "comment": "Hank your apron is saxy ;)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "H8WJ2KENlK0", "cid": "UgwRjC4J0uNuEYR95E54AaABAg", "comment": "got to fill out a paper using this!\u3000\uff54\uff48\uff41\uff4e\uff4b\uff53\u3000\uff29\u3000\uff47\uff55\uff45\uff53\uff53\uff0e\uff0e\uff0e", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "H8WJ2KENlK0", "cid": "UgxVF21WuCdn1tJrsNB4AaABAg", "comment": "Hey, at 6:43, does Hank mean amylopectin instead of amylose?
