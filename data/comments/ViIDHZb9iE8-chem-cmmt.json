Now back to the reality Na has 3 orbital which has 1 electron in its outermost shell ,which means it has one more shell that of Li. From Coulombs law we can know force of protons are acting parallely on the number of orbitals the atom has and F (inversely propor.) to distace between (proton and electron in this case) .
