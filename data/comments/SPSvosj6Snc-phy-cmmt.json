They should take a course for being a teacher.   2) In todays world, we can reach every material on the internet. So in lectures teacher should not explain the topic. He/she should just answer our questions and students should just study the topics before coming to the class. Lecture time should only be for a Q&A. There should be no attendance. If I don't have any problem I don't attend. That simple.   3) There should be only one midterm and one final. Other assignments should not be graded. So students have less pressure on them.
