In the\u00a0SI\u00a0system, the basic unit of velocity is\u00a0ms. Velocity expressed in\u00a0ms\u00a0provides information about the number of meters travelled by an object in\u00a01\u00a0second of motion.  If a specific direction can be assigned to the motion, then velocity is also a directed (vector) quantity. This means that velocity has: - a direction - the same as the direction of motion - a sense - identifies the side in which the velocity in the specific direction is orientated - a value - the length of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v  Depending on the velocity, the following categories of motion are identified: - uniform motion (constant velocity in time) - non-uniform motion (velocity changing during the motion)  Average velocity  Average velocity\u00a0\u2192vavg\u00a0defines the rate of change of the position vector\u00a0\u0394\u2192r\u00a0in time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0not approaching zero.  It is defined as the ratio of displacement\u00a0\u0394\u2192r\u00a0to time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0in which the displacement took place:  \u2192vavg=\u0394\u2192r\u0394t The direction of the average velocity vector is the same as the direction of the displacement vector.  \ufffc A material point at the initial moment\u00a0t1=0\u00a0was in position\u00a0A. After some time, at moment\u00a0t2=t, it was in position\u00a0B. The displacement of the point is:  \u0394\u2192r=\u2192r2\u2212\u2192r1 The time in which the displacement took place is equal to:  \u0394t=t2\u2212t1=t  Instantaneous velocity  Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of a body in a time interval approaching zero. This is why it is defined as the limit of the quotient of displacement\u00a0\u0394\u2192r\u00a0to time at\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0approaching\u00a00:  \u2192v=limt\u21920\u0394\u2192r\u0394t Differential notation:\u2192v=d\u2192rdt Unlike average velocity, instantaneous velocity detects sudden changes in the movement of a body. For example, the body did not move for 1 second. For another 1 second it moved over a distance of 2 meters. The average velocity during 2 seconds is equal to:  vavg=\u0394r\u0394t=2m2s=1ms Even though the body did not move in the initial phase of the measurement, its average velocity is not equal to zero. If the motion is considered in intervals approaching\u00a00, the initial values of instantaneous velocity are equal to zero.  The direction of the instantaneous velocity vector of the body\u00a0\u2192v\u00a0is the same as the direction of a tangent to the path of the body in the point where the body is located.  \ufffc  Acceleration  Acceleration\u00a0\u2192a\u00a0is a vector physical quantity that expresses the change of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v\u00a0in a set interval\u00a0\u0394t. Thus, it can be said that acceleration defines how fast the velocity of an object changes in time.  If a body moves with constant velocity\u00a0v, its acceleration\u00a0a\u00a0is equal to\u00a00, and the motion of the body is referred to as uniform.  In a straight-line motion, the direction of acceleration is the same as that of velocity. In this type of motion, acceleration only affects changes of velocity: it causes it to increase or decrease (depending on the sense of the acceleration vector).  If the sense of the acceleration vector\u00a0\u2192a\u00a0is the same as the sense of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v, the velocity of the body increases and the motion is referred to as accelerated motion.  \ufffc If the sense of the acceleration vector\u00a0\u2192a\u00a0is opposite to the sense of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v, the velocity of the body decreases and the motion is referred to as decelerated motion. In this case, instead of acceleration, there is deceleration.  \ufffc The unit of acceleration is\u00a0ms2. This results from the following formula:  mss=ms1s=ms2  Acceleration in a curvilinear motion  In a curvilinear motion, the direction of the acceleration vector is at a certain angle to the direction of the velocity vector.  \ufffc In this case, the acceleration vector has two components:  - A component parallel to the velocity vector (tangent to the path and parallel to the direction of motion) \u2014 this is a tangent component\u00a0a||\u00a0that corresponds to the change of the value of velocity.  -A component perpendicular to the velocity vector (perpendicular to the direction of motion) \u2014 this is a normal component\u00a0an\u00a0that corresponds to the change in the direction of the velocity vector. In perpendicular motion, the value of this component is equal to zero.  Average acceleration  Average acceleration of a material point in a set interval of time is the ratio of the increase of the velocity vector\u00a0\u0394\u2192v\u00a0to the time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0in which that increase occurred:  \u2192aavg=\u0394\u2192v\u0394t The direction of the average acceleration vector is the same as the direction of the change of the velocity vector.  \ufffc At the starting moment, a material point\u00a0t1=0\u00a0moved with the velocity of\u00a0v1. After some time, at the moment\u00a0t2=t, its velocity was equal to\u00a0v2. The change of velocity during the motion is equal to:  \u0394\u2192v=\u2192v2\u2212\u2192v1 The time in which the displacement took place is equal to:  \u0394t=t2\u2212t1=t  Instantaneous acceleration  Instantaneous acceleration is acceleration of a body in an interval of time approaching zero. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the quotient of the vector of change of the velocity\u00a0\u0394\u2192v\u00a0and the time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0in which the change occurred:  \u2192a=limt\u21920\u0394\u2192v\u0394t The direction of the instantaneous acceleration vector is the same as the direction of the change of the velocity vector.  \ufffc Differential notation:  \u2192a=d\u2192vdt=d2\u2192rdt2", "votes": "370", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "UgxjrWi-g0qhn3_GVFB4AaABAg", "comment": "talking way to fast", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "Ugy6j-H31IS-YzYsPE14AaABAg", "comment": "how u calcule a cuz 0*7=0 donc a=2*122/7=40.6m/s^2", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "Ugy_dXPVo2TdrRBlVCh4AaABAg", "comment": "Why are you speaking very fast.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "UgzjSFa_133JuMUOBwV4AaABAg", "comment": "1:21 It's 2020 and I'm looking forward to seeing Cthulhu's name on that ballot.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "UgxWtQzk8z0YJAxbUYB4AaABAg", "comment": "there is only one right direction and thats one direction", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "UgzwPxJ4aL6VJk-867x4AaABAg", "comment": "where were these videos when I was in high school? would've helped a ton loL!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "UgwAW8iBnegSjZG5a9F4AaABAg", "comment": "Go to a YouTube channel called, 'Don't Memorise.'

Now that you have gotten that out of there, do pemdas. 1/2(acceleration) converts to its opposite to bring it to the other side where 122 is. It is now 122(2)=244. All you have left on the other side is (acceleration)7^2. Do the opposite and Ladda ladda you have 244/7^2. 7^2 is 49 so it is really 244/49. Whip out a calculator or become a try-hard and do it in your brain and you will get 4.9 which rounds to 5.

This means that velocity has: - a direction - the same as the direction of motion - a sense - identifies the side in which the velocity in the specific direction is orientated - a value - the length of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v  Depending on the velocity, the following categories of motion are identified: - uniform motion (constant velocity in time) - non-uniform motion (velocity changing during the motion)  Average velocity  Average velocity\u00a0\u2192vavg\u00a0defines the rate of change of the position vector\u00a0\u0394\u2192r\u00a0in time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0not approaching zero.  It is defined as the ratio of displacement\u00a0\u0394\u2192r\u00a0to time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0in which the displacement took place:  \u2192vavg=\u0394\u2192r\u0394t The direction of the average velocity vector is the same as the direction of the displacement vector.  \ufffc A material point at the initial moment\u00a0t1=0\u00a0was in position\u00a0A. After some time, at moment\u00a0t2=t, it was in position\u00a0B. The displacement of the point is:  \u0394\u2192r=\u2192r2\u2212\u2192r1 The time in which the displacement took place is equal to:  \u0394t=t2\u2212t1=t  Instantaneous velocity  Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of a body in a time interval approaching zero. This is why it is defined as the limit of the quotient of displacement\u00a0\u0394\u2192r\u00a0to time at\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0approaching\u00a00:  \u2192v=limt\u21920\u0394\u2192r\u0394t Differential notation:\u2192v=d\u2192rdt Unlike average velocity, instantaneous velocity detects sudden changes in the movement of a body. For example, the body did not move for 1 second. For another 1 second it moved over a distance of 2 meters. The average velocity during 2 seconds is equal to:  vavg=\u0394r\u0394t=2m2s=1ms Even though the body did not move in the initial phase of the measurement, its average velocity is not equal to zero. If the motion is considered in intervals approaching\u00a00, the initial values of instantaneous velocity are equal to zero.  The direction of the instantaneous velocity vector of the body\u00a0\u2192v\u00a0is the same as the direction of a tangent to the path of the body in the point where the body is located.  \ufffc  Acceleration  Acceleration\u00a0\u2192a\u00a0is a vector physical quantity that expresses the change of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v\u00a0in a set interval\u00a0\u0394t. Thus, it can be said that acceleration defines how fast the velocity of an object changes in time.  If a body moves with constant velocity\u00a0v, its acceleration\u00a0a\u00a0is equal to\u00a00, and the motion of the body is referred to as uniform.  In a straight-line motion, the direction of acceleration is the same as that of velocity. In this type of motion, acceleration only affects changes of velocity: it causes it to increase or decrease (depending on the sense of the acceleration vector).  If the sense of the acceleration vector\u00a0\u2192a\u00a0is the same as the sense of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v, the velocity of the body increases and the motion is referred to as accelerated motion.  \ufffc If the sense of the acceleration vector\u00a0\u2192a\u00a0is opposite to the sense of the velocity vector\u00a0\u2192v, the velocity of the body decreases and the motion is referred to as decelerated motion. In this case, instead of acceleration, there is deceleration.  \ufffc The unit of acceleration is\u00a0ms2. This results from the following formula:  mss=ms1s=ms2  Acceleration in a curvilinear motion  In a curvilinear motion, the direction of the acceleration vector is at a certain angle to the direction of the velocity vector.  \ufffc In this case, the acceleration vector has two components:  - A component parallel to the velocity vector (tangent to the path and parallel to the direction of motion) \u2014 this is a tangent component\u00a0a||\u00a0that corresponds to the change of the value of velocity.  -A component perpendicular to the velocity vector (perpendicular to the direction of motion) \u2014 this is a normal component\u00a0an\u00a0that corresponds to the change in the direction of the velocity vector. In perpendicular motion, the value of this component is equal to zero.  Average acceleration  Average acceleration of a material point in a set interval of time is the ratio of the increase of the velocity vector\u00a0\u0394\u2192v\u00a0to the time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0in which that increase occurred:  \u2192aavg=\u0394\u2192v\u0394t The direction of the average acceleration vector is the same as the direction of the change of the velocity vector.  \ufffc At the starting moment, a material point\u00a0t1=0\u00a0moved with the velocity of\u00a0v1. After some time, at the moment\u00a0t2=t, its velocity was equal to\u00a0v2. The change of velocity during the motion is equal to:  \u0394\u2192v=\u2192v2\u2212\u2192v1 The time in which the displacement took place is equal to:  \u0394t=t2\u2212t1=t  Instantaneous acceleration  Instantaneous acceleration is acceleration of a body in an interval of time approaching zero. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the quotient of the vector of change of the velocity\u00a0\u0394\u2192v\u00a0and the time\u00a0\u0394t\u00a0in which the change occurred:  \u2192a=limt\u21920\u0394\u2192v\u0394t The direction of the instantaneous acceleration vector is the same as the direction of the change of the velocity vector.  \ufffc Differential notation:  \u2192a=d\u2192vdt=d2\u2192rdt2", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "UgxS7BI4sgnayDqjUo14AaABAg.9-4wq0Ln7VD98bAGKJRGmy", "comment": "me, studying for the AP tomorrow:", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "Ugw9oi_EaUaE_JC7XsZ4AaABAg", "comment": "you would still get a ticket", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ZM8ECpBuQYE", "cid": "Ugxzt4EsGYZkD-Ok5IF4AaABAg", "comment": "Slow down your speed of talking.

Considering that these series are primarily directed towards high school and/or college students who are preparing for their lives and may not be receiving the best education from parents and/or school, a course on personal finance would be incredibly beneficial to your audience. Not enough young people know how to use their money correctly (myself included).   For example, you could cover topics like:   how to write a check, how to plan and organize a budget, how to invest, how to choose a good bank, how to open a bank account, how to go about purchasing a car or a house, or how to choose a good apartment, how to figure out what kind of salary you would need to maintain your current or preferred lifestyle,  what careers would make you that salary,  what major you need to get that job, how much that major would cost and how many years it would take, how to take out a loan (student or otherwise), how to/ if you should use a credit card,  how to choose a good university, how to ask for a raise, how to prepare for an interview, how to fill out job and college applications, how to choose a good community to settle down in, how to choose an insurance company, how to watch out for scams and cons, how to plan out the next few years of your life, how to save for retirement, how to fill out tax forms, how to find a good attorney, how to conduct yourself in a civil suit, how to market your skills, which skills do employers look for in new hires, how to plan your schedule / calendar, good time management, how to write a letter, etc.  The list goes on and on. I admit this was quite exhaustive and demanding, but I think that not enough young people are properly prepared for the important, often complex and not straight forward, daily struggles and demands of adult life. It can certainly be seen as a failure of our public education system, because, beyond providing a basic worldly understanding and general background knowledge, primary school should prepare students for life after school. Instead, we are just thrown out into the real world, which has very little in common with school, and expected to know what we are doing.

It's really easy..... You see acceleration is basically change in velocity over time or velocity by time.... Velocity\u00f7Time Now substitute the SI units of these:Velocity is metre per second and time is second (Remember that we can use hrs but seconds is the most frequently used) So,it becomes m\\s\\'s Then it becomes m\\s \u00d7 s (you know,that thing in math where the last denominator changes into multiplication if the numerator is a fraction or something )  Anyways,In metre per second \u00d7 second -> this second can be written as 1/second...
