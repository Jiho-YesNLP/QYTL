Here is the process: (1) Flip the sign of multiplier at each elimination step.  (2) Directly add it in the L matrix in the same position (index) of L.  In the example of 18:00, flip (-2) I get 2, then add 2 in position L[2,1]; flip (-5) I get 5, add 5 in position L[2,3]. So I got L.  BTW, another way to understand that L is better than E is that:  (1) When producing E, there are interfered operations happening and thus a new (implicit) relationship between row1 and row3 is formed. As a result, a new entry (10) is appearing to reflect the newly created (implicit) relationship among row1 and row3, as shown at the position E[3, 1].  (2) When producing L, the operations are in the right order that there are no interfered operations thus no implicit relationships were generated. So we can just plug in the multiplier (the entry) directly to L, without worrying about missing any entries.  (3) As a side note, the entry value tells about the multiplication, BUT more importantly, the index of each entry tells about he the relationship between rows. Eg. In matrix E32, the entry E[3, 2] = -5, it means the change coming from row2 to row3, with (-5) as the amount. Getting an explicit explanation on the role of entry indexes helps a lot to build some intuitive in a long run.  Thank you Dr. Strang.

As n becomes \"big\", this sum approaches n^3 / 3. His approach in the lecture is also good. Plot a graph of y = x^2 and identify the points x = n, x = n-1, x = n-2, ..., x = 1, and you'll find that if n is big enough, the discrete plots start to look more and more like the curve y = x^2, which then allows you to approximate the area under the curve. Again, what you get for a reasonably large n is n^3 / 3. One final thing is, if these operations are performed in a loop, you'll need way more time, because his analysis assumes an operation on an entire row.

This is what the permutations are all about. Whenever you have done a row exchange you can think of this way: there are four ways to put a 1 in any given row, but then there are only three ways to put a 1 in the next row you choose since you cannot get any 1\u2019s above and below each other), and then there are two ways to choose the third 1 and for the last row you only have one position left in which to complete the order and thereby the row exchange.   Altogether this makes for 4x3x2x1 ways to choose the order of the 1\u2019s or n! ways to order a given n x n matrix and this type of rearranging is called \u201cpermuting\u201d and every instance of ordering is a single permutation.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "MsIvs_6vC38", "cid": "Ugx-EMhhtymrHJQxrRp4AaABAg.8Xjkag7a4a68nM3aOduWhv", "comment": "I'm a year late, but here comes a somewhat intuitive explaination.
