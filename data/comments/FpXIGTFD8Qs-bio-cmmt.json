Heavy chains are made of a V segment + D segment + J segment ( there are different V and D and J segments in our genome which is part of the reason why Igs have a high polymorphism ). First the D and J segments get together by \"cutting\" what's between them, then the V and DJ segments get together. After splicing the constant region of the chain is assembled with the VDJ. for the light chain, gene rearranging happens after proliferation and there's only a V and a J segment so you end up with a VJ variable section. V stands for variable, D for diversity and J for junction if I remember correctly.

This makes all B cells to produce different antibodies. At this time this antibodies are not secreted. It is only on cell surface and it is IgM type. Combination of three genes produce a high number of anibody diversity. But some antibodies are not suitable because some antibodies are for human tissue and cell antigens. So T cells recognizes it whith MHCII and orders to the B cells to kill himself (this means apopitosis). After this APC (antigen presenting cells) dendritic cells tests the antigens on B cell's surface that is it appropriate for the antigen that entered to the body. If the B cell can attach to the dentritic cells with its antibody , it will be chosen. The other B cells that can not attach to the antigen on dentritic cells' surface, they won't survive and they will die.  In a siple way for explanation: Fishes produces millions of eggs to have a baby fish. all eggs can not survive. All eggs go to selection process and the most attractive, strong, healhy egg will survive and other will die. To get a strong and right selection nature uses probabilty. To get a good chance, it dice millions time.  Second step is antibody maturation and for this B cells goes to hypermutation in lymph nodes. This is more complex and this is real mutation that our body simulates to be done. After this hypermutation, antibody that is produced by selected (chosen) B cells has mpre affinity and more selectivity. After first exposure to the antigen, second and more exposures makes this somatic hypermutations again and antibody becomes also more durable.  third step is Class switch: To secrete antibodies, B cells must change to plasma cells. but after VDJ rearrangement and somatic hypermutations, it can only produce IgM antibody (and some IgD). it is very big antibody and for a short time in infection, it is effective but it has disadvantage. it can't be secreted out of blood vessels. so to protect the intestines and respiratory sytems, antibody genes switch to IgA , IgE and IgG antibody type. this is called Class switch.
