You don't have to check all the subsets. Tom says that and he hints on why it's correct (you can also check the book). You can see why it's true by taking a subset of size n - 1. To prove they are independent, then for all x1, x2, ..., xn-1, we need to prove Pr(R1=x1 & ... & Rn-1=xn-1) = Pr(R1=x1) * ... * Pr(Rn-1=xn-1). We know that R1, R2, ..., Rn are independent, hence for all yn we have Pr(R1=x1 & ... & Rn-1=xn-1& Rn=yn) = Pr(R1=x1) * ... * Pr(Rn=yn); notice here that the xi's are fixed and we loop over yn. Now, if you sum up over all possible yi's which is Sum_{yi} Pr(R1=x1 & ... & Rn-1=xn-1& Rn=yi) = Sum_{yi}  Pr(R1=x1) * ... * Pr(Rn=yi); now factor out with Pr(R1=x1) * ... * Pr(Rn-1=xn-1), and you get Pr(R1=x1) * ... * Pr(Rn-1=xn-1) Sum_{yi} Pr(Rn=yi). The sum Sum_{yi} Pr(Rn=yi) is equal to 1. Hence we proved the independence of the smaller subset.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "MOfhhFaQdjw", "cid": "UgyH2IV8nYs_AFuvRlF4AaABAg.8bjIGXDaXJs8boLisMhWPb", "comment": "Sorry, no recitation videos were recorded... but there are recitation notes available on MIT OpenCourseWare at http://ocw.mit.edu/6-042JF10.", "votes": "8", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "MOfhhFaQdjw", "cid": "UgyH2IV8nYs_AFuvRlF4AaABAg.8bjIGXDaXJs8c5jWRCI1Ad", "comment": "Very useful.
