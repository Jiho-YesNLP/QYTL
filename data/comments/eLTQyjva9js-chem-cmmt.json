If I were to instead add a gas molecule that actually does participate, then I would be increasing pressure of only one side. For example, if i increase pressure by adding nitrogen, then the left side would increase in pressure. This means that the reaction would shift to the right, thereby decreasing pressure. Note that this is due to entropy.

You would be increasing pressure! But you are increasing pressure evenly on both side. Entropy dictates that in this case, since both side increase by the same amount of pressure, nothing will happen!
