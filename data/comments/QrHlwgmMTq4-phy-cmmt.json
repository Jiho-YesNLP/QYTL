It's all fire because all elements are made of the same subatomic particles; protons electrons and neutrons....when plasma happens, im guessing that since the subatomic particles are flowing freely regardless of whatever salt, element, hydrocarbon, acid, and molecule they're in, that is the same plasma as everything else)))))))A hot, magnetic soupy mess of electrons, protons, and neutrons just flowing wherever they want until things cool back down and they can rearrange. Only when the subatomic molecules are arranged into different atoms and they go back to their bonds is when the phase change varies because they're part of different molecules .
