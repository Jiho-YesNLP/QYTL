To your question, since it's a tournament graph, so for a set W include all chicken except u and v, all chicken can either peck or be pecked by u and v. Assume chicken u has most outdegree, and it NOT a king, so that means v can peck u within two steps(direct or through some chicken in set A, but since if it's not direct then u can peck v so..., it means v can directly peck u) and u can't peck back through somechicken in set W, so there're two subsets of W, A and B, which chicken in A can peck v but they can also peck u, and chicken in B that u can peck but can't peck v. 1.Chicken in B is part of v's outdegree, other two subsets of W are u->C->v, v->D->u, which C doesn't exist otherwise u can peck v, so does D is a part of v's outdegree. 2.So (sizeof(B+D) + 1)=od(v) > (sizeof(B))=od(u)(I think that expression at 1:22:17 is confusion indeed, this should be better), alongside B+D is of course already >= B, which is impossible with the assumption that u has largest degree. 3.Rest of proof is what video already contains so no more to talk now.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
