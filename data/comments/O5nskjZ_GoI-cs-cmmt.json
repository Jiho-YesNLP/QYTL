I also understand that it may be impossible for humans to reach that point and that this example is problematic in itself, as it is difficult to debate or prove something that is, for the most part, unknown/undiscovered to us at this time. You may be correct in that the matter of the universe cannot be broken down in a logical way to its fullest capacity, but, currently there is no possible way to know for sure.\r \r If it is impossible to determine exactly what \"2+2=4\" is and why it works, then how do you really know that it is correct or exists at all? \r I am not denying that the \"infinite number of unmentionable assumptions\" can be broken down, but that the acceptance of an infinite set means that it is not required and that it is more important to fully understand the reasons behind why that is and why that works the way it does. This would be considered fully broken down because every nuance is now understood.   Apologies if this seems like a straw-man, but it seems that your main point was in fact to communicate that things cannot always be broken down all the way. That complexity does not always include simple standalone units. This leads me to believe that your belief system does not line up with cause and effect. \r \r If you do believe in cause and effect, then you would believe that everything happens for a reason. Therefore, complex concepts would be a causality of inferior units/aspects. Thus, proving that all complex systems eventually break down into simple units.

You see, if you think of a train as simply a train with a few possible states, then \"the train is moving at 120 km/h to the west\" is a much simpler system to understand than the sum of its parts (the cargo, the wheels, the internal heat, the amount of neutrinos flying by, etc)  So breaking it down doesn't seem to reduce complexity : abstracting up does.

He found a way to use long threaded rods, i.e. screws, to more easily calculate division problems. The problem in the late 1700s: screws were rare and usually handmade, and therefore irregularly threaded and too low quality to perform exact division.  So Jesse Ramsden invented a new type of screw-making machine, which could churn out long perfectly threaded screw rods. His division screws never really caught on. And yet, totally by accident, he helped invent the screw machine, popularize the modern fastener screw, and revolutionize construction and engineering.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "O5nskjZ_GoI", "cid": "Ugi8zPuo5OCNoHgCoAEC", "comment": "I like the host.

While there were Blackberry devices around in my college years, the smartphone didn't come out until a year after I joined the workforce. Now everybody has a calculator, and so much more, on their person at all times. The access to computing power is only going to increase so much more over the next decade and it's hard to see what the tools of tomorrow will be.  This is why I view mathematics as less practical training for adulthood, and more of an exercise of your brain to train it to think through problems. I've never had any exercise in using an Abacus or a sliderule. Interestingly I do remember using square root tables (something apparently it was through I'd use in the \"real world\").
