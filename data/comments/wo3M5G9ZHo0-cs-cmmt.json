Transmission Time = Message size / Bandwidth\r \r Propagation Delay: The amount of time a bit takes to go from device A to device B.  Propagation Time = Distance / Propagation speed\r \r Queuing Delay: The third component in latency. It is the time needed for each intermediate or end device to hold the message before it can be processes.  This delay is not a fixed factor; it changes with the load imposed on the network.\r When there is heavy traffic on the network, the queuing time increases.\r \r Processing Delay: The amount of time a node takes to process the sent message.
