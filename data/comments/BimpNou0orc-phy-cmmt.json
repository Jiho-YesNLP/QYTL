Most students memorise and apply this in circuits without understanding the physical processes involved.  It will be useful to learn the operation of charging a capacitor using a unified approach to electrostatics and circuits. Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two. To learn the operation of circuits it is instructive to understand Current,\u00a0the conduction process, resistors and\u00a0Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos: i.\u00a0https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo\u00a0and ii.\u00a0https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo  It is not possible in this post to discuss the charging of an uncharged capacitor. During the first few nanoseconds after switch ON, while the surface charges arrange themselves, there is no electric field E_cap and fringe field because there is no initial charge on its plates; it is as though the capacitor was not there - as though there were a continuous wire with no break in it.  The last frame References in video #1\u00a0 lists two textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss in detail with a series of sequential diagrams the physical processes in charging and discharging a capacitor. The current (sinusoidal steady-state) in a capacitor is due to the resultant electric field E_net (resultant of the applied field and an opposing electric field, the fringe field). If the capacitance of the capacitor C is made large, then the fringe field does not build as fast as it would have if C were to be smaller. With a large C, the charge sprays on the plates do not result in developing a large voltage in a given interval of time as evident from the capacitor voltage-charge relation Q = CV. The fringe field is smaller and the net field consequently is greater. Therefore, at a fixed frequency, the current increases as the size of the capacitor is increased. The current also increases as the frequency is increased. So, we say it passes higher frequencies of applied voltage. If the frequency is made smaller, the fringe field builds very rapidly and in the limit when it is dc, it blocks the applied voltage. The last frame References in video #1\u00a0 lists textbook 4 which discusses these topics in more detail\u00a0using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of reactance.
