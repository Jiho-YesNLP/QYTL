Adding a third vector in the plane to the matrix is superfluous to the column space, it would be a free column.  The x-y plane can't gain a dimension just by rotating its normal vector.

Does rank(A) = rank(A^T) in general?  The professor seems to be hinting at this, but rref(A) only preserves the column space, so it doesn\u2019t seem so trivial to me. Any insight is highly appreciated.  Edit: I found the answer. rank(A) = rank(A^T) by virtue of the fact that linear independence of the columns implies linear independence of the rows, even for non-square matrices. I proved this for myself this evening. The main idea for the proof (at least how I did it) is that if you have two linearly dependent rows, one above the other say, row reduction kills the lower one (reduces number of possibly independent rows). Killing off the row (making the row all zeros) also makes it so that the given row can\u2019t have a pivot. Thus, we\u2019ve reduced the number of potential pivot columns by one. That\u2019s the relationship in a nutshell. The math is only slightly more involved", "votes": "7", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "nHlE7EgJFds", "cid": "UgwcyKoKHUAH6ZtvUr94AaABAg", "comment": "At 14:00 that\u2019s not true in general. The number of basis vectors of C(A) is rank(A) yes but said basis vectors are not the pivot columns. The professor probably misspoke or something.  Doing rref(A) of a matrix means we\u2019re taking linear combinations of the rows of A, so there\u2019s no reason to believe the column space will be preserved during the row-reduction operations. In general, C(A) is not equal to C(rref(A)).  Let A^T stand for transpose of matrix A. Then the following is always true: C(A) = C( ( rref(A^T) )^T ) . He\u2019s kind of implied this already in previous lectures without using the rote notation, I\u2019m just connecting the dots like a game.  Edit:  A simple example is A = [1,2; 2,4]. rref(A) = [1,2; 0,0]. The column space of rref(A) is along the \u201cy\u201d axis whereas the column space of A is along the line \u201cy\u201d = 2 \u201dx\u201d. It should be clear that aside from the zero vector, they have no other vectors in common. Further, rref(A) has one pivot column, so the dimension of A should be 1. 2*[1;2] = [2;4] (columns are linearly dependent, so we really only have 1 vector to scale. Hence, dimension of C(A) = r = 1, as earlier predicted \ud83d\ude0a  Hopefully this helps someone. Professor Strang is one of the best educators out there, I see why people admire MIT!

Lets call them vector Q, and R.  Two independent vectors describe a plane. Lets also suppose that you have multiplied or divided Q by what ever number is needed to make vector Q have a leading 1. The next thing you are going to do is to subtract any multiple of vector Q in vector R to get a new second row with no component in the first column. What does this literally mean when you draw vectors Q and R? Draw some vector Q and some vector R through the origin. Now break R into a component parallel to Q and a component perpendicular to Q. IF you subtract whatever multiple of Q from R, your left with that perpendicular component. Notice that these 2 vectors Q and the vector R-kQ are still are in the plane initially made by Q and R.  Swapping the order in which you write the vectors does not change the space spanned by vectors. Taking a multiple of a vector in the row space does not change the space spanned by that vector and the other basis vectors....because....you already can take any multiple and or linear combination of basis vectors to describe the space.   On the other hand, what do row space operations do to the columns. Suppose you have the first column vector <a,b,c,d> transpose ie write a then b then c then d in a vertical column.  Subtracting some number k times the first row from the second row as you would in row reduction and you have the vector      <0,b-ka, c,d> transpose. This is not the same column vector as <a,b,c,d> transpose.  This problem happens in every column where the component in row 1 is not zero for that column.   If you wanted to preserve the column space....take A transpose, and do row operations. This is sometimes done for example if you wished to determine if the columns of A are linearly independent OR if you wished to determine a basis for the column space of A with numbers much lower than those used in the original matrix A.   Can you define a set of operations where you take linear combinations of columns and take those away from other columns in matrix A? You could do that and know that this preserves the column space but not the row space. In working with determinants....both column operations and row operations are allowed before calculating the determinant. Sometimes this will reduce a matrix from something with huge numbers down to a matrix where the determinant can be calculated in your head. You have not yet studied the determinant of a matrix. My point is that it is not that column operations are NEVER done, its just that if you mix column and row operations you must know what changes and if that is what you want. For now just do row operations on A, or row operations on A transpose. Once you are very fluent with those....the book will lead you toward when column operations are appropriate and what that means.   Question: Could you take a vector....and arbitrarily set one of its components to zero and claim the vector is preserved? Isnt that what you do to column 1 when you take some multiple of row 1 from row 2 Didnt you just set the first component of row 2 of the column 1 vector to zero while leaving all else intact? From the column point of view, row operations allow you to set any component to zero while leaving the other components in the column intact.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "nHlE7EgJFds", "cid": "UgxgINAWL9mQU7G0ySp4AaABAg.8dUN_IKzVnu92PEv4mH7Wh", "comment": "Look up lectures by Steven Boyd. \"Stanford Engineering Everywhere\" is like Stanford's version of OCW and has some great courses in convex optimization: EE263 and EE364A.
