It's a subtle distinction but useful for people to understand as they get much deeper into math. It can also be applied to situations like the gamma function being consistent with [a translation of] the factorial function.

Yes, sadly there are many teachers who don't know why things are true and just insist some students do it a certain way. I remember in 7th grade my math teacher marked me wrong for something that I actually did correctly, because she misremembered something a past teacher had taught her and she didn't understand how it actually worked (or perhaps the past teacher just explained it wrong).  I was also the go-to teacher at a summer program for other students to get help understanding some math concept if they weren't certain, and I was a little dismayed at one teacher not having a good idea of how phase shifts worked when she was supposed to be teaching a Precalculus/Trigonometry class. I taught her and she seemed to grasp it in the moment; I hope she retained it well enough to teach her class.  One last bit of irony is that when I took a College Geometry class designed for math education majors in university, the math majors like myself generally performed significantly better in the class than the math education majors.
