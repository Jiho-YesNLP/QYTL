Since it wants to keep going the same direction, the change in current turning off is a gradual change.

It also covers the calculation of induced EMF and the use of transformers in changing voltage. Faraday's law is essential in understanding the principles behind electromagnetic induction and its various applications.   - 00:01 Moving a magnet into or away from a coil induces a current in the coil, with the direction of the current depending on the direction of movement. - 12:46 The induced magnetic field in a loop is opposite in direction to the external magnetic field, and the current direction can be determined using the right-hand rule. - 25:32 According to Lenz's law, the induced current in a circular wire will create a magnetic field that opposes the original magnetic field, meaning it will be in the opposite direction. - 38:18 The video explains how to calculate induced EMF and current using Faraday's Law. - 51:02 The video explains how to use Faraday's law of induction to calculate induced EMF and how to derive an equation for calculating the magnitude of induced EMF for a moving conductor in a magnetic field. - 01:03:48 The magnetic force acting on a rod with current in the presence of a magnetic field is equal to the force required to keep it moving at that speed. - 01:16:34 The video explains how to calculate current, voltage, and power in a transformer. - 01:29:22 The video explains how to calculate the inductance of a solenoid and its potential energy.

I noticed in science and engineering, teachers and authors often talk about or refer to the same concept but however, they adopt some symbol that they like and not use the common or standard symbol for that situation the teacher is discussing or writing a book about that concept but chose a new set of variable symbols.  This is harder to grasp for beginners but teachers keep doing this annoying thing.  It is done often in teaching and in new textbooks.  And you are doing this here with this video.

And that is Faraday's Law.   The current is a result of the combination of an opposing Coulomb electric field and the applied field which is changing the current. The opposing Coulomb (C) field is a result of polarization of the inductor by the non-Coulomb (NC) electric field. So, the current is a consequence of the resultant field of the applied field and the Coulomb electric field in the inductance coil and is determined using the governing relation in conductors J = \u03c3E_net. If the resistance of the solenoid is very small, the magnitude of the two electric fields is nearly equal (E_C ~ E_NC).   It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the formation of the Coulomb field when the current in an inductor is changed.  Before learning Faraday's Law and its application to the operation of inductors, it will be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level\u00a0 as in the following two videos:  i. https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo and  ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discusses topics on inductance and inductors in more detail using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of inductive reactance.  It also describes with sequential diagrams how an inductor develops the induced emf. Textbook 4 shows how the current lags the voltage across the inductor by 90 degrees for sinusoidal input voltages using sequential diagrams.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "UgyPUzGuNRuq2DR_v1J4AaABAg", "comment": "Oh Lord help me to have all the knowledge of Science and put it to good use...", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "Ugz0rKZ0zO32nkFglsd4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you so much u have actually simplified everything here thank u again and again and again", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "Ugx_PbBF1KLZ_eW6kYN4AaABAg", "comment": "Super nice", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "UgwcdW-j_beVHa08t554AaABAg", "comment": "Help us with a clap and bt 137 triac operations", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "UgySmd8Q1ZC7ZWjuntl4AaABAg", "comment": "So nice the world's best teacher", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "Ugw-1nd27UvxwBgTwct4AaABAg", "comment": "Can you put the translation feature in this video, I'd rather read than listen, thank you", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "jz92oOkJFNA", "cid": "Ugx9CF4Bf5F2ydzpn914AaABAg", "comment": "You are brilliant.
