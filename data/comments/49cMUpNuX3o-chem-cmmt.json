Releasing the DAT, OAT, and MCAT courses this last summer made my life a LOT busier than I anticipated.  Last year I produced both organic chemistry and high school chemistry playlists, so I thought I'd have time for both general chemistry and biochemistry this year.  So not the case and I had to choose one and unfortunately I went with general chemistry.  So biochem has been delayed until next year. \u2639", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "49cMUpNuX3o", "cid": "UgxEGVR5m5xliJxWjx94AaABAg.9VQ61xi2-s19VQB6rHg4lQ", "comment": "You're welcome, Welton - and thank you.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
