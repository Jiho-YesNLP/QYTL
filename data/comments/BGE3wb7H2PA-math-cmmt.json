The way we define polar coordinates is that we can use a negative value for r or positive value for r to depict the same coordinate given that we shift cos and sine by pi (i.e., cos(x + pi) = - cos(x) and same for pi). But the thing is, we can pick any angle we want for our polar equations and eventually we'll get a repeating loop because the cosines and sines are periodic with the same period. So any coordinate corresponding to some negative r for some angle cosine will also be hit again when r is positive and pi is added to that angle (just pi in this case since we haven't done any scale changes). Generalize this for all the valid combinations of r and theta, and we end up retracing the same curve, so the -r case is not important.  The professor hints at this in the last lecture when he introduces polar coordinates and says that r = \" + OR - \" sqrt(x^2 + y^2), meaning r is the union of both since we can really always pick either one. Of course r^2 = x^2 + y^2 doesn't have the uncertainty of which one we have to pick.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "BGE3wb7H2PA", "cid": "UgwskieGlU0msKbC3aF4AaABAg.9NmtTRKypWW9Nmtqbpwo21", "comment": "My bad.
