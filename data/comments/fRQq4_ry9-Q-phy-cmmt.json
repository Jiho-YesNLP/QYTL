Since the obj is in equilibrium there must be a force equal to the weight force which is the normal force, perpendicular to the surface and magnitude equal to the weight of the object.  normal force increases when further force is applied to the object perpendicularly. in this case, as the net force is still zero, then the sum of the weight force and the external force is equal to the normal force. -mg -Fadditional + Fnormal = 0 (as mg and Fa are in downward direction and Fnet = 0) thus mg + Fa = Fn  normal force decreases when an object's weight force is somehow decreased, which can be done by pulling it upward with a rope/string (i.e tension). in this case, the difference of mg from T (T=tension) is equivalent to normal force as Fn = mg.   normal force cannot be negative in cases where tension upwards is greater than the weight force downwards. instead, the object starts to accelerate, violate newton's first law and cease to have Fnet = 0. the object is pulled away from the surface and its normal force is instead 0.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "Ugwh7cHYMpQmWmTRFzB4AaABAg", "comment": "love your videos", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgxpQTwvd5Pw8493d7h4AaABAg", "comment": "\u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "Ugy_URyFBhpqCxQi3894AaABAg", "comment": "you used calculator for 20X9.8, lol", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgydmquvvoKg0BaapcV4AaABAg", "comment": "Pull out \ud83e\udd72", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "Ugzwm4DNRitMRnoYBll4AaABAg", "comment": "Who sees this in march 2024", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgxIL1qJqEcDUsz9EHN4AaABAg", "comment": "Physics is actually not that difficult when you learn it from this guy", "votes": "9", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgxkY-VnFyB4z_XA-3t4AaABAg", "comment": "pls reply to this comment to remind me how far I have come", "votes": "1", "replies": "4", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgzbC-TVyUn5AEK2qgd4AaABAg", "comment": "Reaction force", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgzJFChnNGw52A03z8l4AaABAg", "comment": "Is the normal force always opposite the weight", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgzEV4TLWaxb_7avjOB4AaABAg", "comment": "I wonder when there is a certain value of net force in vertical direction, can there be a normal force?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgxlAjhwqJRbfAzFwIl4AaABAg", "comment": "i know inclined plane though", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "Ugy7DXHPq0CQ4dZ3U0p4AaABAg", "comment": "meaning of perpendicular?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "UgxvFfT_MGG5ywga7mV4AaABAg", "comment": "um i am a 4th grader,  can you explain in a simpler way", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "fRQq4_ry9-Q", "cid": "Ugyor6oyrpfDAX51WDx4AaABAg", "comment": "Where is the normal force when boat on water?

At the atomic level, it is the local repulsion forces between adjacent atoms' outermost shell of electrons.

But bring them close enough, and the outermost electrons of each adjacent atom repel each other, stronger than they attract their neighbor's nucleus.  This series of inter-atomic repulsion forces, throughout the structure of a solid, is what builds the normal force.
