I clearly see how the distance, when the line has its origin at (0, 0), is equal to the hypotenuse of the rectangle triangle that has rise and run as legs.    Now, imagine a line that goes from (2, 3) to (5, 3). You could clearly see that it has a length of 3, but if you wanted to derive it from the formula, how can we know it? If you plug the coordinates into the formula, it gives back the length, but now the legs of that triangle are not rise over run (they are diagonals in respect to the X-Y axis).
