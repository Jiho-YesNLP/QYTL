(If I get something wrong, feel free to correct me and I will edit this comment, I am new to coding.)  The reason that list.sort() and list.reverse() return None, while sorted(list) returns a list's values, is basically that the methods are completed by different means. Code that returns None is completed \"in-place,\" which means that the original variable itself is not duplicated, only changed. Python does not want you to think that a new variable has been/could be created after running the method .sort() or .reverse() (or any other in-place method), and so it returns None. It is basically telling you that any method that is done in-place CANNOT generate a new variable because it has not duplicated the old variable.   Meanwhile, sorted(list) is creating a new list entirely, and so you can assign it to a new variable name. ( sortedList = sorted(originalList) )  So basically, don't assign in-place methods to any new variables.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RvRKT-jXvko", "cid": "UgzgF-tMhmqkyMgitgJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks for this!
