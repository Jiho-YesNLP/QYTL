You're misunderstanding the question as a whole. First of all, remember that the SHELL n=4 only has only two orbitals (configurations) with ml=-2, namely n=4, l=2, ml =-2 and n=4, l=3; ml=-2. So your 10 \"orbitals\" (-2,-1,0,1,2 x 2) make no sense, because you are including 8 where ml does not equal -2. I hope this clarifies. This also goes for you @fgarnold .
