It is hard to watch someone you love go through this terrible disease. Unfortunately, our drug is not at the stage where we can use it for human trials yet. However, there are many new targeted therapies coming each week, one of which may help and/or provide her better quality of life. I hope the doctors you are working with can find other trials that she may be eligible for to  give her that chance to be with you and her kids for a long time. You and your family will be in my thoughts and prayers.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
