You can't simply assert that the NSF is beneficial just because they spend money because you have to take into account what else that money may have been spent on and whether it spends money on successful projects or failed projects since failed projects further distort the marketplace by wasting time and resources that would otherwise have been put to better uses. Think about what all those highly intelligent people working for the NSA to spy on us for no benefit might have done in the private sector where they actually have to produce something useful to society to profit.  That government spending was a misallocation of resources which ended up having a very limited benefit (which is the general trend of how government allocates money in every area) leaving our market open to competition from the Japanese.

Sure, you can have world records for other things, but that's not what people are usually talking about when they refer to world records. As such, using sports with technological advances as a counterpoint to most of sports can be generalized to all areas pretty easily. People have been running, vaulting and all that stuff for a very long time, and most of the improvements that can be made have already been made, and as such, world records aren't changing very fast in these areas. This is meant to parallel improvements in CPUs. On the other hand, new swimsuit materials have allowed swimmers to experience less drag and swim faster; technology has allowed a significant leap in our capabilities from a source we'd never had access to before.

It would break the record. Whether anyone cares or not is irrelevant to the breaking of records. Some guy could make the world's largest oatmeal raisin cookie and nobody would care, but the record is broken anyway. If people cared later, they could probably look back and find that this was indeed the world's largest raisin cookie. Sure, someone put in some work to break the record, which is an investment, but it could also be a secondary effect of completing some other task. In the case of olympic athletes, the people paying the athlete to run really don't care about the record being broken, they care about the public noticing and buying their equipment. The record being broken was not valued but happened anyway. Current olympic sports are valued more highly than historical olympic sports? I guess it's possible, but I think the relative viewership is probably due to the relative populations and ease of access. Historical events had to be attended in person, meaning you had to have a lot of money and free time to attend. The general public could have valued them the same and viewership still could've been lower. There was also far less people on earth. The global populations has more than doubled since 1950.  Desktop sales are dropping, true, but as the technology slows down, existing computers aren't made obsolete as often, and many people already have sufficiently new and powerful desktops. I doubt anyone's throwing away desktop computers to get a phone, and I strongly doubt anyone is making a decision between buying a desktop and a smartphone. They're used for different things. They're in different markets. Design work uses desktop computers and will probably continue to use desktop computers for the foreseeable future. You need the computing power to run simulations, compile code and encode videos. They also have their own games market which uses the power and easy input of desktops. The general public uses smartphones for their portability. They can be carried everywhere and allow communication across the world. Their ability as a computer is secondary to their value for accesing the internet and making calls. If for some reason desktops were primarily used for accessing the internet, they couldn't compete with phones, or if for some reason phones were primarily used for their computing power, they wouldn't be able to compete with desktops.  So if the reason smartphones are doing better isn't because they're outcompeting desktops, then it must be for other reasons, the mostly likely of these being they've entered new markets that desktops are still too expensive and not sufficiently broadly useful to enter. Like developing countries. I guess my point here is there's a lot more at play than just how much people value things.
