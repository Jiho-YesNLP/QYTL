A coulomb electric field results and we note that an attempt to change the current in the coil induces an emf in the same coil and makes the coil sluggish to respond to current changes. Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two. To learn the operation of circuits it is instructive to understand Current, the conduction process, resistors and Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos:   i.\u00a0https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo\u00a0and ii.\u00a0https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo It is not possible in this post to discuss the production of induced emfs in inductors in detail.   \u00a0The last frame References in video #1 lists two textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss in detail with a series of sequential diagrams the physical processes to explain the operation of inductors and RL circuits.   \u00a0RL circuit frequency domain  The existence of a sinusoidal current resulting from the application of a sinusoidal voltage to an inductor is a characteristic of the non-Coulomb electric field that is proportional to the rate of change in current causing a changing magnetic field.   \u00a0The current is a result of an opposing Coulomb electric field, which is a result of polarization by the non-Coulomb electric field associated with the changing magnetic field, and the current is a consequence of the resultant field of the applied field and the Coulomb electric field in the inductance coil.   Inductors find applications as filters in power supplies and in resonant circuits in tuned amplifiers.   If we increase the \u201cfrequency\u201d of the input voltage to an inductor, the \u201crate of change\u201d of the input voltage and the applied field is \u201cgreater than\u201d the rates obtained with applied voltages at lower frequencies. At low frequencies, this causes a smaller induced opposing electric field and emf, therefore, large currents will flow within small intervals of time in the coils of the inductor.   In the limit, if the input is a dc voltage, the current will become so large that the inductor will burn out.   In an inductor, the opposition to the applied voltage which is changing the current is instantaneous and so, the current can only follow after the applied field has overcome the opposing emf. In an inductor for sinusoidal currents, the current lags the voltage by 90 degrees if the inductor is pure, and less if a resistance is in series with it; the inductor fights before current flows. If an inductor weren\u2019t to fight, you will get energy for free!   Low pass filters are built using L-R circuits in simple applications. Therefore, we say the inductor \u201cblocks high frequencies\u201d and acts as a \u201cshort circuit\u201d at low frequencies as if the inductor was not there but a wire.   \u00a0It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail current in inductor circuits and inductive reactance with sequential diagrams (textbook 4, see below).   The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss these topics in more detail using a unified approach and provide an intuitive understanding of reactance.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RR0sQeDAxgk", "cid": "UgzxWArrgDRmiVW0ndp4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks for all you do \ud83e\udd17", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RR0sQeDAxgk", "cid": "Ugx57bKnVj-5yeLk77h4AaABAg", "comment": "This simplified what my teacher overcomplicated.

Lets say we have an inducting coil, but it is make of a super-conductor. We fill that super-conducting coil with current and store energy in magnetic field that is created. We unplug the coil from the current source and current flows forever, because there is no resistance.     Now comes the difficult part I don't understand: since now energy is stored in a magnetic field, and stored energy is a state of higher potential, wouldn't be normal to expect magnetic field to want to collapse back to zero and in process coil current will fade away to zero, as well?
