Auroux missed a nice opportunity at the beginning to clarify the sign convention for flux by foreshadowing the result for closed curves with + being from the inside, out. I'm not faulting anyone, I couldn't give a lecture on this and keep possession of both my hands when erasing blackboards operated by hazardous machines.
