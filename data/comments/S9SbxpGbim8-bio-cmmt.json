Sodium hydrogen carbonate is used in experiments to provide CO2 for photosynthesis. When it dissolves in water, it releases CO2 gas.  As you increase the light intensity, the rate of photosynthesis becomes faster.  As light intensity increases, CO2 availability from the NaHCO3 solution may not be enough to keep up with the increased rate of photosynthesis. (The CO2 in the solution may become used up, limiting the plant's ability to continue photosynthesis at a faster rate.)  So, as you increase light intensity, the rate of photosynthesis increases up to a point and then levels off or slows down, it could be an indication that CO2 availability from the NaHCO3 solution has become the limiting factor.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCL9pAVv96yi9v", "comment": "Wishing you all the very best for your exams! \ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCL9pBKXhJZD7I", "comment": "me too!!!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCL9xrK8STaLmA", "comment": "same", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCL9zH17hi1xW1", "comment": "Same", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCLA-EvJ0HE7Wq", "comment": "Me too", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCLA02achXlGAh", "comment": "Same", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCLA2ucXdXZku2", "comment": "Same bro", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "Ugzuhwpo77GhVO1_cr94AaABAg.9pAGL27UPCLA7DeslvAvf-", "comment": "Same situation here bro \ud83d\ude02", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "S9SbxpGbim8", "cid": "UgwLnzxpw_Mrw43FCRV4AaABAg.9nZPNyKj48G9n_lZFHTMQK", "comment": "Thank you for your suggestion!
