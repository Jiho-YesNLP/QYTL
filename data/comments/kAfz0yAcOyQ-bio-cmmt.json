In fact, ancient Greek, with its exceptional flexibility, versatility, and rich productivity, calls for agile, smart intellects not afraid of giving full firing exercise to those neurons of the pre-frontal cortex. We know too well that we're not going to get Prof. Sapolsky to change his feelings overnight, and start loving the ancient Greek language a little more.

However, consider the multitude of questions left open in the 2004 edition of the ZEBRAS book. This was a time when research was beginning to explode on all fronts of neurobiology and endocrinology in all the best universities, with the brightest minds attracted to pursuing research on the most promising open questions. The literature on the new research results has exploded during those last 20 years to immense proportions. Knowledge and data of the new science have grown exponentially. Even some dated vocabulary would need adjustment. The 3d edition of 2004 already feels a bit antiquated, as if still belonging to the pioneering days of the research. It is in an urgent need of a complete revamping and freshening up.. The rewrite required by a 4th edition would be a gigantic, even colossal undertaking. At 65, Prof. Sapolsky is an aging man, with no longer the drive,  energy, and stamina of his 20s when he embarked  on the systematic study of stress as a new, promising field, with his beloved hormones, (epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucocorticoids) in the lab, and favorite baboons in Kenya. In addition, retreading once again along the same beaten paths for a much better view may seem less appealing to an aging, tiring scholar, still attracted by new horizons and topics.\u00a0 Even with the marshalling of a huge cohort of research assistants (as he did for his monumental BEHAVE), to scan and select the most meaningful new discoveries, the task of going through that immensity of reports and rewriting an updated version of  ZEBRAS seems colossal and daunting. On reflection, the odds seem very high that Prof. Sapolsky will not muster the courage and desire to undertake a 4th edition of ZEBRAS.\u00a0So sad, as nobody else will. The famoous book, GRAY\u2019S ANATOMY, has gone through up to 40 editions. The ZEBRAS book, which could well be labeled SAPOLSKY\u2019S BIOLOGY OF STRESS, would be worth at least one more edition under his supervision to reflect the tremendous scientific expansion.

And there's no chance that our Incredibly Learned Professor would ever edit his cycle of 27 lectures given at Stanford Un. to incorporate new findings.\u00a0  In a similar vein, Prof. Sapolsky's famous book on Stress, WHY ZEBRAS DON'T GET ULCERS (3d. ed. 2004), left many points of detail quite open. Now, in 2022, nearly 20 years later, many of those points and notes could receive more advanced and complete answers. Couldn\u2019t Prof. Sapolsky reasonably consider tackling the huge, vastly important project of a 4th edition of this vital ZEBRAS book, and  have it also labeled with the new name of SAPOLSKY'S BIOLOGY OF STRESS? At this stage in life, our Incredibly Learned Professor's reputation is made. He\u2019s already produced the magnum opus that consecrates his top scholarly standing in the academic community \u2014 the huge encyclopedic BEHAVE brick. He is now  retired from active teaching, and has the time to focus on this project. He knows the open issues intimately and can pick up their thread pretty easily. He also has at his disposal a large team of bright assistants who would be eager to do all the preparatory research necessary for his writing a revised, updated and enlarged 4th edition, far superior to the 3d edition of 2004. Such a 4th edition of a revised ZEBRAS certainly would have a wide reception from a market of modern readers constantly harassed by psychological stressors every day of their lives. There is no doubt that such a 4th edition of ZEBRAS would be of more immediate value to any ordinary reader among the millions of modern humans seeking their balance in our complex industrial and scientific world with its fragmented and disruptive social structure. And to whoever is animated by a personal desire to improve the lot of mankind, this 4th edition would be much more meaningful, and have much more of an effective impact than any other project, grand as it might be, that Prof. Sapolsky could still envisage.

Stress becomes a nuisance, even a danger, if the zebra happens to keep brooding the day after about how close he was to death, and what mistake did he do to get himself in that terrible situation, and what's wrong with his sense of detecting danger, and starts feeling like a failure in the zebra world, etc... when he is supposed to be gamboling again with with his friends.

That is not the point. However, in many passages, he explicity says that a lot of questions remain open, like in any field of research, and that we have to wait a little longer to  see things more clearly. In the past 20 years since the 3d ed. a huge amount of  new literature has been published that could, in fact should, easily be integrated in the text of the 3d ed. It is a matter of increasing, enlarging, elucidating, adding details only recently evidenced, etc. rather than emending or replacing. Already, in BEHAVE (2017), there's a good amount of additions, clarifications, detailing of subjects covered in the 3d ed. of the Zebras book of 2004. The 4th ed. will be richer, more detailed, more up-to-date, and with some brand-new points as well. I wrote directly to Prof. Sapolsky to urge him, as his most effective contribution to the pursuit of happiness of millions, to tackle this 4th ed. now that he has the time and before it's too late. To the mass of ordinary people in our modern world, his book on stress is a far better help to our search for understanding our everyday psyche. than a  grandiose, encyclopedic treatise like BEHAVE embracing the whole time frame of evolution. But, for this researcher's own personal satisfaction, his pride and reputation as a known scientist making a splash in academia, BEHAVE is much more effective. Now that his ambition has been taken care of, I hope he finds in himself the force and the nerve to tackle a 4th edition of the stress book. He might be even working on it right now. The negative factor is that he may be, if not bored,, but tired of revisiting a too well-known field of stress. He mentions many times that he now realizes that his fascination for glucocorticoids (cortisol), the hippocampus and the amygdala in the first 30 years of his career kept him away from the \"really\" interesting field of the frontal cortex. He repeated this in the big book BEHAVE: \"I think I might have made the wrong choice back then \u2014 maybe I should have studied the frontal cortex all those years. Because it's the most interesting part of the brain\" (p.45). To his insatiably curious mind, new subjects are more exciting and challenging. So I doubt that he will now devote his time to focusing on stress again and produce a 4th edition.

For example, sometimes one neuron releases 2  types NT that have effects working at 2 different timeframes.\r  - Regulation of the glucocorticoid system @9:56 We've seen before the chain:  Hypothalamus neuron --CRH--> pituitary gland --ACTH--> adrenal cortex --> cortisol production --> feedback regulation. Another hormone (e.g. oxytocine) sentir to the anterior pituitary will lead to the release of another hormone to a distant gland. In fact, it's more complex than that: a) @11:54 Various neurotransmitters can release the same hormone (e.g. ACTH) but with disctinct shapes of secretory curve  b) @21:54 Cells in the pituitary gland aren't grouped by produced hormones. It's more like a mosaic --> modulation of sensitiveness due to neighborhood c) @25:00 Negative feedback is not the only system used to regulate hormones levels, neurons also have their own auto-regulation (pre-synaptic receptor) d) @30:40 Regulation can be done by checking that the hormone levels have reached the desired threshold but also by measuring the rate of change of these levels\r  @36:00 Regulation is as important as the effect of the hormones. A ill-regulation can lead to adult onset diabetes: the pancreas produces insuline to stare glucose from blood into fat cells. Fat cells become less sensitive to insuline because they're already full. Pancreas produces more insuline. Fat cells become even less sensitive.

So checked on. i was in full grand mal seizure. she called an ambulance which are free in Japan, not $1,000.00 like  in the US. My lips turned  blue and then purple. i  wasn't aware my wife was  pumping on my chest giving me a CPR heart massage. She said she held me to try and prevent me from shaking. i fell half way off the bed. my  feet got wedged under the dog pen's wooden rungs. The EMTs entered and broke the dog pen rung. and carried me out  to the ambulance. My wife said a random person walking by saw them loading me into the ambulance and  the person walking by said \"Gaijin!?\" (Foreigner?!) Yeah. i'm an American, from the Bay Area, i'm a Sunnyvalian. i've been in Japan  about 19 years now. Japan is an amazing place. Japan is a very quiet and peaceful, only once you get out of Tokyo or Osaka. i regained consciousness from black dreamless sleep in the ambulance with sirens blaring. and a medical masked and uniformed Japanese EMTwas looking down  on me. \"Doko desuka?\" (Where am i?) i asked. The EMT responded \"Kyukyusha\"(ambulance). He was a man of few words. Fycompa has made me rather talkative, my wife has pointed out to me like 2 months later. i asked \"Nani ga okottano?\" (What happened?) '\"Ohkeiren\" (Big cramps?) My wife  who was sitting by the back doors of the ambulance next to the other EMT also answered \"you had big seizure.\" My wife's a Filapina who's been in Japan for 30 years.   i felt like i had been hit by a truck and my body felt all lactic acidity as if i had been liftng weights at the gym. i have MELAS Syndrome. It's kind of how i know  about Dr. Enns in Pediatrics Genetics at Stanford University Medical Hospital. My family in America see him.
