They really helped. What my question really was, is that WHY do all that to find the number of bonding electrons ? In PH3, for example Hydrogen can only make single bonds and hence it is evident that there will be 3 phosphorous - hydrogen bonds and thus 2 x 3 = 6 bonding electrons. I really don't understand the purpose of doing all that calculation for this result. More over I guess you both used octet and duplet rules to find out the number of bonding electrons. Actually octet rule doesn't hold in all cases --> what I mean by that is 'there are many compounds which violate octet rule' for example SF6, XeF6, ... and the list goes on. Thus, I think using something that isn't ALWAYS true is not very very good. This method would fail in cases like XeF6. The only way in which you can find the number of bonding electrons is this ;- F makes single bonds thus 6 F atoms would make 6 bonds and thus there would be 12 bonding electrons.
