So the same number of molecules now spreads out into a slightly larger volume and hence a lower density.  When higher pressure is applied to a substance it will tend to occupy a lower volume (we see the extreme of this for gases but to a much, much smaller extent also for solids and liquids).  But if the conditions are very close to the solid-liquid line of equilibrium higher pressure could also lead to a phase change favoring whichever phase takes up a smaller volume (i.e. whichever is more dense).
