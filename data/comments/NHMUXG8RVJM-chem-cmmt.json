Is Urms only applicable to monoatomic gases since Ek=3/2RT is only valid for them? The example exercise in the video is about O2 though, and that definitely (at least to my limited knowledge) is not a monatomic. I'm not clear whether there are limitations to the application of the equation Urms=sqr[(3RT)/M] other than the gas being \"ideal\". Other than that, doesn't U stand for Internal Energy? So vrms=Urms in a gas (and maybe beyond that)?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "NHMUXG8RVJM", "cid": "UgxYlbnBkH7ua7LjHR54AaABAg", "comment": "Really nice class", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "NHMUXG8RVJM", "cid": "Ugzz8PHDHbp1T0GiA7Z4AaABAg", "comment": "Best explanation I've seen anywhere on the web.

First, you should definitely buy the ACS General Chemistry Study Guide: http://www.examsinstitute.com/s.nl/sc.11/category.190/.f They also have a practice test if you're taking the full year version, but not for the 1st term only. After that I would highly recommend the Final Exam Rapid Reviews that are included in my General Chemistry Master Course: https://courses.chadsprep.com/courses/general-chemistry-1-and-2 The rapid reviews for the 1st term topics appear after chapter 13 in my course.  All of the 1st term topics summarized in about 6 hours and a practice final exam. The rapid reviews for the 2nd term topics are covered after chapter 21, being summarized in about 5 hours.  Three practice final exams (covering both 1st and 2nd terms) follow.
