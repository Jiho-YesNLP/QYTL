Mostly due to not putting in any real effort but I came back years later (I'm 34 years old now) with a new mind and ability to study and apply myself and it all clicks. Never give up on studying/learning, it's an ongoing process for many. I think I'd also like to learn to code one day.

I'm planning on using this video over the span of 3 days, maybe 2 if I am that determined, but wow. This video also made me crave math. I actually enjoyed doing math for the first time, and I hope to enjoy it even more. I LOVE how it also shows the logical reasoning behing the expressions in the video which helped me better understand it, and not just memorize different rules and formulas. Once I am finished, I will go onto Precalculus and so on throughout the playlist. I also want to do programming, and this channel is like a wombo combo with what I'm learning. I want to learn Python, C#, Java, and so many more languages, and this channel just has it all. Subbed for more awesome videos. I just want to say after all of my words is just thank you.

In the 4th grade (and a little in the third) we learned Calculus. This applies to High schools where math is taught all four years. I attended Gymnasium and my sister attended Medical school, so we both learned it like this, the only difference is that I learned it in much more details (I had 4 math classes per week, while she had 2).
