In Python I often wonder if a variable in initialized or just reassigned right know.  2: the Compiler knows that it isn't possible to put a String inside my int variable and prints an error notice. In Python it doesn't because values are not really stored in variables but the variables point to the value that is stored somewhere else. so something like this is possible too: zahl = 3 print(zahl)    // prints 3 zahl = 'hello' print(zahl)   // prints hello  I think that this is a Problem if I have a method avaiting a string or even another method and it gets an integer or something. catching exceptions is all good and stuff, but with this kind of workflow I would have to put every line of code in Try and catch blocks.   that are reasons why I would start with either Java or C#", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "4dqlSk_RPmI", "cid": "Ugz1roSONIkiEbyhF4J4AaABAg", "comment": "Continue these series!
