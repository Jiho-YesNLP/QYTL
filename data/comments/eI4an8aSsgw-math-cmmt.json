Odd functions: f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. 35:08 \ud83d\udcc8 Even function example: f(x) = x\u00b2 + 3. Even both algebraically and symmetrically. 35:30 \ud83d\udcc9 Odd function example: f(x) = 5x - 1 / x. Odd both algebraically and symmetrically. 43:49 \ud83d\udd04 Transformations of functions: Outside changes affect y-values (vertical motions), inside changes affect x-values (horizontal motions). 50:24 \ud83d\udd04 Translations (adding/subtracting) affect y-values, horizontal shifts in opposite direction from sign. 54:35 \ud83d\udcd0 The rules for transformations of functions: Outside numbers affect vertical motions, inside numbers affect horizontal motions. Adding and subtracting correspond to shifts, multiplying and dividing correspond to stretches and shrinks. Negative sign corresponds to reflection. 55:48 \ud83d\udcc8 Piecewise functions are defined in pieces by different rules for different x values. Calculating values for piecewise functions involves applying the appropriate rule based on the given x. 59:21 \ud83d\udd00 Continuity of piecewise functions: Functions with transitions between different rules often have discontinuities at the transition points. 01:01:44 \ud83d\udd01 The graph of an inverse function is obtained by reflecting the graph of the original function over the line y = x. 01:05:37 \ud83d\udd04 Systematic method for finding inverses: Reverse roles of y and x, solve for y, and express the result as the inverse function. 01:07:24 \u274c Not all functions have inverses. A function must be one-to-one (satisfy horizontal line test) to have an inverse. 01:14:49 \ud83d\udcd0 Conversion between degrees, minutes, and seconds. 1 degree = 60 minutes, 1 minute = 60 seconds. 01:19:01 \ud83d\udd01 Conversion between decimal degrees and degrees, minutes, and seconds involves unit conversions based on ratios. 01:23:54 \ud83d\udcd0 Arc length is determined by the ratio of the angle to the total angle of the circle, multiplied by the circumference. 01:25:04 \ud83d\udcd0 Arc length formula: length = angle (in radians) \u00d7 radius. Angle must be in radians. 01:27:28 \ud83d\udcd0 Area of sector formula: area = (angle / 2) \u00d7 radius^2. Angle must be in radians. 01:29:12 \ud83d\udccf Linear speed = angular speed \u00d7 radius for a rotating circle. 01:33:17 \ud83d\udcd0 Trig functions (sine, cosine, tangent) relate sides of a right triangle to its angles. 01:35:51 \ud83d\udcd0 Reciprocal trig functions (secant, cosecant, cotangent) are inverses of sine, cosine, tangent. 01:40:58 \ud83d\udcd0 Sine and cosine values for 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0 angles: 1/2, \u221a2/2, \u221a3/2. 01:51:12 \ud83d\udcd0 The definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent are based on right triangle ratios: sine = opposite/hypotenuse, cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse, tangent = opposite/adjacent. 01:52:32 \ud83c\udf00 Unit circle definition: cosine(theta) is the x-coordinate, sine(theta) is the y-coordinate, and tangent(theta) is y-coordinate/x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle at angle theta. 01:54:22 \ud83d\udd04 Periodic property: Sine and cosine values repeat with a period of 2\u03c0 (360 degrees), meaning sine(theta + 2\u03c0) = sine(theta) and cosine(theta + 2\u03c0) = cosine(theta). 01:55:43 \ud83d\udcd0 Pythagorean property: cosine(theta)^2 + sine(theta)^2 = 1, which originates from the Pythagorean Theorem applied to points on the unit circle. 02:02:18 \ud83d\udd0e Given sine(t) = -2/7 and t in quadrant III, cosine(t) is calculated as the negative square root of 45/7. 02:11:58 \u2699\ufe0f Shifting the graph: Adding or subtracting constants inside the function shifts the graph vertically. 02:17:30 \ud83d\udcc8 Understanding sinusoidal functions: Horizontal shifts, period adjustments, and amplitude changes in graphs of functions like y = a sin(bx - c) + d. 02:21:47 \ud83d\udcc9 Intuition for graphing tangent (tan) function: Relating slope of a line on the unit circle to the tangent graph, vertical asymptotes, undefined slopes, and periodicity of pi. 02:26:20 \ud83d\udd04 Graphing secant (sec) and cosecant (csc) functions: Converting from cosine and sine, vertical asymptotes, period, range, and domain. 02:37:57 \ud83d\udd04 Graphing transformations of tangent, secant, cotangent, and cosecant: Effects of amplitude changes, period adjustments, vertical and horizontal shifts. 02:39:11 \u21a9\ufe0f Understanding inverse trigonometric functions: Relationship between original trig functions and their inverses, domain and range restrictions, notation (arc, inverse), and graphical interpretation. 02:46:17 \ud83d\udcd0 The restricted domain of tangent (tan) function is from -\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2, with vertical asymptotes at these endpoints. The range of restricted tan is from negative infinity to infinity. 02:48:41 \ud83e\uddea Sine inverse (arc sine), cosine inverse (arc cosine), and tangent inverse (arc tangent) functions were introduced as inverse trig functions. 02:53:29 \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Solving trig equations involves isolating the trig function, finding principal solutions in a given interval, then adding multiples of the function's period for all solutions. 03:07:49 \u274c Not all equations are identities. An equation that holds for some values of the variable is not an identity. 03:15:34 \ud83d\udd01 Pythagorean identity holds across different quadrants through symmetry. 03:41:22 \ud83d\udcd0 We derived the half angle formulas for cosine and sine: cos(\u03b8/2) = \u00b1\u221a((cos\u03b8 + 1)/2) and sin(\u03b8/2) = \u00b1\u221a((1 - cos\u03b8)/2). 03:42:41 \ud83d\udd0d Given sine \u03b8 = 4/5 and \u03b8 in the second quadrant (\u03c0/2 to \u03c0), we found exact values: cos(\u03b8/2) = 1/\u221a5 and sin(\u03b8/2) = 2/\u221a5. 03:48:56 \ud83d\udccf Given one side and one angle in a right triangle, we used tangent to find the other side, and Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse. 03:51:11 \ud83d\udcd0 Solved triangles using side-side-side (SSS) and side-angle-side (SAS) using Law of Cosines and trigonometric functions. 04:05:20 \ud83d\udccf Applied Law of Cosines to find side length and angles in a triangle with known side lengths. 04:17:44 \ud83d\udcd0 Equations of a parabola: The equations y - k squared = 4px - h and x - h squared = 4py - k define parabolas. They're shifted by (h, k), and the distance |p| represents focus-vertex and vertex-directrix distances. 04:34:57 \ud83e\udd47 Ellipse equation and relationships: Ellipses elongated horizontally: x\u00b2/a\u00b2 + y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1. Relationship: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 (major, minor axis, focus-vertex distance). 04:37:12 \ud83d\udccc Equations for ellipses elongated vertically have x and y roles reversed, involving shifts in both directions. 04:37:41 \ud83c\udf1f Key points like vertices and foci can be labeled and calculated for ellipses with shifted centers. 04:39:24 \ud83d\udd35 The distance definition of a hyperbola involves the constant difference of distances to its foci. 04:42:12 \ud83c\udf00 Hyperbolas can have horizontal or vertical transverse axes, affecting their orientation like lying down or standing up. 04:43:34 \ud83d\udccf Hyperbolas' equations differ based on their orientation, involving parameters A, B, and C representing distances. 04:45:15 \u2699\ufe0f Formulas for distances to foci and vertices help derive hyperbolic equations, with A, B, and C being related quantities. 04:46:37 \ud83d\udcca Hyperbolas' slopes and equations of asymptotes depend on A and B, creating guidelines for drawing the curves. 04:49:27 \u2712\ufe0f The conversion between polar and Cartesian coordinates involves trigonometric equations and understanding angles and radii. 05:00:16 \ud83d\udd04 Polar coordinates allow points to be represented with radius and angle, with adjustments for negative radii and angles. 05:02:27 \ud83d\udcc8 Parametric equations enable the description of curves using separate functions for x and y in terms of a third variable, often time. 05:02:54 \ud83d\udcca Parametric equations relate x and y to a third variable called the parameter, and graphing them involves finding corresponding x and y values for a given parameter value. 05:04:41 \ud83d\udd35 Graphs like circles on the xy-plane can be described by parametric equations (e.g., x = cos(t), y = sin(t)), and their Cartesian equation is often derived using trigonometric identities. 05:05:50 \u2b55 Unit circles with radius 1 are described by x^2 + y^2 = 1 in Cartesian coordinates, and this equation can be parameterized using x = cos(t) and y = sin(t). 05:08:57 \ud83d\udd22 Parametric equations can also be created from given Cartesian equations, like parameterizing curves using x = t or other equations based on trigonometric functions. 05:11:07 \ud83d\udccd The equation of a circle centered at (h, k) with radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, and parametric equations for circles are derived by scaling and shifting unit circle parametric equations. 05:12:49 \u2696\ufe0f Difference quotient and average rate of change concepts relate to the derivative and calculus, where average rate of change represents the slope of secant lines between two points on a function graph.

Even though you might know algebra, you have to be really good at it, since most calculus problems have an algebraic foundation in a way.   Are there vids you could watch before doing this? Yes.  Are there vids that could teach you more in-depth stuff? Absolutely.  But these are good because they're simple. Straight to the point and cover most of what any college will teach you.

Think about it like this. All the videos combined and roughly 25 hours. If you take time to do an hour a day, you'll be good. I guess long term advice is just to remember a couple things 1. These videos are supposed to familiarize you with Calculus, not make you a pro, so don't beat yourself up if you don't get everything in one month (talking from experience). It's highly unlikely you'll get EVERYTHING that's said so just take pride in the fact that you are familiar with the content so when you get to college it'll be easier to understand, you'll have more time to make connections and you won't be NEARLY as stressed as most STEM students.  Also, in your first semester, don't take more than 15 credits. I don't what school you're going to, but I can promise you, you're gonna wanna meet people and explore places on campus, and if you have a crap load of credits to do, you won't do any of that and you'll feel alone really quick.
