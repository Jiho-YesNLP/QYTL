Since we know that b=[1, 0, 0] has no solution in Ax=b, it must mean it's the former case. To answer this question means reversing the reasoning here. Starting with the fact that b has no solution and deducing from there that r is less than m.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RWvi4Vx4CDc", "cid": "Ugx4_FL1rjHyk1Y8_Tx4AaABAg", "comment": "It's a little more into matrix theory than that. He's assuming that we've already done the elimination process, and if there were any repeated equation while eliminating, it would yield an entire row of just 0's -that is, no pivot. So in essence saying that there's no pivot in one of the columns is the same as saying that one of the equations was repeated. The rank, r, is the number of pivots, m the number of rows. So if r<m, there must be a column without pivots, and the solution is not unique.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "RWvi4Vx4CDc", "cid": "UgzPHlMCGppUnLsPVhx4AaABAg.8GcTnV2uU-W9HqjUoxvn91", "comment": "I do not want to upset my teacher but ..., yeah, Strang was really the person who has taught me the most", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "RWvi4Vx4CDc", "cid": "UgzPHlMCGppUnLsPVhx4AaABAg.8GcTnV2uU-W9IxMqki0anP", "comment": "What are  the prerequisites in order to take this course ?
