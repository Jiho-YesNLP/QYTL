A constrained min/max is the minimum or maximum of a function with the caveat that there is a given set of points described by a constraint, described by g = c. Now why is the directional derivative in the direction tangent to g = c zero. Well imagine you look at the function f in 3d dimensions (f(x,y)), and then draw the level curve g = c under that. Now look at how the point on constrained min/max f in 3d dimensions and look at that same point on the translated down to the xy plane on g= c. You will see that because the min/max is only being compared to points on g = c, then on the function f in the direction tangent to g=c at the min/max that the curve is flat because all the other points on g = c are either lower than that max or greater than it. Basically you are observing a cross section of f that is in the shape of g = c and seeing that the constrained min/max will either be the highest or lowest point on that cross section, this making the slope at that point  in the direction of the cross section 0 .This also applies for higher dimensions as well, but just MUCH harder to visualize.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "15HVevXRsBA", "cid": "UgxxKrszevQJhCXn_g14AaABAg.8GcNYLPhwsS9x-syh_7vqz", "comment": "This is how I understand.
