Represent knowledge with data structures / Iteration and Recursion as computational metaphors, 2. Abstraction of procedures and data types / Organise and modularise systems using object classes and methods 3. Different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting / Complexity of algorithms.  7:03 - What does a computer do? Performs calculation, remembers results.  What kind of calc? built-in to the language, one that you define as the programmer. It only know what you tell them.  8:44 - Types of knowledge. 1. Declarative knowledge - Statement of fact 2. Imperative knowledge is a recipe or \"how-to\"  Imperative programming: telling \"How to do it\" and Declarative programming: telling \"What we want to happen\" without telling how  14:37 - What is a recipe: 1. Sequence of simple steps 2. Flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed. 3. a means of determining when to stop.  15:55 - Two types of computer - 1. fixed program computer - calculator. 2. Stored program computer - machine stores and executes instruction.   17:33 - Basic machine architecture : 1. Memory(Bunch of data, sequence of instructions), 2. CPU(ALU - primitive ops, CU - program counter), Input and Output  20:04 - Sequence of instructions stored inside computer: primitive instructions - arithmetic and logic, simple tests and moving data. Special program (interpreter) executes each instruction in order - use tests to change flow of control through sequence, stop when done  20:39 - Turning showed that you can compute anything using 6 primitives - Read, Write, Move left, Move right, Scan and Do nothing. Modern programming languages have more convenient set of primitives. Can abstract methods to create new primitives. Anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language.   21:58 - a programming language provides a set of primitive operations, expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language.   22:58 - syntactically invalid , static semantic error  24:52 - Semantics - is the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors.   29:34 - Program manipulate data objects. Object have a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them.  Objects are scalar(cannot be subdivided) and non -scalar(have internal structure that can be accessed)   31:14 - Scalar objects - int -5, float - 3.27, bool , None. type()  34:22 - Combine objects and operators to form expressions. An expression has a value, which has a type. Syntax for a simpler expression : <object> <operator> <object>  35:29 - Operators on ints and floats: + - * / % **", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "nykOeWgQcHM", "cid": "UgzlvMSNBK4vI6ihMm54AaABAg", "comment": "Your promen bangladesh", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "nykOeWgQcHM", "cid": "UgzfyTXMq0pO5dIBo0V4AaABAg", "comment": "Sorry!
