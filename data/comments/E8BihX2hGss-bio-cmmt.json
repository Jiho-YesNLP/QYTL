Three months ago I was desperately searching for some helpful remedies for genital herpes (HSV 2) cure, when I came across some helpful remedies on how Dr. Sani have helped so many people in curing genital herpes (HSV 2) with some herbal treatment, I believe too that there is someone somewhere in the world who can cure herpes completely. In the past 2 months, however, I've been following his herpes protocol Via (perfectherbalcure@gmail.com) or WhatsApp: +2348118184266 and it stopped all outbreaks completely! To my greatest surprise I was cured completely by following the protocol of his herbal medicines. Don't be discouraged by the medical doctors. There is a cure for HSV with the help of herbs and roots by a herbal specialist called Dr Sani, he is so kind and truthful with his herbal treatments.

No one 100% knows where it originated from, so I don't see any reason for you to claim as if you know the answer.   Most scientists theorize that the place of origin is likely to be in the United States, specifically from a US Army training camp, as there is consistent data linking its origin to the training camps. Other virologists and epidemiologists linked it to British Army camps in mainland Europe, so this is still a disputed topic. The origin is unknown, and there are a few hypotheses surrounding the virus' origin, but it is well established through research that it is unlikely that the virus originated from Asia.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "E8BihX2hGss", "cid": "UgxzjYf4MUN0siANU854AaABAg.9SvMhh82aCx9WuecKF83d6", "comment": "It isn't, and to this day, we still calculate genetic drift mutations in seasonal flu based on samples from Asia.

Genetic drift has nothing to do with the origins of a virus. And if you want to play the smartass game, then the proper term is called antigenic drift. Both has more to do with the evolution of an organism or a virus than the origin itself. The response is even more brain damaging when you know what genetic drift means. Genetic drift is not something that you \"calculate\", it is something that you observe. For example, there is one species of squirrel with two phenotypes: black fur and brown fur. One day, a group of poachers eliminated 90% of the squirrels that exhibit the black phenotype, and as a result causes a loss of genetic variation in that population. This is what genetic drift is, but more specifically, it represents the bottleneck effect. Bringing up genetic drift in an argument that questions the origins of a virus poses absolutely NO relevance.   2. \"Failed propaganda\" If scientific hypotheses are propaganda to you, then I'm afraid I can no longer continue this discussion with you. It's obvious you are politically motivated behind that statement, and there is no reason to include unnecessary politics that again, poses no relevance to the topic at hand. Do note that \"British army camps in mainland Europe\" came from an article published in Oxford Academic. And not to mention, a quick google search says that \"Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe\", so I really don't know what you're smoking.   Have a good day; no point in continuing this discussion when you include information that poses no relevance to your original statement. This also serves as a reminder to do your research, because clearly it's lacking.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "E8BihX2hGss", "cid": "UgxzjYf4MUN0siANU854AaABAg.9SvMhh82aCx9ZHH-mv4fTt", "comment": "\u00a0@tomato-v8x\u00a0 Oh ok buddy.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "E8BihX2hGss", "cid": "Ugw8-BF8USv_3IR94HZ4AaABAg.9Ig_tXINR7V9PbszPAXFLS", "comment": "haha i had a good chuckle as well", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
