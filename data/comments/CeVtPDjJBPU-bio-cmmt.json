Or maybe the opposite, it is supposed to supply this ammount of protien, but it supplies a little less, thus something being weaker.

To change the function of the strand scientists have group every three letters and give them names. Search DNA codes to now what I am going to explain next.(don't confuse it with RNA.). Lets say the DNA sequence is : GATAATCGCTGA. First we divide them into groups of three. GAT AAT CGC TGA. Then we translate them using the DNA codes: asp-asn-arg-stop. the matching strand is: GATAATTAATGA. Again we divide them: GAT AAT TAA TGA translation: asp-asn-stop-stop.

Some will produce it and thus look like normal cells to the immune system, and so go undetected. This can be changed if the immune system is hyped up by another infection and then goes into overdrive, in which case it can sometimes see through the trick and kill the cells anyway. Cancer cells also have many ways to defend themselves or make themselves immune to signals from NKs and other cells telling them to commit suicide (ie: undergo apoptosis). With regard to the DNA in each cancer cell being different, this also isn't necessarily true, but what is more important is the proteins it produces and how it can avoid being killed or committing suicide. The ways in which it does these is the basis on which it is treated and these are DNA dependent (and thus for the most part protein dependent). Look up \"6 hallmarks of cancer\" for a better overview. But the simplest way to put is that the DNA changes aren't the main issue its what happens due to these.

Most micro-organisms are actually neutral and don't give a fuck about us in any way because they have not evolved in such as way as to be able to infect our cells or even survive within the environment of our bodies.  Only a tiny minority of micro-organisms are actually helpful to us, most of them living in our digestive track and supplementing their ability to digest compounds that we cannot process ourselves in exchange for just the right amount of warmth and a sweet anaerobic environment. Delicious, amazing symbiosis.\u00a0And because they exist, and we like them, we do not wish to destroy them so long as they remain confined to the digestive system. They also help prevent infections by harmful pathogens simply be being there, taking up all the available space and nutrients.  If we killed all the bacteria of the world, which is currently an impossible feat for our species, even massive amounts of nuking wouldn't systematically destroy all of them, we would be utterly screwed not because we would suddenly lack a layer of protection against other pathogens (They would be all gone at that point) or because we would lack some digestive functions (We can live without their help, admittedly with some difficulty) but because without bacteria, the entire food chain goes bonkers and eventually, everything that is called life dies by starvation. Even plants would eventually run out of soil minerals to absorb in their immediate vicinity and because the multitude of organisms required to renew those soil minerals would be gone, the plants would wither and die. Sun and water is not enough, even for those.  However, I would like to point that we ARE the rulers of this world. And like all rulers, we depend on the existence of subjects to exist. We are the apex of the pyramid of life and bacteria are the base. A base can survive without the Apex, but the reverse is impossible, unless we somehow permanently defeat gravity. If humans were able to remove their obligation to constantly seek sustenance in the form of water, air, heat and food, then maybe we could exist for all eternity, but that would likely require \"Ascending to a higher state of existence that transcends the laws of the material\" or something, which is quite a ways off.  Still, we totally own the place, for now. But like any ruler, we can't just fuck with the people and hope to keep our heads. Are we are currently doing \u00a0A LOT of that. We have the means and perhaps some of us have the willingness to care for our planet, but sadly we are a ruling class of over 7 billions different opinions, and we cannot find a way to all agree on doing the right thing and thus, we are likely to herald our own horrible destruction.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "CeVtPDjJBPU", "cid": "UghV6ixMz-qNVXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-4g3T7-oDjv69hNC", "comment": "There probably wasn't enough time to explain Isotypes in detail.

They are very important parts of the innate immune system, they talk to the acquired immune system by antigen presentation and chemical messages (interleukin/cytokines) and can help do lots of things. -The acquired system is the B and T cells.

Macrophages and natural killer cells both kill infected cells, but they do it differently. A macrophage will recognize, \"eat\" (a process called phagocytsosis), and destroy a bad cell by \"digesting\" it. A natural killer cell will bind to a bad cell and commit suicide (a process called apoptosis), thus killing itself and the bad cell. Also, macrophages \"eat\" these cells that have undergone apoptosis. -Cancer cells? Natural killer cells can kill cancer cells. That's a clear yes. Macrophages... not so clear. Most cancers have a \"don't eat me\" signal, so macrophages don't eat them and this helps with tumor growth. However, there is an antibody that blocks the \"don't eat me\" signal, which then allows the macrophage to eat it.This is according to the latest research.
