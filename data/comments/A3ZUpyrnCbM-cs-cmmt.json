You even mention that if you run out of space with your array you'd have to create a new array, one of its key limitations. I also find moving the pointer reference to a different index while keeping the value in place instead of actually popping the value to be an awkward representation of popping the top value of the stack", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "A3ZUpyrnCbM", "cid": "UgzBnp5XlZPZxJO-Z894AaABAg", "comment": "Please try to stop using \"ahhhh\"", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "A3ZUpyrnCbM", "cid": "Ugyq9IOwnhYcDAcVHoB4AaABAg", "comment": "01:51", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "A3ZUpyrnCbM", "cid": "UgzppzUWmwfn5C0zqop4AaABAg", "comment": "csdojo you the boy", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "A3ZUpyrnCbM", "cid": "UgzYwl14dnLQHXwB2nF4AaABAg", "comment": "thank u bro!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "A3ZUpyrnCbM", "cid": "UgzMHabI1sXPpFrCIwJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Here is my Deque class (in java) if someone needs example  public class CustomDeque {\r     private Integer[] dequeArray;\r     private int count;\r     private int max;\r     private int leftIndex;\r     private int rightIndex;\r \r     public CustomDeque(int length) {\r         dequeArray = new Integer[length]; //this array can be int if you don't need to store null values\r         count = 0;\r         max = length;\r         leftIndex = 0;\r         rightIndex = 1;\r     }\r \r     public void addLeft(int data) {\r         if (count >= max) {\r             System.out.println(\"Deque is full\");\r             return;\r         }\r \r         dequeArray[leftIndex--] = data;\r         leftIndex = indexBounds(leftIndex);\r         count++;\r     }\r \r     public void addRight(int data) {\r         if (count >= max) {\r             System.out.println(\"Deque is full\");\r             return;\r         }\r \r         dequeArray[rightIndex++] = data;\r         rightIndex = indexBounds(rightIndex);\r         count++;\r     }\r \r     public Integer popLeft() {\r         if (count == 0) {\r             System.out.println(\"Deque is empty\");\r             return null;\r         }\r         leftIndex = indexBounds(++leftIndex);\r         count--;\r         int result = dequeArray[leftIndex];\r         //no need to empty values.
