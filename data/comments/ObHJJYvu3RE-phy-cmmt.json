The power rule is more than just a weird trick, it is provable mathematical truth. the proof relies on the \"limit definition of derivative\" which is the limit as h (just a variable) approaches 0 of ( ( (f(x+h) - f(x) ) )/h) ) now that junk there basically means you are finding the slope of the secant line that passes through an ever decreasing interval, which gives you the slope of the tangent line. with our function x^n, the lim. def. der. gives us \"lim as h->0  ( ( (x+h)^n - x^n ) )/h) ) \". okay taking a step back for a moment we see that we need to fully expand the binomial (x+h)^n. as n increases the expansion of (x+h)^n has coefficients that follow pascals triangle, so the first two and last two in the expansion will be x^n + nx^(n-1)h ... nh^(n-1) + h^n. in our lim def der of x^n \"lim as h->0  ( ( (x+h)^n - x^n ) )/h) ) \" we now have \"lim as h->0  ( ( x^n + nx^(n-1)h ... nh^(n-1) + h^n - x^n ) )/h) ) \" which looks terrible but simplifies to \"lim as h->0  ( ( nx^(n-1)h ... nh^(n-1) + h^n ) )/h) ) \" and now we can factor out an h from the numerator and simplify with the h in the denominator and we get \"lim as h->0  ( nx^(n-1) ... nh^(n-2) + h^(n-1)) )\". now from here we just plug in 0 for h and we get that the derivative of x^n = nx^(n-1). you can find a much clearer proof somewhere else, but this is the best I could do with the Youtube comments", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "Ugxe35zsTMj9bfir64Z4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgwaAtF1dibTyCQYTmd4AaABAg", "comment": "d cos x = -sin x d -sin x= -cos x d -cos x = sin x", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgycZIaLdNh49ijyXxx4AaABAg", "comment": "I don't think I've ever felt so dumb in my entire life.

Label the long side opposite from the right angle C, and label the other sides A and B.

Call this angle 'Q' (or whatever you like really).  We define the quantity sin(Q) (read: sine of Q) as the ratio of the line opposite to Q to the hypotenuse of the triangle, i.e. sin(Q) = A/C.  We define the quantity cos(Q) (cosine of Q) as the ratio of the line adjacent to Q to the hypotenuse: cos(Q) = B/C.  That's all sin and cos mean; they are defined simply as these ratios.    We often talk about the sine and cosine of an angle (call it P) that is not explicitly drawn as part of a right triangle. When doing this, we can imagine drawing a right triangle like the one above containing the angle P.  Note that since the sum of the angles in a triangle must equal 180 degrees, and since two of the angles are specified (the angle in question, P, and the right angle which is 90 degrees), we know what the third angle must be by subtracting P and 90 degrees from 180.  Since we are only concerned with finding the ratios of the sides of these angles, it doesn't matter what the actual lengths of the sides of the triangles are, so we can draw our triangle so that the side adjacent to P has whatever length we like.  Then using the geometry of triangles, we can figure out what the lengths of the other sides must be. We can then finally take the appropriate ratios to find the sine and cosine of P.  This is in principle how one might calculate the sine or cosine of an arbitrary angle, but it is very tedious so we would normally just ask a calculator to figure it out for us, or in the days before calculators consult a lengthy table of trigonometric values.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UggkobnLmXSEpXgCoAEC", "comment": "i am SOO LOST", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgjCOJQ-lFuVbXgCoAEC", "comment": "you.... are.... annoying", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgjyhmTJD8Tpr3gCoAEC", "comment": "How do I still have a license", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgjDNUVhcOxgiHgCoAEC", "comment": "I will never understand those that do math for fun", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgjS8qQntJe41XgCoAEC", "comment": "Another engaging and to the point video.

Derivatives are a type of Limit. Derivatives helps solving two main problems. (1) Finding the tangent line to a curve. (2) Finding the velocity of an object.  {The tangent line to a curve y = f(x) at the point P(a, f(a)) (<- that means a point in a graph,  where a is the value in the x-axis and f(a) the value in the y-axis) is the line through P with SLOPE m:  m = Lim ( x -> a ) of [ f(x) \u2013 f(a) ] / [ x \u2013 a ] That is read as \u2018m\u2019 equals the \u2018limit\u2019 of \u2018f(x)\u2019 minus \u2018f(a)\u2019, all of that divided by \u2018x\u2019 minus \u2018a\u2019, as \u2018x\u2019 approaches \u2018a\u2019.} {EXEMPLE: The slope of the tangent line to y = x\u00b2 at the point P (1, 1)  a = 1  f(x) = x\u00b2 m = Lim (x->1) of [ f(x) \u2013 f(1) ] / [ x \u2013 1] m = Lim (x->1) of [ x\u00b2 - 1\u00b2 ] / [ x \u2013 1] m = Lim (x->1) of [ (x \u2013 1) * (x + 1) ] / [x \u2013 1]   Note: (x \u2013 1) * (x + 1) =  x\u00b2 - 1 m = Lim (x->1) of [x + 1]                                  Note: (x-1)/(x-1) = 1 m = 1 + 1          Note: put the \u201ca\u201d value in the \u201cx\u201d, so that a = x. m = 2   Note: this is the slope of the tangent line that intersects with f(x) = x\u00b2 only at the                        point P (1, 1).  Extra: To find the tangent line: y \u2013 y1 = m * ( x \u2013 x1 ) where y1 is the y value of the point P, and x1 is the x value of the point P. So y \u2013 1 = 2 * ( x \u2013 1) y = 2 * ( x \u2013 1 ) + 1 Note: Isolate y. y = 2x \u2013 2 + 1 y = 2x \u2013 1  Note: This is the tangent line that intersects x\u00b2 at P (1, 1).}  \u2003 Derivatives: The derivative of the function f at a number a, f \u2019(a), is Let h = x \u2013 a f \u2018 (x) = Lim ( h -> 0 ) of [ f( a + h ) \u2013 f(a) ] / h  Note: f\u2019(x), means \u201cf prime of x\u201d. Alternate form: f \u2018 (x) = Lim ( x -> a ) of [ f(x) \u2013 f(a) ] / [ x \u2013 a ] Alternate formula to find the Tangent line: y \u2013 f(a) = f\u2019(a) * (x \u2013 a)  Derivative as rate of change: \u2206x = x2 \u2013 x1  \u2206y = y2 \u2013 y1     Note: just defined some variables, \u2206 is \u2018delta\u2019. The instantaneous rate of change is Lim (\u2206x -> 0) of  \u2206y / \u2206x = [y2 \u2013 y1] / [ x2 \u2013 x1]  The derivative f\u2019(a) is the instantaneous rate of change of y = f(x) with respect to x when x = a.  So as you see, it may take some time to calculate a derivative, so as the lady said, mathematicians found patterns and created shortcuts to make it faster. The more used rule would be the Power Rule.   There are two notations for derivatives: \u03b4x / \u03b4y   Leibnitz\u2019s Notation. \u03b4 is a delta, small. f\u2019(x)  Newton\u2019s Notation. Reads, f prime of x.    Velocity is the derivative of Position.   V = P\u2019 Acceleration is the derivative of Velocity.  A = V\u2019  Sorry if I confused you even more.

Like for instance, let&#39;s look at speed. When I change my speed once, and immediately, then there was no derivative, because my speed had changed, but the time hadn&#39;t. It happened so quickly that my speed had changed but at that very instant My speed went from 0 to 100 in 0 seconds, basically, so 100/0 = 0, and if it was plotted on a graph, it would be a line that changes its gradient at some point immediately.  But if my speed changed periodically, in other words if I was accelerating, my speeds would have changed from 0 to 4, then 4 to 9, then 9 to 63, then 63 to 100, if I plotted that on a graph, it would be a curve, so doing distance/time to get the speed would be only an approximation, that gets more accurate and accurate as I make the changes smaller. Problem is, it&#39;s too much work that doesn&#39;t even lead to the real answer  This is where the derivative comes in, as it basically sums up all those small changes and allows me to find the EXACT speed at a certain time. For example, by doing that laborious work, my answers would be like 8.00000000000000043 m/s, but with the derivative, I can get the EXACT speed and have 8 m/s.  I know it seems like there&#39;s no point of all that, but it&#39;s very helpful in situations where physicists are trying to work with really small changes in space, or bullets or whatever it may be.

And, believe it or not, I enjoy learning in this way.  I was terrible at math in school. Even basic math. It wasn't until I was an adult and playing around with a number-based constructed writing system called 12480 ( http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/12480.htm ) that something clicked in my head and I could suddenly add, subtract, and multiply in base 16 MUCH easier than I ever could in base 10, because I had formed a dynamic understanding of it. I managed to translate that over to base 10 in my head with a little mental gymnastics.  I've since used similar strategies to help me learn more math better, but it seems that such thinking strategies are unpopular and hard to come by. Putting them together myself from scratch can be painstaking, mostly because learning math the way other people do is so difficult for me.

So let's go back to the Newton quotient (explained at 4:05 in the video):  (sin(t + \u0394t) - sin t)/\u0394t  Now, a bit of trig will tell you that sin(t + \u0394t) = sin t * cos \u0394t + sin \u0394t * cos t (an easy-to-understand geometric proof of this identity can be found at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AngleAdditionDiagramSine.svg ).  So the above becomes  (sin t * cos \u0394t + sin \u0394t * cos t - sin t)/\u0394t = sin t * ((cos \u0394t - 1)/\u0394t) + cos t * (sin \u0394t/\u0394t)  Now, one way of looking at trig functions - in fact, the oldest way - is to think about the chords of twice the angle.  If you draw a radius through the midpoint of such a chord, and two more to each end, what you'll get is two congruent right triangles whose hypotenuses are the radius and one of whose angles is that in question.  If we define our units so that the radius is 1, the length of the chord becomes twice the sine, and the length of the radius drawn to the midpoint becomes the cosine, with the length to the arc along that radius becoming one minus the cosine.  Now, as has been known since ancient times, as the angle gets very small, the length of the chord will be very close to the length of the arc (if you're not convinced of this, connect the endpoints of the chord along tangent lines and consider that the ratio of the chord to the sum of these segments is the cosine of the original angle, which approaches one), which, since we've defined the radius to be 1, is by definition equal to the angle in radians (hence the term \"radian\").  The distance between the midpoints of the chord and the arc, meanwhile, will drop much more quickly than the length of the arc for essentially the same reason (if you're not convinced, consider that it's the height of the triangle formed by the aforementioned segments, and that its relationship to the chord is therefore half the tangent, which approaches zero).  In short, sin \u0394t/\u0394t goes to 1, and (cos \u0394t - 1)/\u0394t goes to 0, so the above formula becomes simply cos t.  To get the rest of the way, just use the identities cos t = sin (t + pi/2) and sin t = -cos (t + pi/2), which follow very quickly from the definition.  And what the hell, let's go on to the exponential function.  Now, I'm guessing most of you were vaguely aware before starting this video that there was a constant called e, so to strip away the baggage, let's forget we know the answer in advance and call it b.  Use the Newton quotient again:  (b^(t + \u0394t) - b^t)\u0394t = b^t*(b^\u0394t - 1)/\u0394t.  Now, we can pull b^t right out of the limit, so that leaves that other term, (b^\u0394t - 1)/\u0394t.  So let's write the equation...  z = (b^\u0394t - 1)/\u0394t \u2234 b = (z*\u0394t + 1)^(1/\u0394t)  Now, if z = 1, then the limit of the formula on the right, as \u0394t approaches zero, is one definition of e.  Since the actual value is just a matter of number crunching, I'm not going to bother to show what it is, only that it exists, so consider - let's consider only the values of \u0394t less than some value c, and you'll see they're bounded below by (z*c + 1)^(1/c) and above by (z*c+1)^(1/c+1), and the ratio between these two approaches 1.  Weirdly, even though it feels like it should be the most basic, I can't find a way to prove the power rule other than for integers that doesn't rely on half a semester of tricks.  So I'll just say for counting numbers it's basically just a matter of number-crunching ((t+\u0394t)^k - t^k)/\u0394t, and for negative integers it's slightly harder but basically the same idea.", "votes": "2", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "ObHJJYvu3RE", "cid": "UgjoWayzl1k0HngCoAEC", "comment": "I am LOVING and LIVING for this crash course so far!

Electrical engineering is one of those engineering fields that is known to have more math than most of other engineering disciplines. In my university, electrical engineering department is the only engineering department that has Calculus IV in its curriculum (I'll be damned if I ever know why mechanical engineering students don't have to take it!) (differential equations is a course of its own, for all).  Still, however, I find the \"dry\" Calculus rather abstract. It makes so much more sense when it is applied to more tangible stuff. And most of my math doctors/professors really lack that skill, relating math to more concrete substance. Differential equations started making sense only after taking circuits. Laplace started making sense only after Signals and Communication courses, (though still trying to wrap my head around it in the Control Theory), and so did the entire concept of orthogonal dimensions and their usefulness. The whole thing with the complex numbers... it is way easier to see them in the phasor realm, simply as value with angles or rotation, than in the Cartesian-style, terms of i's (j's in electrical engineering) as an extra...sign? Eh... Even in terms of j, it really makes more sense when the imaginary part denotes for example the magnitude of reactive power or the rotation of signal's phase, than merely an abstract (-1)^(1/2) = j  Mathematicians still like complicating things...

Catherine Duthie This \"mentality\" is why people fail at math, I know from personal experience:) Normal healthy people fail math for 2 reason in my opinion: 1. They give up too soon because it's scary(frustration, self-loathing and apathy sets in). 2. They missed some fundamentals at an earlier year, usually Algebra, and then they can't succeed no matter how hard they work, because the basics are missing.  You just have to be persistent. You don't have to work very hard, but you do have to work often. I guarantee you that if you spend 1-2 hours each day on math that is appropriate for your level, you will succeed. Because math builds heavily on what you have previously learned, so if you never got basic algebra, it will be almost impossible to succeed at higher levels, no matter how hard you work. You can't deal with derivations and integrals if you struggle to understand how for instance multiplication and signs work. As in: (Minus )  x  ( Minus ) =  Plus,   ( Minus )  x  ( Plus )  = Minus,  (Plus )  x  (Plus )  =  Plus. That stuff.  So if I were you, I'd go back to whatever level of math that does not frighten you, and you start from there. Luckily in this day and age there is so many helpful sites etc on the internet. I highly recommend you give https://www.khanacademy.org/ a go. That site have helped me so much when dealing with math, and especially chemistry. There you can learning at a level where you are literally counting apples! No, I'm not joking:) We're talking kindergarten stuff, and all the way up to Multivariable Calculus and all that craziness.

The way I learned about derivatives was the slope of a graph.  Some graphics showing this relationship might help explain what's going on.  You start from considering constant, non-zero velocity; first show the distance/time graph and how the velocity is the slope of the line on it, and then that the slope of the velocity graph is zero and thus that's the acceleration.  Then do it again for a constant acceleration, again showing how distance is the slope of the velocity graph is the slope of the acceleration graph.  THEN you start introducing the equations.

If f(t) = 7t^6, then its derivative is f'(t) = 42t^5 (This gives you the rate of change of f(t) at any instant).  For example, f(t) might represent position, and then f'(t) gives you the instantaneous rate of change of position - velocity.  In the end, it's not a question of which one's better to deal with because they are both useful for different reasons.

Here each high school has it's own curriculum, so some are more focused on physics/math, some are more focused on languages. The one I went to was more focused on Biology/chemistry. I never felt like I was missing much by not using derivatives. Of course our teacher mentioned that with derivatives you can do much more, but most people forgot the stuff after they wrote an exam on it, so why bother them with derivatives and shit.  Big problem was also \u00a0the fact that we learned derivatives in 4th year at the end of the year, while kinematics is done in the first months of first year so yeah.
