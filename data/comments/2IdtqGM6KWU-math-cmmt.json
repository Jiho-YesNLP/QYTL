In other words, to find the dimension of a matrix space, I might ask myself something like \"for how many entires of the matrix am I allowed to choose any value?\". In the case of 3x3 symmetric matrices, I can choose any values I like on the 3 diagonal entries because this will have no effect on the symmetry of the matrix, so that gives me 3 \"degrees of freedom\". I can also choose any values I like for the 3 entries above the diagonal, so there's another 3 \"degrees of freedom\". But at this point, I no longer have choices. If I want my matrix to be symmetric, my 3 entries below the diagonal MUST be the same as the 3 above the diagonal. So, in total, I have a freedom of choice over 6 total entries in the matrix and therefore, my matrix space has dimension = 6. (Note: I could have also chosen the 3 entries below the diagonal thereby fixing the 3 entries above as well).
