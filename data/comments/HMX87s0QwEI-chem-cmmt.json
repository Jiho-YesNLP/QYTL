Sorry for the late response but I have been away. Anyways  1) The only way you really know if a reaction is elementary is if you are told so. Otherwise, there is really no way of knowing this. Absolutely not. The law of mass action (the equilibrium constant, K) applies to both elementary as well as complex reactions.  2) Basically, the concentration of a pure solid or liquid is usually assumed to be 1 Molar for equilibirum", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "HMX87s0QwEI", "cid": "UgzXCCIy42Sfwvi86HN4AaABAg", "comment": "Very helpful video. I have been using your videos to help me learn the material I need to take the CLEP chemistry exam and they have proved to be explanatory and to the point. I understand chemical equilibrium now, but I have a few questions.   1) What determines if a reaction is elementary and does the law of mass action only apply to elementary reactions?  2)Why aren't solids & liquids included?
