He refers to them as the sysnthesis, degredation \"rates,\" but they seem to be treated as rate constants because he mentions that the average mRNA molecules per cell is the rate of mRNA synthesis/the rate of mRNA degredation. this would only make sense if he is refering to the rate constants where d[mRNA]/dt= synthesis rate - degredation rate. assuming steady state conditions synthesis rate = degredatin rate, sysn,thesis rate = the synthesis rate constant. degredation rate = the degredation rate constant times [mRNA], therefore the mRNA concentration at steady state [mRNA]= the synthesis rate constant/the degredation rate constant. Am I confused? correct me if you know the reasoning behind it.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "03bVGr-vYHQ", "cid": "Ugz0gLXkxU3oeNxI1vV4AaABAg.9oscELNm0oZ9sy3FqSI2Vo", "comment": "if rate = [conc] * rate constant, then he's talking in a normalized sense, as in in per unit conc, that is, rate/[conc] is the rate constant but it's also the normalized rate i.e. per unit protein or per mrna", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
