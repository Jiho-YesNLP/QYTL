Note that, no, you can't just put double-quotes (which I only used to make the above line clear) in the user field to get around this as it works by telling the database that the thing to match against for \"user = ?\" is literally \"what's in this buffer\", no quote-delimiting going on.", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_GzE99AmAQU", "cid": "UgwX2vYf00iEUWhFrvR4AaABAg", "comment": "Why am I watching this, I already passed my intro to cyber security class?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_GzE99AmAQU", "cid": "UgwMwEBOTQcgaRx1Cbh4AaABAg", "comment": "This is really helpful for me, was about to make user login that is vulnerable to code injection \ud83d\ude02", "votes": "4", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_GzE99AmAQU", "cid": "Ugxc5G77MXuMGV80UXx4AaABAg.8YyR0RK2EcG8Yyo3UWydz7", "comment": "Tinfoil hat indeed.
