So I watched the video for the second time. Now I have a better understanding of how finite difference works with 2d scenario. This is a very important section. To summarize, how to obtain the K2D matrix is essential. Then note that GE is not totally free. With a sparse matrix, it is important to first move along with your nonzero entries before applying GE. Also using eigenpairs (if they can be easily found) to solve linear equations is another clever way.
