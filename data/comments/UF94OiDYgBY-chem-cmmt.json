But the passion involved in this guy when teaching, is something viral, and i want to appoint that, my passion in chemistry has revived.

I hope this finds you Jeffrey Grossman. I have spent the the Covid lockdown on the internet.    Early on it was social media but soon moved to YouTube and quit by accident MIT.   And one of the best lecture series I have watched I'd yours. You challange your students to pursue a life of learning.     I'm 72 and I think thermodynamics or biological chemistry are my next two  opportunities to keep it going.... and of course it will be MIT. Since I do not need to apply what I've learned I can take an accelerated approach.    I have been known to watch a lecture a day and sometimes two every morning.
