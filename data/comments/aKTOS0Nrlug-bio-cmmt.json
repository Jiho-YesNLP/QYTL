The tongue and the nose bouth analyze taste. As far as I know at least, I am not an expert in the field. But they have different activation thresholds. So, if let's say I taste a very small amount of a substance, let's say a lemon, it is possible for one to get activated and the other not to get activated. If this happens, the brain recieves two different responses for the same stimulus. And in my personal experience, this acts like a drug. The brain gets confused and I get dizzy, cheerful, it depend on the substances. But all the substances I am talking about are food, not drugs. For example I squeez maybe 0.1 grams of lemon in a lidzen tea and when I drink it I feel like I am drunk. Something like that. In order to prepare the drink, I simply add very little lemon to the tea and smell it. I feel some sort of a sting in my nose and I imediatly start feeling the effects. I don't really know how this works exactly from a neuroligical perspective. I think of it like I said, two different inputs for the same stimuls and the brain gets in overdrive. I am curious if anyone tried experimenting with something like this.
