Please continue the good work.   Is it possible to have capacity miss in direct mapping? Is it possible to have conflict miss in fully associative mapping? Lastly, is it possible to have conflict miss in set associative mapping? My understanding(based on earlier explanation), there will be only conflict miss in direct mapping, similarly, there will be only conflict miss in k- map set associative mapping? On other topic, are you planning to cover coherency misses in later videos?  @14.00 In case of write miss with NO-write allocate, when will block cached?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1tvW8kzOpSA", "cid": "Ugy2SNdE0L7p8Dmg_l14AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1tvW8kzOpSA", "cid": "UgyLcMNPmM8rOYifZJx4AaABAg", "comment": "This is great.
