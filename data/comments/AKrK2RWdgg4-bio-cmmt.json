Your presentation is well organized and very easy to follow.  Particularly the DNA molecules in your presentation were well explained structurally and functionally. In addition, the Avery experiment is very compelling. I agree that Avery should have been recognized and won the Nobel Price for his discovery.  I have not read the grand details of Avery's experiment yet. Correct me if I am wrong. Based on what the diagram shown in your presentation, it appears that the isolated DNA from dead virulent S-strain incorporating with the avirulent R-strain to lead to the change of gene expression of avirulent R-strain which is transformed to a virulent strain. Is it a reasonable hypothesis?  I also wonder if there were enzymes like reverse transcriptase and integrase as cofactors to reverse transcribe the virulent DNA into the DNA of R strain?

Griffith proved that \u201csomething\u201d could transmit information - and therefore traits - between cells but there was already some empirical evidence of that being possible and a shift occurring in biology that inheritance was somehow chemical. It was Avery and his group that confirmed Griffith\u2019s work and took it to the next necessary level to prove that DNA was the information storing (and heritable) material of life. So, while I agree that not mentioning Griffith was an omission (to save time and simplicity), I still contend that if not for Avery, I wouldn\u2019t have a job \ud83d\ude09 Thanks got an excellent contribution to the conversation and for your interest in my videos!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AKrK2RWdgg4", "cid": "UgxFUDQ4ahNorFTTD4F4AaABAg.9cAQVVBCf-E9cIupasuho8", "comment": "For this course in cell and molecular biology, I use Alberts\u2019 Essential Cell Biology", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "AKrK2RWdgg4", "cid": "UgxFUDQ4ahNorFTTD4F4AaABAg.9cAQVVBCf-E9hSTeNQ0paT", "comment": "\u00a0@thomasmennella5501\u00a0 what edition ?
