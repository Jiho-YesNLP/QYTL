If you measure this giant pizza's total crust length, you will get 6 feet 3.4 inches, which is 6.28 feet.  This is 2*pi*radius.  When the radius is 1, arc length around the circle is the angle in radians.  Don't let it deceive you that a pizza is sometimes called a pie or that pie sounds similar to the name of the letter pi.  It is just a coincidence, and is an artifact of the English language's evolution that this happens.   In the original Greek, the letter pi sounds like the English word \"pea\".
