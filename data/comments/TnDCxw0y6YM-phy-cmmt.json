Short Answer:  If \u0394U = Q + W, \u0394U (a state function) can be related to Q\u2013W by the relation Q\u2013W = (Q + W)\u20132W = \u0394U\u20132W. Although \u0394U is a state function W is not. W is a path-dependent quantity in that, the amount of work done ON a system going from state A to state B depends on the path taken. Whereas the sum (or product) of two state functions is also a state function (\u0394G = \u0394H\u2013T\u0394S), the sum of a state function and a path-dependent quantity is not. Thus, the sum of these two terms cannot be a state function.  Long Answer:  Consider two arbitrary processes that take a system from the same initial state (state A) to the same final state (state B). The change in internal energy for process 1 can be written as \u0394U1 = Q1 + W1. The change in internal energy for process 2 can be written as \u0394U2 = Q2 + W2. We can also write expressions for Q\u2013W for each process using the relation Q\u2013W = \u0394U\u20132W. For process 1, Q1\u2013W1 = \u0394U1\u20132W1. For process 2, Q2\u2013W2 = \u0394U\u20132W2.  In order for a quantity for be considered a state function, it must be path-independent. This means that for any two arbitrary processes that take the system from the same initial state to the same final state, the change in that quantity must be the same.  Suppose Q\u2013W is a state function. Then, it must be the same for our two processes. In other words, Q1\u2013W1 = Q2\u2013W2. This can also be written as \u0394U1\u20132W1 = \u0394U2\u20132W2. Because the processes take the system from the same initial and final states and because \u0394U is a state function, \u0394U1 = \u0394U2. Thus, we can cancel out \u0394U1 and \u0394U2 from their respective sides. We're left with \u20132W1 = \u20132W2. But in general, W1 and W2 will not be the same because as I mentioned before, work is a path-dependent quantity. Therefore, Q\u2013W is not a state function despite the fact that Q + W is.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "Ugzr_r9NJ-nKHNZzRMF4AaABAg.9EBFTXmeLcp9JNNtrjpDL5", "comment": "i dunno man that kinda sounds like assault", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "Ugzr_r9NJ-nKHNZzRMF4AaABAg.9EBFTXmeLcp9K0MuQ9gevv", "comment": "\u00a0@monthertheokguy7311\u00a0 true", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "UgxrO_HysdAZoMnqGM94AaABAg", "comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj9YJLVTu8A&t=16s", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "UgyeEtiIyCtg3tZML9p4AaABAg", "comment": "Ive been using your videos through college and you have helped me get through everything. thank you", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "UgwEIvtKI-htLAvlO7t4AaABAg", "comment": "You make it fun to learn.

On the surface, it's very interesting, but when it gets to the numbers, you're nearly guaranteed to find at least 50%+ of it a pain in the arse.   Most engineers end up in a very specific section of their industry, and universities can't just show you that very specific part you may end up doing. So instead you'll of course cover a wide array of topics and you'll find a good amount of it a ballache.   You'll be tired, a lot. There'll be weekends where you don't get to rest because of 3 assignments, maybe week after week. Because of the tiredness, you'll probably also fall behind on lectures by a week or two sometimes. And because of that, you won't be living some ideal student life you may have been told is possible.   BUT, it remains Aerospace. At the end of the day, I am studying in detail some of the coolest shit on the planet. And for the 50% boring shit you'll end up doing, there'll be a good 50% where you think, damn, this is actually kinda cool. And after it's all said and done, once your get your degree, you'll end up reaping the profits of your hard work and sacrificed social life.  Could I have picked something easier? Without a doubt. It would've been a hell of a lot less stress (a HELL of a lot less).

Landauer's hypothesis, that the Demon must erase its memory and incur a thermodynamic cost, has become the standard response to Maxwell's dilemma, and its implications for the thermodynamics of computation reach into many areas of quantum and classical computing. Landauer\u2019s hypothesis was introduced to get around the problem of Maxwell\u2019s Demon: a diabolic entity who could apparently violate the second law of thermodynamics within a closed system.  The second law of thermodynamics, in one of its formulations, states that within a closed system the quantity entropy is non-decreasing over time. Some processes are only allowed to operate in one temporal direction. This appears to conflict with underlying reversible microdynamics, either quantum or classical Newtonian. Since the formulation of thermodynamics, toy model thermodynamic systems have been used in debates around these foundational issues. The simplest example is a single particle in a box, in contact with a heat bath. The thermodynamic variables can be easily specified, while at the same time the microdynamics for the single particle are easily comprehensible. While there are important issues around whether this system can actually be said to have a thermodynamics (usually considered a theory of large numbers of particles), it is a useful tool and the form of system that has been considered by a large number of authors from Szilard. By formalising this system, we also give a starting-point for a similar semantics of many-particle thermodynamic systems. The fundamental system under consideration is a single particle gas in a box, connected to an external heat bath. The heat bath keeps the entire system at a specific temperature T; this is a constant and not a variable. The thermodynamic variables for the system are: pressure of the gas (i.e. the force exerted on the walls of the box by the continuous motion of the single particle) p, volume occupied by the gasV, and entropy of the system H. There is a removable partition in the middle of the box, and two pistons (left and right) which can either compress the gas and input work \u2212W into the system (isothermal compression) or expand under pressure of the gas thereby extracting work W from the box (isothermal expansion). There are two fundamental equations of state for the system: pV/ T =const Hout \u2212Hin =kln Vout /Vin  where again k is the Bolzmann constant, and where \u2018out\u2019 and \u2018in\u2019 refer respectively to output and input values of parameters for a given transition. The first means that pressure and volume are not independent at a fixed temperature; only one variable need be specifed. The second equation means that a decrease in system volume of a half decreases the entropy of the system by kln2. A doubling of the system volume increases the entropy by the same amount. In isothermal expansion from volumeV \u2192 2V, the amount of work done by the gas on the piston isW =kT ln2. In isothermal compression 2V \u2192V, the same amount of work is input to the gas by the piston.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "UgxMEWKrsrvGOuHgb_d4AaABAg", "comment": "HAS represent", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "UgzP1hQTxfNPFCyNXz94AaABAg", "comment": "Hmmm no word can explain my degree of understanding thanks fam am not the same student as i used to", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "Ugxl_vdzWAwCy6rWJcZ4AaABAg", "comment": "I watched the complete video.hurray , AIIMS delhi i am coming", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "TnDCxw0y6YM", "cid": "UgzhXQz2J3Mt8laqMDd4AaABAg", "comment": "U r my savior !
