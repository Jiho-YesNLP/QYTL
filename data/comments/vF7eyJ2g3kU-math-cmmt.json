If it operates on a vector in the first quadrant, it guarantees that the output vector is also in the first quadrant. This is almost like a closure property under the transformation of a matrix. I need to examine the case when the x vector in Ax is not in the first quadrant. The entire underlying theme is creating something that is very close to an Eigen matrix with more weight around the diagonal. The important of Eigen matrices is well known in applications where the power matrix has the same effect of a power scalar function. With big matrices, there is nothing more valuable than decomposing a matrix in terms of simpler matrices among which the Eigen matrix is one of those decompositions. Diagonalizing a matrix and SVD is very related to this theme.

If this were not the case, there would be a direction next to the point in question where the function decreases - the direction opposite to the gradient - and this would contradict the fact that it is a minimum.  If one takes an arbitrary function and carries out a Taylor expansion around the minimum, all terms of order higher than two can be neglected if we are close enough to the minimum (and we just need to know the function values right next to the minimum point to know that it is a minimum). Since the gradient is zero, all first-order derivatives are zero at the minimum point, and then we just have the constant term - the function value at the minimum - and the second order derivatives. The Taylor approximation around the minimum can thus be written as f(x_0 + x) \u2248\u00a0f(x_0) + 1/2 (x^T A x), where A is the matrix of second derivatives (the Hessian) and x_0 is the minimum.  Thus, if x^T A x > 0 for all x - i.e., the matrix A is positive definite - this is in particular valid for small x-values (such that x_0 + x is close to x_0), where the Taylor approximation is a good approximation of f(x_0 + x). Thus, we can conclude that in a neighbourhood of the point x_0 (i.e. if we are close enough so that the Taylor approximation is good), all other points give function values such that f(x_0 + x) > f(x_0), and thus x_0 is a local minimum, since the function has higher values for all points in a neighbourhood around this point.", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "vF7eyJ2g3kU", "cid": "UgiMbGL8I6QHN3gCoAEC.8D2FnVhtnxn8EsJQBtKrTM", "comment": "Lets see! gonna do it!
