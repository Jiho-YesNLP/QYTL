Instead, an object can be considered real if it influences the physical world in a tangible fashion, which Mathematics certainly does. Additionally, as to the proposed physical nonexistence of mathematical constructs, it is not a clear cut either; for example, the notion of number -- and thus, the study of it -- emerges very intrinsically the physical world as the natural quantifier, independent of human practices. Another relevant instance in relation to this is how there exist many physical objects which document mathematics, are enabled by it, or both. Furthermore, like physical phenomena, mathematical entities can also be consistently perceived, gauged, and actioned upon in a physical capacity. In fact, physical phenomena cannot be contemplated effectively in a practical manner without the consideration of mathematical quantities. Any discussion of physical phenomena devoid of actual, observed  quantities is often theoretical, abstract, and therefore, incorporeal, divorced from the physical space. In synopsis, my argument is that directly physical existence is merely a subcategory of reality, that an object should be considered real if it indirectly influences the physical world in a tangible, consequential, and indirectly physical manner, and that to an extent, mathematical constructs do manifest physically, albeit indirectly.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "o7UCBjGsRTE", "cid": "UgxNjNcQiJABiUQVE214AaABAg.8GcZFrCUfSZ8u26knKVkxC", "comment": "In most of the cases, these are what are driving actions behind the scene.
