I appreciate that he uses concrete examples and also makes it clear that these are models/abstractions. 2) fortunately I do have a strong enough mathematical background to follow, but I assume that most watchers won't. IMO it would be beneficial to note at the start of the video what \"prerequisites\" there are. I'm from a bio background and a lot of my peers would not remember enough calculus for this.

However, it will be very helpful if you are comfortable with the material in Introductory Biology 7.012, Differential Equations 18.03, and Probability 18.05. In addition, each weekly problem set will have a computational problem, so prior experience with a computational package such as MATLAB\u00ae, Mathematica\u00ae, or Python is expected.\" Best wishes on your studies!", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "lC3XSwQ62iw", "cid": "Ugy2gWWcMlj-pAh8JP54AaABAg.9dnikC_ZGzG9n3TsalVYOH", "comment": "I thought he was using linear algebra.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
