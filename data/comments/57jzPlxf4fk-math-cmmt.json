The moving point's position is expressed as a function of time, allowing the derivation of equations for any point on the line. 09:53 \ud83d\udcca The general form of parametric equations for lines is x(t) = constant + constant * t, y(t) = constant + constant * t, z(t) = constant + constant * t. The coefficients indicate the direction along the line, and the constants determine the position at t=0. 15:57 \ud83e\udded To determine if a line intersects a plane and where, plug the parametric equations of the line into the plane's equation. If the resulting equation has a solution, the line intersects the plane; otherwise, it is parallel or contained within the plane. 20:47 \ud83d\udccd If the line and plane intersect, finding the time (t) when the moving point hits the plane allows determining the intersection point. If t is a solution, the line and plane intersect at that point. 24:46 \ud83d\udd04 If the coefficient of t in the equation (resulting from intersecting the line and plane) is zero, the line is parallel to the plane. If the coefficient is nonzero, it indicates the line's perpendicularity or intersection with the plane. 25:13 \ud83d\udd04 Parametric equations are versatile, applicable not only to lines but also to any curve or trajectory traced by a moving point in space. 28:12 \ud83d\udd04 The cycloid, a curve traced by a point on a rolling wheel, is an example of using parametric equations to describe complex motions in space. 30:26 \ud83d\udd04 The cycloid trajectory involves the wheel rotating, creating arches as the red point moves up and down. 32:10 \ud83d\udd04 Instead of using time as a parameter, the angle (theta) of the wheel rotation is chosen to describe the position of point P. 35:27 \ud83d\udd04 Vector analysis simplifies the problem by breaking it down into three vectors: OA, AB, and BP. 40:52 \ud83d\udd04 The position vector OP is the sum of OA, AB, and BP, resulting in x(theta) and y(theta) as functions of the angle theta. 43:23 \ud83d\udd04 Examining the simplified equations, when a=1, reveals x(theta) = theta - sin(theta) and y(theta) = 1 - cos(theta). 50:33 \ud83d\udd04 Near thebottom point, as theta approaches zero, the curve exhibits a vertical tangent, indicating a downward and upward motion with infinite slope at the origin.

Hence, every taylor approximation term containing even derivative of sine will be equal zero. Cosine is the similar, but with odd derivatives. Thats why linear approximation of sine x is x -> sin(x) ~ sin(0) + dsin(x)/dx * x = 0 + cos(0)*x = 0 + 1 * x = x . Next better approximation will be at Taylor n = 3 -> sin(x) = x - (x^3)/6 , since x + 0 (taylor with n = 2) doesn\u2019t give us any new information comparing to taylor n = 1", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
