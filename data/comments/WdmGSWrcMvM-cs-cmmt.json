In computer organizations, single bit errors are common, and Hamming code helps correct them. Parity bits are appended to the message for error correction. Two scenarios can occur: no corruption or one bit is corrupted. To handle errors, Hamming code requires 2^p patterns, where p is the number of parity bits, and 2^p >= p + M + 1, where M is the data size. Example: For 4 bits of data, 3 parity bits are needed. Parity bits are placed strategically to judge specific sets of data bits for errors. The receiver uses parity bits to determine which bit is corrupted and correct it. Hamming code allows for single bit error correction by pinpointing and correcting the erroneous bit.
