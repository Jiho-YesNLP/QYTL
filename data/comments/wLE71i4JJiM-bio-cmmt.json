I am ex military. Tanks do not go to the high ground to shoot things this is a death sentance for them being silhoetted against the sky. Tanks flow like water when they move taking as best they can the course wateer flows which means they are less of a target to the enemy. The Sherman tank was the main US Tank used through out WW2 that tank has been supersceded by 3 generations of Tanks to outr current design. Tanks don't bash down everything in sight this leads to unessecasry damage , betrays your position, and risks you breaking a track and getting caught in the rubble. Tanks don't fire missles, they have guns which fire shells two totally different forms of projectiles. Militaries do not fight like how u describe, They have organised Battle drills for every situation and they roll out like clockwork or a well organised sports team this is called Tactics. Modern Armies do not need to learn animal psychology on how to hunt etc We are the dominant species on this planet today not because we have sharp claws or are the biggest out there we dominate because of our ability to hunt in teams and work together to outsmart our prey. We are already this planets most advanced species in this respect and have been for a long time. We all have these qualities embedded deep down inside us and when placed in those situations they come out of us as instinct. along those levels there is nothing tactics wise we can learn from animals that we don't already know or have mastered long ago. We are human because of this. If the army wanted information like you said they wouldn't do it like you said they would be straight up and direct talk to your leading scientists on the subject and then follow your recomendations.

Create a Routine: Structured routines can help reduce the decision-making process and increase the likelihood of task initiation.  4. Exercise: Physical activity can help stimulate brain regions involved in attention and executive function, including the frontal cortex.  5. Mindfulness and Meditation: Practices that increase mindfulness can help improve focus and executive function.  6. Use of Visual Aids: Lists, planners, or digital reminders can help keep tasks visible and top-of-mind.  7. Environmental Modifications: Reducing distractions in the environment and having a dedicated workspace can help improve focus.  8. Behavioral Therapy: Techniques learned in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or through working with an ADHD coach can provide strategies for managing procrastination and increasing motivation.  9.

It covers so many points. Yet, I still feel that the title of \"Aggression II\", though quite serviceable, does not convey the full content of the lecture. Which is essentially about \"Connections and Interactions between the Amygdala, the Hippocampus, and the Frontal Cortex\", with the emphasis placed on the frontal cortex, since this is where the pondering and debating take place. Every time I watch this whole lecture on YouTube (which is often), I keep catching again little bits of information or quick comments that illuminate the complex functions of the brain, and the final importance of the frontal cortex.\u00a0 And every time, I lament and (loudly) rage at the inept cameraman who seems to have no concept what teaching is about and how it is done. He does not grasp the critical need of showing the full drawing on the right-side board, which forms, with the left-side sketch, the two poles of the lecture.  Prof. Sapolsky took the pain of preparing this right-board drawing in advance, and every time he steps from the left to come over to the right to point exactly where the inter-reactions happen on his sketch. And the camera refuses to follow his hand, never getting beyond the beard and the shoulder. Speaking of violation of professional purpose, this is a flagrant one. For there's no doubt that Prof. Sapolsky knows too well that we understand and remember far better the intricate connections of the brain centers when we see them on his careful drawings all connected and interacting with their various arrows. 3/4 of the lecture is on actions illustrated on the right-side board, and we, viewers miss praciically all Prof. Sapolsky's demonstrations.Nothing is more infuriating than this indifference from the camera.  It is A CRIME NOT TO SHOW THE FULL RIGHT-SIDE BOARD. This cameraman has done an unforgivable, utterly unprofessional disservice to the vast number of people on the planet who rely mostly on Prof. Sapolksy' videos for their education in the working of the brain. And this lecture No. 18 is no doubt on of the most important. How sad that this beautiful and rich lecture is marred by the sabotage of the camera. I cannot believe that Prof. Sapolsky gave the instruction that his beard should always remain at the center of the screen.\u00a0 There is, indeed, a theatrical aspect to Prof. Sapolsky's performance: in behavior, in his pacing, stopping, gesticulating with his arms, tilting and swinging his head to mimic the character in his description \u2014 and, of course, his exciting oral production. But the camera should remember that it is dealing with first and foremost a teacher.

The higher the exogenous testosterone, the more aggressive one gets (and the more impulsive). It is not only the aggression raising the testosterone in my case (and others I know). As Prof. Sapolsky said earlier in the video, the frontal cortex interacts with the amygdala to suppress impulsive animal-like behavior. Testosterone inhibits that control, and myself and others on testosterone replacement therapy find that to be true. When my testosterone level went to supraphysiological range (1800+ due to accidental overdose), I became many times more aggressive than I had ever been in my life (roid rage). The supraphysiological dose did not merely return me to previous aggressive levels. \"Effects of exogenous testosterone application on network connectivity within emotion regulation systems: Exogenous application of testosterone modifies resting-state connectivity within neural systems related to emotion regulation. Specifically, connectivity signals between the DLPCF and the amygdala as well as between the VMPFC and IPL are hampered by testosterone. These findings provide new insights into the role of testosterone in reducing fronto-subcortical and fronto-parietal connectivity potentially contributing to impaired emotion processing and regulation.\"", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "wLE71i4JJiM", "cid": "UgxP7AvV5aUD8z8X2ap4AaABAg", "comment": "Where is the rest of the lecture?!

Here, we can see our Incredibly Learned Professor delighting in the bizarreries of past human judgment \u2014 revealed by cool and rational research as conducted by his frontal cortex. But this does not preclude his own emotional reactions to the data, thus giving a play to his own limbic system, as often expressed in his little personal remarks of joy or disgust,  \"interesting\", \"exciting\", or\"whoa!\", \"depressing\", even \"absurd\", or \"insane\".  When he so delights in highlighing the ridiculously fanciful intuitions of the past, they are immediately exposed as the product of \"insane\"and tremendously ignorant moral/social considerations. While, by contrast,  he extols the illuminations from advancing scientific brain and behavior research in radically transforming our worldview. The implied suggestion is that many of our current beliefs about human nature and behavior may in the same manner suddenly or gradually change in the near future as an effect of new research data. If we read Professor  Sapolsky\u2019s six previous books, all the way to his recent magnum opus BEHAVE (2017), we cannot fail to be struck by his passionate interest in the repercussions of progressing neuroscience in undermining the  fallacies now accepted as given dogma in many of our current social practices and moral beliefs \u2014 and especially the failings of the legal system to update some of its backward rules.  In this critical manner, he joins the wave of scientific criticisms animating many scientists in brain research, such as, for instance, the empirical psychologist Daniel Kahneman.

It remains out of the camera angle for nearly all the 1h 45' of the lecture. Finally, the camera operator deigns to take in the full diagram at 53:12. This is the key illustration of the critical connections at work between the limbic system and the frontal cortex, with activation of various dopamine pathways. This cameraman consents to let the diagram shine in its full glory for 2 seconds from 53:15 to 53:17, to abandon it entirely at 53:20, never to be  seen again. Nothing more frustrating for a dedicated student of this whole course on Behavioral Neurobiology, offered on YouTube by Stanford Un., who is following the series of the  25 (or 27) lectures. Viewing that diagram early on, as soon as it becomes the center of the discussion, would have been essential to any viewer. After all, our Incredibly Learned Professor has lavished all his attention on his self-made sketch to make it nearly self-explanatory. Whatever drawings are on the boards are so critical for viewers who are not in the classroom to allow them to fully follow Prof. Sapolsky's rapid-fire presentations.\u00a0 Note that this neglect persists throughout the whole series of the lectures. This is the irritating weakness of all those videos. If the explanation is correct that this operator is a film student at the university who's given a chance for developing camera skills, it is tempting to believe that this student is under 25, with a frontal cortex not yet fully mature, and has not yet completely understood the dynamics of teaching and those of viewing  videos of those lectures. For this operator, the interest is not in the intellectual teaching process of our Incredibly Learned Professor,  but in following his photogenic personality at the center, finding satisfaction only in focusing on his beard, pony tail, and moving arms.\u00a0 Even when our Incredibly Learned Professor, in his Aristotelian ambulatory style, rushes from the left towards the right to point with his left arm to the famous diagram, the camera, obstinately stays focused on Prof. Sapolsky's fascinating figure, barely condescending to include some portion of the arm pointing towards the diagram, but never switching to a full take of the sketch, that we got only for a few fleeting seconds, way towards the end.

I've gotten used to thinking (having studied military history and science) that if an infantryman in WWI shoots another at range, there is barely aggression per ce involved; bayonet one from the front, and there's a great deal of it. Meaning, it is not the brutality of the act, but the 'natural' resistance of the soldier - or person in general - as well as the distance, moral and physical, which are factors here. Things get really complicated when one considers the way modern, post-Vietnam, training in the West prepares service personnel to fire at their targets, virtually bypassing all other brain functions but the motor ones.   Point being, aggression is far more complex than having someone in the ropes and scared and striking them all the same; anyone can bludgeon another into virtually accidental death with a rifle butt. However, taking the rifle and the bayonet, staring somebody in the eye, and driving the bayonet into their body with the explicit intent to kill them is very different. Takes training, or a very specific type of person who does not, per ce, enjoy it, but gets addicted to battle and the adrenaline fix. Or, just a psychopath. But soldiers can be 'trained' into psychopaths, meaning emotion is cut out as a middle man, and everything is training and motor reflexes reinforced by conditioning and reward.   This is my pet peeve with virtually all lectures on evil and aggression (non-scientific terms, I'd add) and not only this one.

I would be interested in hearing if any of you have any thoughts on which choice is right and why. To be clear, the next 3 paragraphs are all part of the question.  \u201cA brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley, approaching a fork in the track. The brain is hooked up to the trolley in such a way that the brain can determine which course the trolley will take. There are only two options: the right side of the fork, or the left side. There is no way to derail or stop the trolley, and the brain is aware of this. On the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Jones, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right. If Jones lives he will go on to kill five men for the sake of thirty orphans (one of the five men he will kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans\u2019 bus will be crossing later that night). One of the orphans who will be killed would have grown up to become a tyrant who made good, utilitarian men do bad things, another would have become John Sununu, a third would have invented the pop-top can.  If the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track, the trolley will definitely hit and kill another railman, Leftie, and will hit and destroy ten beating hearts on the track that would have been transplanted into ten patients at the local hospital who will die without donor hearts. These are the only hearts available, and the brain is aware of this. If the railman on the left side of the track lives, he, too, will kill five men \u2013 in fact, the same five that the railman on the right would kill. However, Leftie will kill the five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men: he will inadvertently kill the five men as he rushes the ten hearts to the local hospital for transplantation. A further result of Leftie\u2019s act is that the busload of orphans will be spared. Among the five men killed by Leftie is the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley. If the ten hearts and Leftie are killed by the trolley, the ten prospective heart-transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives of twenty kidney transplant patients, one of whom will grow up to cure cancer and one of whom will grow up to be Hitler. There are other kidneys and dialysis machines available, but the brain does not know this.  Assume that the brain\u2019s choice, whatever it turns out to be, will serve as an example to other brains in vats, and thus the effects of its decision will be amplified. Also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the fork, an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue, whereas if the brain chooses the left fork, a just war fraught with war crimes will result. Furthermore, there is an intermittently active Cartesian demon deceiving the brain in such a way that the brain is never sure that it is being deceived.

The world is chaotic (both in a general sense and in the more specific sense indicative of chaos theory - the effects that follow from effects where small differences now lead to big differences later) and most of what happens is because of luck - you cannot know the results of your decisions even to the extent that decisions matter. Also your own situation is inextricably subjective and you should not ever attempt to convince yourself of your own objectivity or demand objectivity from others. Fairness, sure but not objectivity.  As uncomfortable as this is to rationalists and consequentialist, it ethically matters which choice the trolley makes if you do nothing, and which you have to throw the switch to make happen. Because your intent matters, and what you would seek to do even if it has no effect matters (in cases like what you\u2019re describing, the consequences of what you do hardly matter at all).   You can explain this biologically by thinking about the frontal cortex and the difference between habituated behavior and conscious decisionmaking. In the absence of a clear understanding of the effects of your actions, or even in its presence, you should strive to make decisions that make you into the kind of person you think you ought to be - or, alternatively, that demonstrate and reinforce the intent, culture and mode of decisionmaking you would like to see in others.  So in this case you should try to stop the train or yell at people in whatever way you can to get off the tracks. Even if it does not work, and even if you know it does not work, you should still do it, because you are demonstrating to others that this is what they should do in the situation.  If you are pressed to throw the switch, you have two options - leave it where it\u2019s going and don\u2019t touch it, with the idea that you didn\u2019t cause the switch you be put in the direction it is currently in, and you don\u2019t want anything to do with it and regardless of the rationalists who will complain at you that is still your own subjective choice to make - they don\u2019t get to dictate the parameters of your mind - or flip a coin, with the idea that both men have an equal negative right to not be killed because we care more about people being people than we do about long-term chaotic, unknowable or unweighable consequences.  It should be reassuring to you that this specific situation is rare and you are demonstrating the correct way to handle the more common variation on this situation. If the situation is not rare you should not just accept the framing of the question and should instead strive to call into question why the trolley has no other safety measures.  This sounds like a cop out but it\u2019s not - another reason that the intuitive answer - to do nothing - might be correct - is that the likelihood that your information about the situation is incorrect is probably comparable to the rarity of the situation. Let\u2019s say that 99.99% of the time when you approach a trolley intersection this doesn\u2019t happen, and you get a false positive about this happening .01% of the time, then the chance that what is happening is what you think is happening is only 50/50 and you don\u2019t have any information at all.  This is a problem in medical testing that is more common than it looks. When something is rare in a population, the likelihood of a false positive can make an individual test meaningless - you always have to test with the prevalence of the thing you are looking for in mind.  Here\u2019s another hypothetical example - you are a social worker in child protective services, and you get a message that a certain child on the edge of town is in the hands of space aliens in disguise and you have to go take it away from its \u201clegal parents\u201d and put it into foster care now, with none of the usual procedure or controls because the aliens are going to use its DNA to build a supervirus and kill the human race.  Do you go put hands on this child? No, you immediately assume the message is insane or a joke or something else is going on and follow up on the message. It is okay that the ethics of your profession are not constructed to handle this kind of situation - your reality is inextricably subjective after all, there are no \u201cobjective space aliens\u201d - and we can be pretty confident there is no alien supervirus.   Since almost all the time you can stop the train and doing anything else barely matters you should take the chance your eyes are wrong, ignore the details you know, and just stop the train.  This is also what I think self-driving cars should do rather than make calculations about who or what to hit. Your sensors might be wrong, just try to stop safely. It is also good for you to behave predictably rather than to overcomplicate things - another problem with questions like this is the narcissistic assumption that you are the only person making a decision in the situation. This is rarely the case in real life - other people you are not aware of are constantly making decisions that affect the consequences of your own decisions. As a trolley driver, unless there is a super meaningful reason not to, you should not affirmatively decide to swerve for no apparent reason, so that if somebody else is, say, trying to push these guys off the track they can guess what you are going to do and aren\u2019t blindsided by it. If you don\u2019t understand a situation or aren\u2019t in control of it and only have bad decisions to make maybe you should do your job and let other people do theirs.  To further call the question into question - of what you decide serves as an example to other brains, and if the main thing you are worried about is war, then trying to stop the seemingly impossible to stop train is a good example to set that very well might have positive consequences in either eventuality.  The Cartesian demon is not a concern. Behave justly. If the Cartesian demon is just, your choices will be rewarded. If the demon is unjust, then you don\u2019t want to allow it to dictate your decisions anyway.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "wLE71i4JJiM", "cid": "UgxAY17IBCtR3wx8K5p4AaABAg.8llASqHeC3e8pcOoukbGNG", "comment": "2019 we still out here.", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "wLE71i4JJiM", "cid": "UgxAY17IBCtR3wx8K5p4AaABAg.8llASqHeC3e8wt8AZYllyl", "comment": "This is like a time machine.

Coursing predators , whether alone or in groups, are most prominently dependent on their attentional skills. Playing/fighting skills also (social playing/fighting) depend upon developed AND innate reflex arcs. So, social and environmental learning adds to  - practice improves some -  reflex arc development. Working and playing with wolf, I saw distinct learned cognition of whether an object was animate vs objects that were predictable (and thus not composed of edible parts). Adult wolves are bored by preditable inanimate movement, although always attentive to new stimuli.   There is another attentional difference between wolves and neotenous domesticated dogs. Wolves appear to have far faster reflexes under cognitive control, as their bite strength varies superbly in situations of blinding speed equivalent to serious lethal encounters. Dogs aggressively engaging a wolf will find themselves bearing serious wounds so quickly that most humans do not even see the strike. Yet most wolf social fighting is air bites, hip and shoulder checking. Firing a tennis ball at a wolf, the faster one throws it, the more accurate the midair catch, while a dog is better at gauging gravitational arcs, far poorer at pure speed accuracy. But, back to strategy. Strategy of lion prides, wolf packs, and coyotes have all been attributed to both individual responsiveness (attention) and in some cases, clear dispersal to strategic points and tactical drive or deception of prey. Corner-cutting is attentional, reflexive/cognitive, agile.  Hyenas, by the way, can kill female lions when a group of hyenas encounters a lioness. However, EVERY time a big male lion encounters any amount of hyenas, at least one hyena will be dead, the male lion uninjured. Thus you have evolutionary support for males' roless in lion prides, especially when you include the continuing protection of present cubs. Successful lion prides mostly have two males, one of which is reproductive, and the other usually a sibling of his. An adult male reproducer is in severe trouble if he is solo male in a pride.  Wolves, although males are 20% to near 50% larger, also retain a cubs-first eating pattern, enforced most often by the reproductive female. Painted  dogs are the most social predator, with many interesting and to us, often admirable, social traits. They are critically endangered due to heavy human fragmentation of habitat.They do the most alloparenting of any complete (both sexes. Gender is a word meaning the ending of words in romance and germanic languages, and is not properly applied to actual males, females, or intersex individuals) social animal. Wolves are also highly altruistic, with strong alloparenting, although this has been attributed to the closer relatinoship in the smaller wolf packs.  Interestingly hyenas (spotted are the largest of four species) are closer to the Felidae than to Canidae, just as the highly social likon is a felid. They both hunt in canid-like ways, although lions really retain the ambush characteristics of felids. Once, before the dispersal of Canidae, ancient hyena species numbered over 30 species. It seems that canids entering the scene outcompeted the more doglike hyena species, leaving only the four. Unlike wolves, the two larger hyenas are known to eat humans when opportune. They are as mythologized in Africa in the same vilifying way as wolves and coyotes are by Europeans and Euroamericans, another case of the misattribution of fiction as fact  mentioned by Sapolsky in the limbic/FC-ACC discussion.  Just today a pair of wolf biologists published a letter calling for neurological/evolutionary study of the hypothesis that some , but not all, humans hereditarily have antiwolf responses (I am inclined to bet that epigenetic and cultural misattribution of amygdala-mediated predator fear is in the mix. Maasai and more ancient Mediterranean boys and heroes equated overcoming of lions with manhood test, and Inuit/Inupiat, spearing a polar bear, are analogous traditions. The Euro- gun hunting arising in the 1800s is a safe aberration of something having to do with predators and social protection)", "votes": "20", "replies": "3", "reply": false}, {"vid": "wLE71i4JJiM", "cid": "Ugilpng-sp1RI3gCoAEC", "comment": "I remembered Phineas as getting the bar through under the zygomatic arch and out the fore crown, which cleaned his frontal clock - forehead would have missed the orbitofrontal cortex.

They wanted to kill her because they knew she would tell the world that Middle East refuses to purchase Antipsychotic medications (the only treatments which work for the mentally ill and psychotic/manic) because the Middle East leaders don't want the Phamaceudical companies whom are owned by the USA to profit from this. So instead they allow their mentally ill to suffer inside their illnesses or ship them all to the USA and Canada for treatments.  One injection of Antipsychotic medication for ONE person is $3000 a month.  Now add this up for the entire world.....USA cannot pay for the whole world to get mental health treatments.
