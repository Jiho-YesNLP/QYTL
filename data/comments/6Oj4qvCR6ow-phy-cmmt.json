First one has to talk about the direction of the magnetic field only. If the north side is facing upward, towards postive Y, it means that the current is antiparallel to that coming down on the right hand side from the positive of the battery. If you consider the magnetic field of the magnet towards the positive X direction, that is another thing. Then there is magnetic field of the wire itself., that being circular is a whole another subject. So I am not sure what field you are speaking off, the magnet or the wire? Both field interact to give sum vector for the force acting on the magnet and the wire... Furthermore, you mention that the current goes in through the magnet itself and then to the negative of the battery,  This implies that the wire must be bare and touching the magnets, unless that is not what you mean. And more: If you claim that the force acts on the conductor at point A only, this means that the wire going around the magnet in horizontal loop or otherwise does not add anything to the spin of the conductor. If that is the case then why not let the wire just hang down?", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "6Oj4qvCR6ow", "cid": "Ugy22Mq5sTbDByHfXC54AaABAg", "comment": "Didn't explain one f*cking thing about the Monopolar motor.", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "6Oj4qvCR6ow", "cid": "UgxB1mz-IypPkZbgF5t4AaABAg", "comment": "I disagree with your claim that inertia explains the difference in angular speed.   When the wire is further away, the force is less, so the speed at which the torque matches friction is lower.  It's friction that determines the final speed.

But, The coil size and distance you specify at the 12:00 minutes, kind of wrong. closer to the magnet will only give low inertia to spin faster, and a shorter length of the wire the lower resistance that will cause higher power gain and output. Therefore it is nothing to the with the current Lenz effect and other laws.
