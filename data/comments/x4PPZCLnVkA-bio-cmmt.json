There's a fast process and a slow process, and the more myelin there is, the less nodes are uncovered, and the FASTER the process is. The nodes are the slow process, and as the charge travels from the cell body to the terminal buttons the charge looses power. The nodes serve to recharge it, but it is a slower process. Smarter brains and neurons have more myelin covering more nodes, so that the times that the impulse is recharged is less but still enough to stay at the action potential. There is another Youtube video on myelin sheaths and saltatory conduction that gave me this information, and anyone wanting to know more about it should watch it.
