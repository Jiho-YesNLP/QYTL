Y-axis would become the X-axis, but in the opposite direction(meaning +y would be -x) and the X-axis would become the Y-axis. This way it is much easier.   That is basically what the method 2 does, but in a complicated manner. Idk, maybe solving the problem that way is useful, because switching the axes is not always possible. I am not sure, that is just the way I solved the problem.  One other important thing about this way is that you can easily see why it is \"right - left\", it is just because \"right\" becomes the upper(greater) part when you switch the axes.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_JXPe2J069c", "cid": "UgwsnfaYt3PxRJv8gKN4AaABAg", "comment": "It is wonderful that this professor can introduce the history in an inspiring way without disrupting the flow of the instruction.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_JXPe2J069c", "cid": "UgwyvwMV_kWv2Ci9oDl4AaABAg", "comment": "Erf \ud83d\ude02", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_JXPe2J069c", "cid": "UgzDl32DLfhIbjak-XN4AaABAg", "comment": "Props to Saurav Bastola, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7hkeE-LRyzietNCecWnHLg for the listed topics.
