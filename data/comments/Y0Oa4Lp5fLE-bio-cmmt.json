Here, the males must fight one another for reproductive access so the few strongest males have the most access to females . - sexual selection: species with bigger male-female size differences have females with a greater preference for larger male size. If your man will provide nothing but genes, get a man with good genes at least . - male parental behaviour: species with smaller male-female size differences have females who have a preference for males displaying paternal behaviour (competent males, not just big and aggressive males; hence some birds court by bringing females food to show capacity to provide.  . - life expectancy: species with larger male-female size differences have lower life spans for the males.  . - proclivity for twins (i.e. multiple offspring simultaneously). Smaller dimorphism = higher likelihood of twins as two parents put effort into raising the offspring.  . - child abandonment to pursue a higher ranking male: smaller dimorphism groups do this more often as the fathers would remain looking after the offspring    Tournament species (larger sexual dimorphism: males with big bright plumage e.g. peacock feathers, chicken pecking orders, baboons)  And  Pair-bonding, monogamous species (less sexual dimorphism, males and females difficult to distinguish by appearance)  Humans are somewhat in the middle", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "Ugxoy-DqS6NVJs_cK1p4AaABAg", "comment": "Ways to optimise the nunber of copies of yourbgenes in the enxt generations:  - individual selection  - inclusive fitness kin selection  - reciprocal altruism", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "UgxRU_dwDDmFpbzUAYx4AaABAg", "comment": "Martin George Garcia Edward Clark Jessica", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "Ugx3fDzx2GgVkYpH20h4AaABAg", "comment": "Smith Scott Harris Edward Clark Ronald", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "Ugw6PLDHx4-DNHjgbjF4AaABAg", "comment": "typedef struct Node {\r     char data;\r     struct Node* next;\r } Node;\r \r Node* create_node(char data) {\r     Node* new_node = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));\r     new_node->data = data;\r     new_node->next = NULL;\r     return new_node;\r }\r \r void insert_node(Node** head, char data) {\r     Node* new_node = create_node(data);\r     if (*head == NULL) {\r         *head = new_node;\r     } else {\r         Node* temp = *head;\r         while (temp->next != NULL) {\r             temp = temp->next;\r         }\r         temp->next = new_node;\r     }\r }\r \r char* linked_list_to_string(Node* head) {\r     int length = 0;\r     Node* temp = head;\r     while (temp != NULL) {\r         length++;\r         temp = temp->next;\r     }\r     \r     char* str = (char*)malloc((length + 1) * sizeof(char));\r     temp = head;\r     int i = 0;\r     while (temp != NULL) {\r         str[i++] = temp->data;\r         temp = temp->next;\r     }\r     str[i] = '\\0';\r     return str;\r }\r \r void free_list(Node* head) {\r     Node* temp;\r     while (head != NULL) {\r         temp = head;\r         head = head->next;\r         free(temp);\r     }\r }\r \r char* encrypt(const char* message, int key) {\r     int len = strlen(message);\r     char* encrypted = (char*)malloc((len + 1) * sizeof(char));\r     for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\r         if (message[i] >= 'A' && message[i] <= 'Z') {\r             encrypted[i] = ENCRYPT(message[i], key);\r         } else {\r             encrypted[i] = message[i];\r         }\r     }\r     encrypted[len] = '\\0';\r     return encrypted;\r }\r \r char* decrypt(const char* message, int key) {\r     int len = strlen(message);\r     char* decrypted = (char*)malloc((len + 1) * sizeof(char));\r     for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\r         if (message[i] >= 'A' && message[i] <= 'Z') {\r             decrypted[i] = DECRYPT(message[i], key);\r         } else {\r             decrypted[i] = message[i];\r         }\r     }\r     decrypted[len] = '\\0';\r     return decrypted;\r }", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "UgxxyFZjvcaZwyl5klJ4AaABAg", "comment": "Robinson Kevin Clark Ronald Thompson Brian", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "UgxsjRYFkzluTOrFUrV4AaABAg", "comment": "I hope no podcast guys see this.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "UgytDWBZQs26MF9c4HR4AaABAg", "comment": "Why on the 0:21 he's saying bio150, bio250, hum bio160 is the same thing?

In terms of value to the general population, if the gains and losses are a percentage of accumulated wealth from playing this game, then increased oscillations between cheating, getting cheated, both having the same response would cause a net negative effect on everyone forced to play the same tit for tat strategy; this is an application of the volatility drag.

Stanford professor Robert Sapolsky introduces the course and discusses student enrollment, motivations, and humorous responses from the questionnaire. 03:22 \ud83e\udde0 The Biology of Religiosity and Interests - Sapolsky talks about student interests and preferences, including the topic of the biology of religiosity. 04:18 \ud83e\uddec Applying Darwinian Principles - Sapolsky discusses applying Darwinian principles to understanding behavior and the concept of natural selection. 07:36 \ud83c\udf0d Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology - The emergence of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology as disciplines to understand behavior in the context of evolution. 12:50 \ud83e\udd81 Individual Selection - The concept of individual selection, where behavior aims to maximize the number of copies of an individual's genes in the next generation. 22:50 \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Understanding Behavioral Evolution - The lecture introduces the concept of behavioral evolution and natural selection. - Key ideas: individual selection, passing on genes, maximizing reproductive success. 26:05 \ud83e\uddec Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness - The section discusses kin selection and the role of relatedness in behavior. - Key points: kin selection, inclusive fitness, cooperation with relatives. 30:18 \ud83e\udd1d Reciprocal Altruism - The lecture delves into reciprocal altruism and cooperation among non-relatives. - Key ideas: reciprocal altruism, cooperation, vigilance against cheaters. 35:04 \ud83c\udfae Game Theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma - The section introduces game theory and the classic example of the Prisoner's Dilemma. - Key takeaways: optimal strategies, rationality, the role of pleasure in decision-making. 45:39 \ud83d\udcbb Robert Axelrod's Contribution - Discusses Robert Axelrod's pivotal role in the field of game theory through his tournament involving various strategies. - Key point: Axelrod's computerized tournament and its impact on the study of cooperation. 46:08 \ud83d\udc1f Reciprocal altruism in vampire bats and signal error - Vampire bats exhibit reciprocal altruism, cooperating to feed each other's babies. - Signal error can disrupt this cooperation, leading to tit-for-tat retaliation. 50:47 \ud83d\udc1f Forgiving tit for tat and transitioning to trust - Forgiving tit for tat strategy emerges to counter signal errors. - Transitioning to trusting others when no cheating occurs. 54:25 \ud83d\udc1f Exploiting forgiving tit for tat with Pavlov - The Pavlov strategy can exploit forgiving tit for tat. - The introduction of signal error impacts strategies. 01:02:29 \ud83d\udc1f Reciprocal altruism in vampire bats and signal error - Vampire bats exhibit reciprocal altruism, cooperating to feed each other's babies. - Signal error can disrupt this cooperation, leading to tit-for-tat retaliation. 01:06:21 \ud83d\udc1f Tit-for-tat in stickleback fish - Stickleback fish exhibit tit-for-tat behavior against their own reflection when they perceive cheating. - Exploring reciprocal strategies within a single fish. 01:08:13 \ud83e\udd81 Lions' Reciprocal Altruism - Craig Packer's research on lions in East Africa shows reciprocal altruism even among non-relatives. - Observations of a scaredy cat lion challenging the expected tit-for-tat behavior introduced a puzzle. - Real-world complexities such as individuals playing multiple games simultaneously and role diversification became evident. 01:12:02 \ud83d\udc00 Naked Mole Rats' Role Diversification - Naked mole rats live in cooperative colonies with non-relatives and display reciprocity. - Some individuals in these colonies don't participate in labor but play an essential role in defense. - Role diversification highlights the complexity of real-world social interactions. 01:14:25 \ud83d\udcbb James Holland's Mutation in Game Theory - James Holland introduced the idea of mutations in game theory, studying how they affect strategies and behaviors. - Mutations can lead to the evolution of different strategies, influencing behavior. - This concept demonstrates the realism of game theory in understanding behavior in various species. 01:19:16 \ud83d\udc6b Male-Female Body Size Differences - Species with significant sexual dimorphism in body size tend to have more male aggression. - High variability in male reproductive success is found in species with sexual dimorphism. - In species with low sexual dimorphism, females choose males who exhibit paternal behavior and competence. 01:25:57 \u231b\ufe0f Gender-Based Life Span Differences - Species with substantial sexual dimorphism in body size often show differences in life expectancy between genders. - Species with low sexual dimorphism have similar life spans for both males and females. - These differences arise from energy allocation, metabolism, and reproductive strategies. 01:26:53 \ud83d\udc76 Giving Birth to Twins in Primates - Primates with low sexual dimorphism typically give birth to twins, and both offspring tend to survive. - Species with high sexual dimorphism cannot support twin offspring due to limited resources. - The decision to abandon or care for offspring depends on the level of male parental investment. 01:27:48 \ud83d\udc6a Tournament vs. Pair Bonding Species - Tournament species display strong sexual dimorphism and competition for mates. - Pair bonding species have less sexual dimorphism, and males actively participate in parenting. - The differences in mating strategies and behaviors result from investment in reproduction. 01:30:12 \ud83e\udd8d Evolution of Primate Behavior - Explanation of sexual dimorphism in primates, such as baboons. - Tournament species with male-male aggression and large males. - Influence of energy allocation and parental behavior on reproduction. 01:31:09 \ud83d\udc12 Pair Bonding in South American Monkeys - Description of pair bonding species, exemplified by South American monkeys. - Lack of sexual dimorphism and differences in social behavior compared to tournament species. - High reproductive rates, shared parental care, and low aggression in pair bonding species. 01:32:37 \ud83e\udd89 Consistency Across Species - Discussion of consistent patterns between different species, including birds, fish, and primates. - The dichotomy between tournament species and pair bonding species. - Factors contributing to low variability in pair bonding species. 01:33:34 \ud83c\udf0d Where Do Humans Fit? -

Heritability and variability of traits in populations  The heritability and variability of traits in populations play a significant role in determining the success of species. Mutations introduce new traits, and adaptiveness helps ensure that more copies of genes pass on to the next generation. The genetic components in behaviors, including group selection, individual selection, and sexual selection, optimize gene reproduction and relatedness.  2. Kin selection and inclusive fitness in animal behavior  Animals like primates have the ability to track kinship and optimize behavior based on relatedness. Inclusive fitness and kin selection theories explain why organisms help relatives to increase reproductive success in order to maximize future success. A study with vervet monkeys in Tanzania showed evidence for inclusive fitness and kin selection through different vocalizations and responses to alarm calls.  3. Reciprocal altruism in animals and bacteria  Reciprocal altruism, a system of cooperation among non-relatives, exists in long-lived social vertebrates and bacteria/fungi. Social behavior entails reciprocal relationships, with detecting cheating being crucial. Animals exhibit true cooperation, unlike the mere truce in competition seen between bacteria and humans. Cooperative behavior, like cooperative hunting and food sharing, increases the likelihood of success and reciprocity.  4. Science of cooperation and cheating through game theory  Game theory explores the balance between cooperation and cheating in social species like humans and chimps. The Prisoner's Dilemma model is often used to study cooperation and defection in various situations. The most successful strategy for cooperation is tit for tat, which involves starting with cooperation and reciprocating the other person's behavior in subsequent rounds. However, forgiving tit for tat and other strategies can be effective in certain scenarios. Perceived madness in game theory can also lead to optimal benefits and cooperation.  5. Reciprocal strategies in animal societies  Animals in the wild exhibit reciprocal strategies like tit for tat, where cooperation is rewarded and cheating is punished. This behavior is observed in fish, bats, and naked mole rats. Some individuals in these societies do not contribute to work and are not punished but exhibit non-cooperative behavior. Vampire bats and stickleback fish use a tit for tat strategy to respond to signals and errors. Certain fish species, such as black hamlet fish, can strategically change gender.  6. Optimization and altruism in evolution  Game theory and optimization applications help understand behavior and design optimal strategies, including the evolution of optimal strategies, reciprocal altruism, cooperative hunting, and sexual selection in various species. The discussion also covers three ways to optimize gene copies in the next generation and how humans uniquely determine kinship, leading to reciprocal altruism and vigilance against cheating.  7. Mating and parental behavior in different species  Male aggression and reproductive success are influenced by female choice and differential access. Female mate choice aims to produce genetically well-endowed offspring. In some species, male parental behavior is crucial to offspring survival and is influenced by female choice for desirable traits. Sexual dimorphism and social structure vary among species, with humans falling between tournament and pair bonding species. Polygamy is present in many cultures, but most individuals are monogamous.

That is principles helps you to look in past and make conclusions.  Sociobiology to evolutionary psychology.

Logic of Darwinian evolution:  a) There are traits that are heritable. b) There is variatiability among traits. c) Some versions of those traits(ones favouring the circumstances/environment) are more adaptive than others.  Same logic with behaviour. Inheritable. Variations because of mutations. Some are more adaptive than behaviours.  Assumption: Certain behaviours have genetic components.  Unlearn the learned. Example: Animals behave for the good of species. Not survival of the fittest.   Building blocks for behaviour :   When actually, animals behave in order to maximize the number of copies of genes they can pass on to next generation. Sometimes, it may look as if it's for the good of species.  a) Individual selection (reproductive success of an individual. Passing of your own genes) and sexual selection (might not favour environment but some animals still preferring those traits). Usually contradicting each other.  b) Kin selection: Helping out relatives in terms of increasing their reproductive success. Animals cooperating with relatives but as a function of how closely related they are. Animals understand kinship. Evolution has endowned with ability to optimise behaviour along lines of relatedness. Lay down life for two siblings or eight cousins.  c) System of reciprocal altruism among non-relatives. Usually smart animals . Possibility of cheating. When is optimal to co-operate and when is optimal to cheat . Prisoner's Dilemma- Tit for tat( usually in an iterated game). The incentives matter a lot.

After all, the situation is the same, whether the male or the female leaves first, the other one is left with the children, possibly able to make them survive, and condemning them to death when leaving as well.   I'd have guessed it'd still be more common among males in those species, because the females have more to lose. If both parents abandon the children and they die, the male invested less (just sperm, compared to egg, pregnancy, possibly nurturing --- pregnancy alone seems like a huge cost). I could understand it being rare among both males and females in such species, but it specifically occurring among females baffles me.

[Orchestrated wars, evolution, history, news, cosmology, etc. are done to keep us in bondage.]  MODELS OF NATURE THAT DENY INTELLIGENT DESIGN, THE REASON THESE: [  --A people kept in fear are easily controlled!  If a person is convinced that there is no hope beyond the grave, that person will likely be unwilling to die for any cause, no matter what that cause may be.  When this attitude becomes prevalent in a society, slavery is at the door-step of that nation. This is the reason that Satan, through his children which have always been in the \"high-places\" of the world, brought in the falsehoods of \"evolution\" and a faked cosmology.  These are meant to keep people feeling small, powerless, and insignificant--running in fear of death.  ]       For several hundred years, you can trace thousands of ad-hoc fixes added onto failing models relating to the nature of our world, models that attempt to explain origins and cosmology on a purely naturalistic basis. They use wild imaginings which take the form of huge unsupported assumptions, anecdotal and unverified data, ad-hoc equations added onto legitimate physics equations, ignoring well established results obtained from experiments done in the past. This has led to the almost universal belief and widely promoted idea, that the new is better than the old. This has taken such a turn, that almost everything that was believed in the past, has been taunted as superstition, or that our ancestors did not have the intellect nor the means to do a proper job. This can't be any further from the truth, if anyone were to look into the matter, they would find that our predecessors had by far a clearer mind and intellect than most of us living today. Just pickup a second grade school book, on any subject, prior to 1920, and you'd be amazed at the high level of learning the average schooled child was capable of function at; it would place almost everyone of today's school children in a special needs classroom.  The reluctance of scientists to go out in the field, to do real work, has led to numerous false formulations being added onto former models that were also based upon previous falsehoods, thus digging an ever increasing pit of deceptions. Similar to a shoe-clerk convincing a customer to buy a smaller sized shoe than that which fits, leading only to foot sores and bunions. At around the turn of the 19th century, scientists started leaving true natural exploration, in favor of remaining in the office and classroom, being content in adding to, or modifying the previous work of their colleagues. They no longer scrutinized established ideas, no longer using critical thinking ( i.e. garbage in garbage out ).  For the most part, none of these models have been used successfully in providing solutions for either, future outcomes (e.g. weather forecasting, forecasting planetary attributes, etc.), or to provide solutions for problems that had to many variables, or variables to hard to obtain --which is the legitimate purpose for a model.  By plugging values into a true-model's variables, you are able to obtain useful information, upon which decisions could be made. Most if not all of these ad-hoc atheistic-models, ironically seem to work in reverse; when used to predict a possible future outcome, they are found almost always to be in error. When these errors occur and it becomes evident to the interested public, a bunch of zealots will get together to obtain and then implement a quick fix. They will NEVER throw the model away, because it's the only-thing that supports their world view, and the most fundamental and incorrect assumption, that everything can be explained by purely naturalistic means (i.e. this is a religious world-view, base on blind faith). Once an ad-hoc fix is introduced to a falling model, another round of predictions are made, and in time, it too will produce an erroneous result, which again will be kept hidden until there is enough push-back from the interested public. And so it will go on indefinitely. The public at large will never know because they have been indoctrinated not to think nor ask any questions if indeed some do think. They will never throw-out the model because any true replacement model would demonstrate Intelligent design, which would become an assault on the very foundation of their desires, which is to eliminate God. This proves that the atheist is not seeking truth, but denying it, and that they are promoting a religious world view, and NOT TRUE science. We that are Christian admit that our views are of a \"religious\" nature( in reality we believe in a saving relationship, in which we come to \"know\" God ), and we do not pretend that we are giving you a purely scientific world view on things unseen. However, the true Christian scientist will provide honest results, and history has proven so. Furthermore, if you examine the Biblical claims, you will find that they mesh with natural realities much better than any ungodly secular view.

ON WHAT SOME CALL SCIENCE [ The holders of the secret kabbalah, and how they support the agenda of the elite ]      Science is never based on a consensus, it's based on observation and reproducible experimentation(usually conducted by a single person). Anytime the term \"scientific consensus\" is used, it is strictly political and religious. Notice the similarities between today's religion of \"Scientisim\" and the ancient \"Pagan Religions\", in ancient days the 'pagan priests' were considered the experts of their time, today the 'pseudo-scientists' are the 'pagan priests' of our time. Both of these so-called \"experts\", of today and yesteryear, are believed to hold the \"secret\" knowledge of their time. Today's demonic religion is called 'Scientisim', the former was 'Paganism'; they both have a very similar form, and are identical in purpose (i.e. to deceive the world).      Today's religion is Scientisim, and the high-priests are called, \"the experts\".  These so called \"experts\", are and have been, financed, promoted, and run by the \"Global-elite\" i.e. globalists.  These elite-families, the globalists, have been controlling a world-wide narrative, since the beginning of creation, passing their occult ideas and practices along to their progeny.  In modern times, they have been pushing lies through the means of: newspapers, magazines, news-outlets, books, movies, universities, colleges, public-schools, judges, district attorneys, science-fiction-writers, congressmen, senators, presidents( almost all of our presidents were either Freemasons, or had strong ties with the Masons, and most of them have been selected, not elected ), NASA( founded with NAZI war criminals, and run by Freemasons --most astronauts are also Masons or have ties to the occult. ), just to mention a few.  All of these are feeding us a series of lies, designed to make us forget GOD, and meant to make us feel small and insignificant, having nothing but this life to look forward to, along with constantly orchestrated crisis, people are kept in a state of perpetual fear. People kept in fear are easily controlled. Most of these conveyors of misinformation are themselves indoctrinated into believing the lies they promote.  The reason that these elite-families continue this global-charade is in order to keep the rest of the world's population in check, and only a step away from becoming  slaves, while they continue to illicitly accumulate power and wealth, by the sweat and tears of the rest of us. These elite harvest are children to satisfy their ungodly lusts. This has reached a crescendo in our day, with deadly vaccines forced on our children, the harvesting of  Adrenochrome, the practice of pedophilia, and the list goes on.  TRUST IN JESUS CHRIST [He is the ONLY way to be reconciled with God]!      The penalty for our sins is death(eternal torment in a Lake Of Fire), as stated in the Bible;[ Rom 6:23 \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" ].

Think about it for a moment; have you truly looked into the matter, or have you just taken for granted that what someone else said is true, because they claimed to be a teacher or some sort of expert? Anyone looking into these 'experts' claims, would soon find-out that what they claim to be true are all pure speculations, without any supporting data. The reason for their lies, are that either, they have to play along with the mainstream narrative, in order to keep their jobs and feed their families, due to severe indoctrination, along with a lack of interest, or worse yet, in order to promote a world view that allows them to live perverse and ungodly lives; in this manner, they fool themselves in believing that there are no consequences after death.  Evolution is a faith, because it is based exclusively on assumptions that cannot be verified, and as you will see, it actually goes against well established scientific laws. All of the original proponents of this atheistic, evolutionary world view lived depraved lives. Most of them were not scientists, contrary to what you are led to believe, and some were outright con-men. Take Charles Darwin for an example, a child-man that dropped out of medical school and latter out of seminary school. Charles' father got him his first job as a cabin-boy on the HMS Beagle. Charles had no training as a naturalist, he was a lazy flunky, his own father regarded him as a disappointment. It was on the Beagle where he got his perverted ideas regarding evolution. He married his first cousin, because he believed (due to his views on evolution) that it would be a genetic benefit to do so. The majority of his children die, some of suicide, and the rest from genetic problems. Several of his children, the ones that did survive were severely retarded. Another one of these humanists was, Aldous Huxley, he admitted that his zeal in promoting this world view, came from his desire to change societal morays, so as to accommodate his sexual lusts[see, Confession Of A Professed Atheist, 1966] (do a little research into the evolutionary-humanist founding fathers and you will see that they all led perverted lives) The model these 'experts' claim they have, would not qualify as a model in any other field, it has no equations, variables, constants, or statistical assumptions. These models consist of imagination, pictures, and lines on paper, they have no substance. their existence is to promote an atheistic world view; in essence a religious belief. I offer you an exceedingly better 'religious belief', one that has transcended time, it proclaims the true means of creation, all of it's prophecies so far have been fulfilled and many are being fulfilled in our time, all of it's archaeological evidences are true, it describes the nature of fallen man, and it shows us how to be reconciled with GOD. -- remember that there's no man that knows all things, not even a fraction of all there is to be known; do not believe those that say \"there is no God\"  COULD ANY OF YOU EVOLUTIONISTS EXPLAIN THE FOLLOWING \tHOW did the universe come from a dot-of-nothing exploding( i.e. \"The Big-bang\", which is one of the many [idiotic] claims put forth by the so called \u201cexperts\u201d )? WHERE was this dot-of-nothing located? Was it inside of nothing? If so, how were they distinguished, the one from the other? HOW do you give nothing its locality? WHAT was the nature of the agency that caused this dot-of-nothing to explode? I.e. there must have been something else around to cause this dot to explode; HOW else would this dot go from a perpetual static-state to a dynamic one(exploding)? Having established that there must have been an agency in existence prior to the explosion, that would at a future point-of-time, decide to cause this dot to explode, WHERE was this agency located, and HOW do you distinguished it from GOD?    \tHOW does gas come together to form a star, in defiance of Boil's Law?( i.e. you can't compress a gas into a solid ). If we were to ignore Boil's law for the moment, WHERE did the gravitational forces come from that pulled the elements together into forming the first stars?    \tMatter that is traveling in a straight line from an origin at the center of an explosion( i.e. \"The Big-bang\" ), in a vacuum, would continue in a straight line forever, unless something would cause it to alter its trajectory( \"a body in motion will remain in motion\", and it would also take the \"path of least resistance\" ), however, evolutionists say that there was nothing else in existence; WHAT then caused the elements to slow down, and to turn toward each-other so as to fuse together?  Today, if we were to place gas molecules together, in any amount, they will move apart due to collisions, having insufficient gravitational mass to overcome this outward force, WHY are we supposed to believe, that at sometime in the distant past, that this was possible?! If the gravitational pull of stars are needed to form other stars, WHERE did the original stars come from?    \tHOW do you reconcile the observation of an explosion occurring today, which will always result in chaos, with the claim of evolutionists, that order resulted from an explosion that occurred in the ancient past?    \tHOW does a-bio-genesis work in real life? HOW exactly does rain falling on a rock for a long time produce life?    \tYes, we have all been indoctrinated to believe we came from apes, please show me the evidence and step me through the whole process! HAVE you ever seen any kind of animal turn into another kind? For example: a cat into a dog? a mosquito into a whale? I've seen many types of dogs but all remain as dogs, likewise with cats, birds, etc. Show me the many transitional forms in the fossil record. THERE ARE NONE! The only mutations observed are destructive ones(i.e. a loss of information, e.g. eyes disappearing, limbs disappearing, etc.). In order for evolution to work you need the opposite type of mutation, one that will increase information, not decrease it! By the way, destructive mutations are exactly what we would expect to occur in a universe that is slowly dying of radiant-heat loss.    \tThe second law of thermodynamics, information theory, and common seance, clearly show that order(information being a form of order) is lost over time. It is impossible for order to arise without an agency causing it, in our universe!!! This is a very short list of the hundreds of inconsistencies within the religious belief of evolution!  PROBLEMS WITH RADIOMETRIC DATING    \tAs an analogy, think of walking into a room in which you find a burning candle, after being in the room for a while the candle goes out. The only things you can know(while the candle was burning and while you remained in the room) are: the rate at which the candle was burning, and the current atmospheric conditions. You cannot know the original length of the candle before it was lit. You cannot know if the atmospheric conditions in the room were constant before you entered the room(e.g. did the oxygen/nitrogen levels vary over time?), you can not know if the candle burned at the same rate before you entered the room. Likewise with carbon dating: you do not know how much of the 'daughter' product(C14) was present in the specimen at the time of death. You cannot know how much of the 'parent' product(N2) was available in the atmosphere prior to the time of death (e.g. air pockets found in amber show that O2 levels were around 32% at the time the pine sap solidified; proving that the atmosphere was vastly different in the past. Current level of O2 is around 20%). Further more, you cannot know if the levels of solar radiation (a major contributor in converting N2 -> C14) were different from today's, prior to the death of the specimen. - This is just an excerpt of the things that would not be known to us. Carbon dating along with any other radiometric dating method are useless, due to insufficient data. Furthermore, there are vast ( and proven ) age differences in Radiometric results, found while dating the same specimen at different sites (these differences also occur when re-dating a specimen at the same site).

The example given was between two different species; one where males and females are the same size on average, and another where males are larger on average. The example is meant to demonstrate sexual selection, where females chose the biggest, strongest males, so males became larger and more aggressive on average. He did not say that the larger a demographic is within a species, the more aggressive they are, nor did he even say that the larger a species is, the more aggressive it is; only that males typically being larger than females in a given species can be an indicator of males typically being more aggressive than females. This is a binary example (either M=F or M>F), not a gradient one, and is about the size of males compared to females, not the overall size of both within a population. And that difference (men larger than women) is there for our entire species, on average. It's not like Bl men are larger than Bl women, and for everyone else they're normally the same size. And whaddaya know, men tend to be more aggressive than women.  For all humans, men are larger than women on average, regardless of demographic, and scaling up both doesn't change that.

This is the message of forgiveness of sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In first Corinthians, chapter 15 verses 1 to 4, the apostle Paul states:  \u201cMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you, first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures\u201d.  Romans chapter 3 verse 23, informs us,   \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God\u201d.    Ultimately it is a redeeming plan set by God, and for anybody who will faithfully trust in his Son will be saved.   Romans chapter 6 verse 23, says,  \u201cFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\u201d.  A sinner must recognise the despairing of her or his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take effect.   Every believer must understand in order to inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king, the reality and foundational truth of sin must be acknowledged, for all who approach the throne of God for salvation.   God promises us eternal life, for anybody who departs from sin through the saving faith in Jesus Christ.     Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life which no person could live. Jesus\u2019s sacrifice on the cross ultimately paid the debt we owe to God for our sin.  Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice; and Jesus died a substitutionary death for the sinner.   In short, the works of Jesus paid the penalty of sin through an infinite sacrifice. Only the creator of life has the power to resurrect life after death and is essentially the proof of the power of God.  Jesus Christ offers his salvation as a free gift and only be received by faith, despite any works or worthiness on our part.   The scripture in Romans informs us,  \u201cIf you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u201d.  In conclusion, the resurrection of Christ is to bring everlasting life and salvation to anybody who follows him. The relationship between God and man can be restored through his saving faith.", "votes": "0", "replies": "2", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "Ugy5zEHl-BUHFgqurfx4AaABAg", "comment": "From animals we have self regulating processes.brain with a different regulator...", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Y0Oa4Lp5fLE", "cid": "UgzRH8RWdwa4AspOUvN4AaABAg", "comment": "Legal science simplifies all of knowledge into practical behavior.
