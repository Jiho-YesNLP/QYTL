Sensible heat refers to the heat energy transfer that results in a change of temperature in a substance. The energy is used to increase the kinetic energy of the molecules and causes a rise in temperature.\r \r Latent heat, on the other hand, refers to the heat energy transfer that takes place during a phase change, such as melting or boiling, without causing a change in temperature. The energy is used to break the bonds between the molecules and change the phase of the substance, without increasing its temperature. This type of heat energy is latent because it is hidden, as it is not reflected in the temperature change of the substance.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
