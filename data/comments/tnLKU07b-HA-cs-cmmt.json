But you are mistaken about its speed. On average both Booth's algorithm and the conventional method have exactly the same number of multiplications and hence Booth's algorithm is not faster. In fact, on average, Booth's algorithm will be slower on more multipliers than the conventional method if you examine all 2^N possible multipliers for a N bit multiplier. For instance, look at the 32 possibilities for a 5 bit multiplier, after each possibility I'll indicate the number of additions for Booth and the number for the conventional approach: 00000 = 0 0\r 00001 = 2 1\r 00010 = 2 1\r 00011 = 2 2\r 00100 = 2 1\r 00101 = 4 2\r 00110 = 2 2\r 00111 = 2 3\r 01000 = 2 1\r 01001 = 4 2\r 01010 = 4 2\r 01011 = 4 3\r 01100 = 2 2\r 01101 = 4 3\r 01110 = 2 3\r 01111 = 2 4\r 10000 = 1 1\r 10001 = 3 2\r 10010 = 3 2\r 10011 = 3 3\r 10100 = 3 2\r 10101 = 5 3\r 10110 = 3 3\r 10111 = 3 4\r 11000 = 1 2\r 11001 = 3 3\r 11010 = 3 3\r 11011 = 3 4\r 11100 = 1 3\r 11101 = 3 4\r 11110 = 1 4\r 11111 = 1 5   Notice that both approaches have a total of 80 additions over the entire set of 32 multipliers. Additionally, where the counts differ, Booth \"wins\" 10 times, while the conventional approach wins 13 times. The reason that the conventional method wins more often than Booth, while they both have the same total number of additions is because when the conventional method \"wins\", it wins by a small margin, while when Booth wins, it wins by a large margin. If you examine longer multipliers, you'll see that the pattern continues. They both take the exact same number of total additions when all possible multipliers are considered and when one of the algorithms uses fewer additions, the conventional algorithm is faster more often than Booth.  Now, there is another advantage of Booth when multiplying in hardware. Namely, Booth requires fewer \"hard multiples\" when using a higher radix. For instance, Radix-4 Booth examines 3 bits at a time and shifts by 2 bits each iteration. The table looks as follows: 0 0 0: 0 0 0 1: 1N 0 1 0: 1N\r 0 1 1: 2N 1 0 0: -2N\r 1 0 1: -1N\r 1 1 0: -1N\r 1 1 1: 0 Notice that 1N, 2N, -1N, and -2N need to be computed and potentially used for each iteration. All of those multiples are easy since they're nothing more than a routing of a wire and a logical not of a routed wire. On the other hand, a conventional Radix-4 would need to get the following multiples: 1N, 2N, 3N. The 3N is a \"hard multiple\" in that it requires a full blow addition operation along with the associated propagation of a carry, making the hardware more complicated and potentially slower.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "tnLKU07b-HA", "cid": "UgxoG2VtV9yrv609OMl4AaABAg", "comment": "Cool!
