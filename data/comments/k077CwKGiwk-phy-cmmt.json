Watch the two videos listed below to learn about current and the conduction process and surface charges (using a unified approach to electrostatics and circuits) which set up the electric field whose line integral is the potential difference.

The charge carriers flow in the direction of the emf arrow in a circuit diagram and in the case of an electron, the direction will be from the positive terminal to the negative terminal (because the electron is a negative charge carrier). The motion of the charge carriers is opposite that of which they would have due to an electric field between the two terminals.
