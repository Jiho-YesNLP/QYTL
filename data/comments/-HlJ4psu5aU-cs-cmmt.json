It also doesn't require inspection of the data that is being transmitted in any way by the intermediaries.  \"Virtual Circuit Switching\" on the other hand has a different physical set up. All connections exist at the same time, just as with any other form of packet switching, but the data packets belonging to the same message \"remember\" which path the other ones took and subsequently all take that same path too.
