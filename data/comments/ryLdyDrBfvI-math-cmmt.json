The idea is that if those is two points get closer and closer to the point where the distance between them becomes 0, then that calculated slope would be identical to the slope of the tangent line.  Bottom line. It \u2018approaches 0\u2019 in the sense that we calculate values as if the distance is 0.

Think of it as an Arithmetic progression ,where in order to get to a smaller number the common difference has to be negative. Or just make a graph of distance versus time.. Since,we know that the tangent of the graph of distance versus time gives us the speed.(tangent or slope tells us the ratio of rise and run along a graph). To get to lesser height ,the y coordinates will shift down but the time x coordinate will keep on increasing and the tangent along that line would be negative because a smaller value- bigger value gives us a negative value.

Like if we think x0 = 2, then in LH we are saying that x tends to 2(meaning some value of x could be 1.999 with an epsilon error of 0.001). But in RHS, all of a sudden, he is plugging in the value of x = 2(instead of 1.999). He is essentially throwing that epsilon error (which is the premise of Limit theory) on RHS. Now it would not be a problem, if it is just an approximation(where we are happy with having that epsilon error rate).

For instance, let's say that the limit of f(x) as x approach to x0, is L. What does it means? It means \"EACH epsilon>0 you take, you can find a real number, let's call it delta, so that |f(x)-L|<delta when |x-x0|<epsilon\". Now you can demonstrate that lim of (x-x0) as x approach to x0, is zero, just following my definition of limit. You have to fix an epsilon error, every positive number is good (for example 0.0001). I have to find a delta so that |f(x)-L|=|x-x0-0|<delta when |x-x0|<epsilon. You should see that you can choose delta=epsilon, because it's clearly true that |x-x0|<epsilon when |x-x0|<epsilon. So I found my delta, and I demonstrated that lim(x->x0)x-x0=0. Now it is true that dividing by zero is not allowed by the real number axioms! But the professor is not dividing by zero, but he is applying the limit operation to (f(x)-f(x0))/x-x0, and x is not equal to x0. There is a theorem that says \"the limit of the product is the product of the limits\",  so that the limit of the right side is equals to the limit of (f(x)-f(x0))/x-x0 multiplied the limit of x-x0.

Shouldn't it be a number closer to zero(but still non-zero)?  What I am saying is that he says x-x0 != 0. Meaning x != x0. So how did we get x-x0 to be zero in second term? If he gets x-x0 to be zero, it means x == x0. But in first statement he uses x!=x0.  I mean we multiplied and divided by a non-zero number(non-zero being the key here). If that's the case, it means that x-x0 is non-zero. Then how can it become zero all of a sudden in the next equation? I understand the definition of limit, but it just seems weird that they are using two definitions when trying to refer to same value which is x-x0.

Obviously you can devide for a number that is not zero. It is 0.001? No, It is lower. Maybe 0.00000000000001? No, it is smaller. Smaller than every number, but not zero!  So, in the right side, we have the derivative of the function (that is a finite number) multiplied by that strange number that is smaller than everything, that strange number that is the closest number to zero. But this product is clearly zero, don't you think? The professor needs to give a name for this limit, he calls it zero, because it behaves like a zero. You might think that the differentiation is an approximation and in a certain way you're right, but is the closest approximation to reality, so close that can be confused with the reality itself. Just like lim (x-x0) is the closest thing to zero. Anyway, if you don't like math, in my opinion, it's because no one taught correctly to you.

Stated equivalently,\u00a0a function f(x) is continuous at the point x0 iff the [lim as x->xo of f(x)] - \u00a0f(x0) \u00a0is equal to zero. 3. So Let Z = [the lim as x->x0 of f(x)] - f(x0) \u00a0(and we'll see if we can get it to come out zero somehow). 4. Z =\u00a0[the lim as x->x0 of f(x)] \u00a0- \u00a0[the lim as x->x0 of f(x0)]. 5. Z = the lim as x->x0 of [f(x) - f(x0)]. 6. Z = the lim as x->x0 of [f(x) - f(x0)]\u00a0* \u00a0{ [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] / [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] }. 7. Z =\u00a0the lim as x->x0 of { [f(x) - f(x0)] /\u00a0[lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] } * \u00a0[lim x->x0 of (x-x0)]. 8. Z =\u00a0the lim as x->x0 of { [f(x) - f(x0)] / (x-x0) } * [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)]. 9. Z = f'(x0)\u00a0* [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)]. \u00a0(a critical step. \u00a0it removes the divide-by-zero\u00a0conundrum.) 10.\u00a0Z = f'(x0) * 0. 11. Z = 0.  Therefore, Given the existence of f'(x0), \u00a0which makes step 9 possible,\u00a0the [lim as x->xo of f(x)] - \u00a0f(x0) \u00a0is equal to zero, and consequently the given function is continuous.  This is proof by demonstrating that the hypothesis plays an indispensable role in the conclusion. \u00a0Not my favorite method (by far!), but in the absence of a review of the algebra of absolute values and in the absence of an introduction of the epsilon-delta definition of a limit, I can't see how else the professor could have done it.
