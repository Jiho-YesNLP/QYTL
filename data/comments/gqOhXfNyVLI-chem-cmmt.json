Just for fun, here is a neat story about radiocarbon dating: In the year 1700 there was a tsunami that happened in the Pacific Northwest. Scientists studied dead trees in the ghost forest of Copalis (Washington State). Dendrochronology, the study of tree rings, showed that the last year of growth occurred in 1699, so the trees were dead by the spring of 1700. Carbon dating of the trees showed that the trees died somewhere between 1680 to 1720. Researchers interviewed the Native American people to find out when the tsunami occurred and according to their oral history, the tsunami occurred around approximately the year 1700. In Japan they kept a careful written history and from that historical account we know the tsunami occurred January 26th, 1700. This was an \u201corphan tsunami\u201d which means it was not caused by an earthquake local to Japan. Geologists studied the sand layer that was deposited by the tsunami and dating confirmed that the sediment was deposited around the year 1700.\r This is just a beautiful example of how multiple lines of evidence can be used in science.", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gqOhXfNyVLI", "cid": "UgxeXr3a6Zmxj6utpeF4AaABAg", "comment": "Nice sir!", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "gqOhXfNyVLI", "cid": "UgzqRSmZJGX8XqY09tN4AaABAg.A6rKb0bidJ1A6rezsnKVdt", "comment": "Excellent and thank you!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "gqOhXfNyVLI", "cid": "UgzeBDkNKemmDlcqQ2Z4AaABAg.A2sjeeAye8VA2u7eVKPCdx", "comment": "Way to go!
