We want to find the scores that mark the middle 20% of the data (10% on each side of the middle line that separates the two halves of the distribution). 20% (20 out of 100) is the same as saying 0.2000 (0.2 out of 1). The whole area under the curve is 1 (or 100%). You only want the middle 0.2000 (or 0.1000 on each side of the central line). The area you do NOT want is the entire area (1) minus the area of interest (0.2000). Divide that by 2 so you can focus on the first half of the distribution. This way you obtain 0.4000. You could obtain the exact same result by considering half of the whole area (1/2 = 0.5000) and subtracting 0.1000 from it.  In order words, 0.4000 represents the first part of the area that you do NOT want to consider. When you find the z-score for 0.4000 and convert it to x, you'll find the lower limit of your interval (the lower score that marks the middle 20% of the data). Below that limit lies the 40% that you do NOT want to consider. For the upper limit, you can do the exact same thing on the other half of the area (in this case the z-score will be the opposite). Above that limit lies the 40% that you do NOT want to consider. In between   Hope this helps!

And by the way in my country Public Education is of way higher quality and respected than private colleges. All you need to do is study and pass the exams to get in, and of course out too.  Don' t you feel that things would be a lot better if people that want to get educated all over the world pressured their goverments in order to organise a high-level, free and respected Public Education for everyone interested to learn?
