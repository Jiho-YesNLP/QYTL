They r a 6 billion letter code. Dna is made of small repeating units (polymers) called nucleotides. Link them together and u have a polynucleotide. A nucleotide is made of-  \u2022 A five carbon sugar molecule called deoxyribose \u2022 A phosphate group \u2022 One of 4 nitrogen bases- adenine, thymine go together and cytosine and guanine go together. G and C pairing is stronger Structure of dna is double helix(a twisted ladder) its main support is the sugar and phosphate binding together to form 2 twin backbones. These run in opposite directions, O2 pointing up and O2 pointing down. The left hand chain is from 5 prime to 3 prime and the opposite on the right hand chain. Rna- has only 1 sugar phosphate backbone \u2022 so it is a single stranded molecule, sugar is ribose (one O2 more)not deoxyribose  \u2022 Has uracil instead of thymine Replication- copying of cells, helicase is an enzyme that unwinds the hydrogen bonds of the nitrogen bases, the point where the splitting starts is the replication fork. Top strand- leading strand and bottom strand called lagging strand. These go in opposite directions such that making dna from leading strand is easier than for lagging strand. Leading strand- rna polymerase, an enzyme adds matching nitrogen bases. Rna primase provides a primase which helps the enzyme to make a new dna strand. Lagging strand- rna polymerase can only copy dna in 5 prime to 3 prime direction so the copying is done in segments and using many other dna polymerase eg dna ligase", "votes": "19", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8kK2zwjRV0M", "cid": "UgzeDKfI5_9giuYgyFt4AaABAg", "comment": "these brothers really be out here doing God's work what would I do without them", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "8kK2zwjRV0M", "cid": "Ugz_FKPy5sTO0rlm8iF4AaABAg", "comment": "hank: Hey. wanna make one.
