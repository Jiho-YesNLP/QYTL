This is my two cents: The mycodeschool channel is good, short, and straight to the points without losing much detail. The MIT course is way too long and academic but it is good if you have the time, which I didn\u2019t so I skipped it. The Algorithm book by Prof. Segdewick is a book for the second course in CS, which focuses mostly on the fundamental yet important data structures, how they are implement in Java, as well as some associated algorithmic problems. The book doesn\u2019t mention Algorithm design techniques (again, mostly on data structures and not design techniques). Then, the Algorithm Design Manual by Prof. Skiena is a book for a course followed by the Data Structure course (usually named \"Design and Analysis of Algorithms\"). This book briefly talks about data structures and doesn\u2019t talk about how they are implemented. It assumes readers know the basics of data structures. It focuses on Algorithm design techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, etc. The following is my recommended learning path if you have over 8 months and not much background in CS: Pick a language and learn the basics of it (Java), watch the mycodeschool playlist on Data Structures, read the \u201cAlgorithm\u201d textbook by Prof. Sedgewick alongside with his two Coursera courses (which use his textbook), read Prof. Skiena\u2019s \u201cThe Algorithm Design Manual\u201d alongside with the Stanford algorithm course on Coursera (optional in my opinion, because it uses the CLRS textbook and talks about a lot of math. Watch it if you want to pursue a CS master/phd\u00a0and and pursue the academic route instead of industry). Then buy the CtCi or Elements of Programming Interviews book AND use Leetcode to practice solving algorithmic problems for interviews. Finally, buy the CLRS/Knuth\u2019s classic books as a lifetime reference. All these books work well TOGETHER and serve different purposes! If you are short on time AND have some background in CS (preferably Data Structures, OOD, and programming basics), then I'd recommend skipping Sedgewick's Algorithm book and start from Skiena's book on design techniques and then CiTi/EPI + LeetCode + Mock interviews.

It was mainly founded and created by Animesh, the voice you hear in most of the videos is Animesh. Humblefool was his friend and senior. Later Animesh asked Humblefool to worked with him and they both worked together. I don't know what exactly happened now, but Animesh is alive and he works in google, I dunno maybe he is too much busy. Later when initiatives like geekforgeeks came maybe he thought that he has done his part and the rest will be on the hands of others. Because in mycodeschool website you can find the link for geeksforgeeks. Geekforgeeks also founded by an IITian. Anyway, I miss Animesh so much, he just created my basics of programming so well that I hardly stuck on any problem now. I just hope Animesh will come back one day and again starts making videos.
