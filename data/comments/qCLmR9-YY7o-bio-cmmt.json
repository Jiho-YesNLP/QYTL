Yes, it is science, but is science not a miracle?  It seems pretty miraculous to me.  The more we know and understand, the more we understand that we don't know.  A well-known quote by Albert Einstein is that, \"There are only two ways to live your life: as though nothing is a miracle, or as though everything is a miracle.\"  Although it is, and perhaps because it is more humbling, I choose the latter.  In part because the more we learn, the more we realize that there are many things we don't know.    I have the conviction that not only is all science a miracle, but that all miracles are done by science.  That our all-knowing God works by set laws of science to bring about his eternal purposes, like creating the Earth to start with, including the use of many laws of science that we know nothing about yet, but will someday.  I believe that science and the spiritual are one. That spiritual phenomenon work on scientific laws and scientific phenomenon work on spiritual laws.  That spiritual phenomenon are simply on a higher, more pure or advanced plane than what we think of as scientific phenomenon.  So, does science bring us closer to the Master Scientist or farther away?  That depends on whether we come to think we know everything, or whether, as Einstein and many scientists do, we wisely and humbly come to realize how much knowledge we lack.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "UgyRpoHVOdrAseCrPxp4AaABAg", "comment": "9:46 the girl at the right is so cute\ud83d\ude02", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "UgyboFKb-eKFo8EBXzd4AaABAg", "comment": "\ud83d\ude0a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "UgwZRTDLuj4a-6JloSV4AaABAg", "comment": "\ud83d\uddfd\ud83d\uddfd", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "Ugwl2EcTDnfHGI_MqQh4AaABAg", "comment": "6:04 I love the way he says that, the inflection of his voice.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "Ugz49ZUYaMLKbN4wZ-R4AaABAg", "comment": "Still using this seven years later", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "Ugxg_lcspZvZzxO_6U14AaABAg", "comment": "Plz make a video on animal kingdom", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "Ugwu9hjnALSD7jvjEJN4AaABAg", "comment": "Loved your teaching from india", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qCLmR9-YY7o", "cid": "Ugy_3ncMcd9dV1s4LlZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Who can explain to me what is bivalent , tetrad , homologous chromosomes , sister chromatid , what are their different ...

Somatic cells clone themselves through the process of mitosis 2. When two things aren't identical but have the \"same relation\" they're called homologous  3. Cells that have half of a full set of chromosomes are called haploid 4. When a specialized diploid cell splits in half twice, the process is called meiosis 5. During interphase I, the cell undergoes DNA Replication (long strings of DNA begin to duplicate) 6. In which phase do crossover and homologous recombination occur? Meiosis 1 7. Which pair of chromosomes does not always go through crossover or recombination? 23rd pair (sex chromosomes) 8. The X and Y chromosomes do not match up because they are not homologous 9. The pairs of homologous chromosomes line up during metaphase 1 10. The homologous pairs get pulled apart and migrate to either end of the cell during anaphase 1 11. The result of meiosis phase I is 2 haploid cells  12. In prophase II the process is exactly the same as mitosis, except that there is no DNA replication 13. During telophase II, the chromosomes uncoil into chromatin 14. The result of meiosis phase II is 4 haploid cells (23 chromosomes each) 15. The sex-determining chromosome comes from a sperm and egg 16. During egg production, one gamete is much larger.

He has ovaries (scrotum) that come with embryos in them just as she does. His sperm comes from a split of the original embryos just as hers does.

So, this is a more natural way of gaining higher reproductive rates, that is neither hurting the animals nor limiting the animals as much.  This could be used to help animals gain muscle as well. This means less locking animals in cages as much, and not feeding them so  much, to the point of being so unhealthy that it hurts the animals bodies).' love that the advertisements  are more targeted at specific audiences.

In fact they CAN get tangled and exchange genes, and because they aren't homologous this can result in some really interesting situations in which some of the Y chromosome's DNA can cross over to an X chromosome during spermatogenic (sperm-making) meiosis. This X chromosome may then fertilise the ovum (which always has one X chromosome), and what you get is a fertilised ovum with two X chromosomes, but with some Y chromosome DNA too (even though there's no Y chromosome in the cells).  Usually, this doesn't affect anything, but there's a not-small chance that the gene that crosses over to the X chromosome will be a gene called \"SRY-1\", or \"sex-determining region-1\". This is the \"trigger\" for the production of testes, the genes for which are actually already on the X chromosome. This causes a zygote with two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome to develop testes (though, they cannot produce sperm because they lack the other parts of the Y chromosome), and thus develop as partially or wholly phenotypically male-typical. This is one of the many kinds of *intersex condition*, and the specific name for this condition is \"SRY-1 Positive de la Chapelle's Syndrome\".   Intersex people make sex determination WAY more complicated than just XX/XY, especially since chromosomes are overruled by hormone levels later in the gestation.

There was 11 billion years between the big bang and cells 'showing up'.

As they replicated over billions of years, random mutations occured and some of them attracted other molecules such as phosphates and lipids; forming cell membranes and the first cells. So as you see, nothing biological really 'just showed up'.
