Intelligence come from birth 1day to 6 month baby kid age time science subjects sounds listening 10 hours per day by New born baby's child from near environment before 2 year age baby kids.

New born  baby kid only 1 need in day  time is science subjects sounds, music, baby kids not need day time sleep. Baby kid catch every sound in only this critical age and start activation of brain cells,myelin sheaths only in baby kids before 2 year age time. This is New brain research on human kid brain. So you share with newspaper,science community, teachers,friends,kids.Yes extreme sleep is big mistake for New born baby kid before 2 year age  time. before 2 year age baby kids only 1 need in day time is science subject Sounds listening . All human 100% & 2 trillion brain commanding neurone cells active, working ,it means  super great genius scientist,honesty, happy,peace. No war,no greedy. Why a couple 4 kid different in intelligence level\u2753Why we all human defferent in intelligence level\u2753= I solved this mistry in this massage., read this message again and again.This is a pure science research on human new born kid brain cells activation, working. Why all students not interested in  fundamental subject,  necessary for life, biology, human body functioning, cells,organs , physics, chemistry, Math \u2753in human brain commanding neurone cell 2 trillion but in we all , all brain neurone cells not active,not working,, because we not listen sounds before 2 year age baby kid age time. Every stupid human done only sleep before 2 year age baby kids age time. With this new brain research now we change everything globally. In near future every human New born baby kids think and become genius scientist with simple scientific process 100% active brain cells & working brain commanding neurone cells.\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udd0a\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd31\ud83e\udd31\ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f\ud83d\udce1\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\ud83d\udcbb\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf0e live example. \ud83d\udc49This 3 year little genius girl expert of biology science name=Brielle and this 11 year genius boy  in math,physics. name Sarim Khan.

E.g. the last column is the noble gases: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn.  Then right before it are the the halogens, so another nice column: F, Cl, Br, I At (they all end in \"-ine\", and it's good to order them by size, because it will become useful later anyway, for studying alkyl halides and substitution reactions). Another nice part is the first and second column of the alkali metals (\"s\" orbitals): Li, Na, K (all +1 spectator ions that form strong bases with -OH hydronium ions), and their 2+ counterparts: Be, Mg, Ca. (You can memorize the remaining three heavier elements in each of these columns if you want to, or if you work in a firework factory ;) because they usually give nice colors when burned in a flame, so it is good to associate them with those colors when memorizing them.)  Then there's the non-metals and semi-metals part (for \"p\" orbitals). The first row is easy, because it's the basis for organic chemistry and life: B, C, N, O (sorted by electronegativity, and by the number of valence electrons: 3, 4, 5, 6), boron being the odd ball with incomplete octet, which makes it useful for those borohydrides that you will learn about in ochem as being good reducing agents and sources of nucleophilic hydrogens, a.k.a. hydride ions. They have their heavier cousins in the next row: Al, Si, P, S. And again, aluminum works pretty much the same as boron with that incomplete octet and hydrides (sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride). Silicon is just heavier carbon, and phosphorus is just heavier nitrogen, and sulfur is just heavier oxygen, but they all have this extra ability of extending their octet if needed. You can also remember that selenium is under sulfur, if you already know that the amino acid \"cysteine\" contains sulfur, and its cousin \"selenocysteine\" contains selenium instead, because these two atoms are interchangeable due to their similar chemical properties. As for Al and Si, these are the two most abundant elements in Earth's crust, so you can group them by that. If you need the next row too, then you probably work with semiconductors ;) because here are the metals and SEMI-metals used for SEMIconductors (both start with \"semi-\", so there's your hint right there ;) ). Gallium is that metal that melts in your hand, used for P-type semiconductors, because it has 1 electron less than silicon or germanium; germanium is what diodes are made of, because it's just below silicon (also a semi-conductor); and arsenic is for N-type semiconductors, because it has 1 electron more than silicon or germanium. So that's a pretty big part of the periodic table (and most useful) memorized! :> If you need transition metals (with \"d\" orbitals) too, then again, look for patterns. All the \"precious\" metals (copper, silver, gold) are in one column, and it is this column that is the \"exception\" for the \"d\" orbitals (the penultimate one). Other interesting metals are flanking it: Pd and Pt on the left are the well-known catalysts; on the right: cadmium is for batteries, and mercury is the \"quicksilver\" liquid metal that is used in gold mining because it makes amalgams with gold. Nickel and zinc are flanking copper. Now try filling up the first row of the \"d\" block yourself, because this will be the most useful one. If you need more, again: learn them in columns, with \"heavier cousins\" of the ones from the first row, having the same chemical properties as them.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "-jJz5OMmuP0", "cid": "UgxuW1Bs0_pcXbzTqnV4AaABAg.9JDAQsDyrjCA--Ji2H8YwR", "comment": "College in the US is a joke.
