When you hold a ball still above the ground, it has no kinetic energy but \"x\" potential energy (x is just some energy, it doesn't matter what it is). Then, you drop the ball. As the ball falls to the ground, that potential energy is being transformed into kinetic energy. In that sense, potential energy is decreasing while kinetic energy is decreasing. Right before the ball makes contact with the ground, the all of the potential energy from when it's in your hand is kinetic energy. Work is a force being done over a distance, so something is moving. That something is losing potential energy, just like our ball. So the sign for translating work into potential is negative.", "votes": "11", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
