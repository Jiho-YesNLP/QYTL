So, you need two given values at any time to find the RH. To find the RH as the video explains you need the partial / vapor x 100% to find the RH. To find the Vapor Pressure of any given temperature you'll use the antoine formula which is log10P = a - b/c+temperature which you can find the constants of abc for water a = 8.07131, b = 1730.63, and c = 238.426 to find your vapor pressure. But once you have the vapor pressure, the only way to find the partial pressure is to have both the RH and the VP but to find the RH, you need both the PP & the VP. In the end, I can use a hygrometer to find my dew point & my RH.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqFVtlQa-2w", "cid": "Ugzq11nLVERbo0FtwtB4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks , very good explanatory video", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqFVtlQa-2w", "cid": "UgwB7_z_XPM9gAiF1hd4AaABAg", "comment": "Thank you, but how do you calculate the partial pressure of water vapor?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqFVtlQa-2w", "cid": "UgzT47KQ6xky8mcUyHV4AaABAg", "comment": "Brilliant explanation", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqFVtlQa-2w", "cid": "Ugwi2fKDdmD342ShaR94AaABAg", "comment": "thanks", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "BqFVtlQa-2w", "cid": "UgzHdaaf2pZ_L2aBUrF4AaABAg", "comment": "Mannnn this was just a TINNNYYYY bit over my head.

Then, if you decrease the temperature of that unsaturated ideal gas, it's partial pressure should also be decreased as per the pressure law.  It shouldn't be still 27 torr at dew point 27 centigrade.
