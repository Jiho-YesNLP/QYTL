What I learned is that the most important math concept is that of the pure number. Derivatives and integrals are pure numbers, as are fractions, ratios, percentages, geometry, trig, slopes, thermo entropy, and a bunch of other things. In other words, we were introduced to the overarching concept of all calculus back in the third grade, but no one bothered to explain its importance.
