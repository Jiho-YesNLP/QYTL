Hence, every x is some linear combination of these n basis vectors.  The same T  is acting on every vector in that space, and since we have n (in this example n = 8) dimensions, we need to know how T acts on any 8 independent vectors from that space in order to describe this T completely. Think in two dimensions: a plane. If you know how T acts on 2 points on that plane (two vectors), you know how it acts on the whole plane.  By \"how it acts\" I mean: what is the output vector, i.e., its coordinates after applying T. (Take any one point, apply T and look where it landed in that plane.)  The two vectors that you choose will be the basis vectors. You can, for example, decide that you put the whole plane in the Cartesian coordinate system with orthogonal  x and y axes, and chose your two basis vectors to be v1 = (x1 coordinate, y1 coordinate) = (1, 0), and v2 = (0,1). Let's take a vector b = (2,3), meaning its x-coordinate is 2 and y-coordinate is 3. It is a linear combination of your two special basis vectors (in this coordinate system, also known as 'orts'): b = 2*v1 + 3* v2. For this 'standard ' basis, it's easy to immediately see what the combination coefficient are. They are just the coordinates. Your standard basis is just I (identity matrix). For any chosen basis, V, you have: b = V*[column of coordinates].  (b is the same as vector x; I just didn't want to use the same letter as for the x-axis, but let's go back to 'x' notation for any vector.)  You can, then, describe a transformation T with a matrix A , which multiplies any vector x from that space. The elements of the matrix A are a11, ... a1n, a21, ... a2n, ... ... an1, ... ann. The columns of that matrix (you also consider them vectors), each,  multiply the basis matrix V, and each matrix*vector product gives an output (transformed) vector, of course, in the same basis V: T(x) = lin. comb. of T(vi).
