Furthermore 0 < x < e^2 is the same as 0 < x < e and hence the confusion later on with points of inflection when in fact it should have been said that: in the interval 0 < x < e (subset of the entire domain) the function is decreasing since df^2 is less than zero and then from e < x < +infinity, the function is increasing since df^2 is greater than zero.
