E=MC2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. What are the EARTH/ground AND the SUN are CLEARLY E=MC2 AND F=ma IN BALANCE. Very importantly, outer \"space\" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

It does ALL CLEARLY make perfect sense. GOT IT !!!! THE SKY is BLUE, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. Great !!! Now, think about the man who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Perfect !!!!  Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. \"Mass\"/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

TIME DILATION ultimately proves ON BALANCE that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. News flash ! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. The Earth (A PLANET) is a MIDDLE DISTANCE form that is in BALANCED relation to the Sun AND the speed of light (c), AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma.

In space, there is a space shuttle that does't move.  Mass of this shuttle is always constant. This space shuttle has a rocket engine which produce a constant force of 100N. When the engine is started and the ship has a constant thrust of 100N, when the ship starts to accelerate, will the acceleration be constant and remain constant (let's assume 10m / s), or maybe the acceleration will start to decrease as the speed increases? It is related to the rule Ek = 1 / 2mv ^ 2 ???  2. Same space shuttle doesnt move. Shuttle start to accelerate from 0km/h to 10km/h in 5 seconds and it takes \"X\" energy for example. How much energy it will needed to accelerate also 10km/h more in also in 5 seconds when it allready have velocity of 100km/h ? Also \"X\" energy? Or much more \"X\" of energy?
