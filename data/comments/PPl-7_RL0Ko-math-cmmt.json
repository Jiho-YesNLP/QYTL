M(t) records the maximum value of brownian motion in the time interval (0, t). tau_a records the first time brownian motion attains the value of a. moreover, since (by definition of brownian motion) B(0) = 0 and t -> B(t) is a continuous function, then brownian motion starts from 0 and cannot jump in value, i.e. (1) to reach the value of a it must go through all of the values between 0 and a first, and (2) to reach the value greater than a it must reach the value of a first, which i can summarize as follows if 0< b < a < c, then tau_b < tau_a < tau_c. what i'm trying to say is that because of the two mentioned defining properties of brownian motion tau_a not only records for you the moment when brownian motion first attained the value of a, but also implicitly tells you, that in the past it never exceeded the value of a, and so it must be, that M(tau_a) = a. now, to answer your question, if we assume that tau_a < t, then from what i said above at time t maximum value of browinan motion M(t) is at least as big as it was at time tau_a, namely M(tau_a) = a, and if it is greater than a, then it must have reached this greater value after time tau_a. however if at time tau_a brownian motion will bounce off of the value of a and never reach it again in the span of time interval (tau_a, t), then its maximum value will be the one that was recored at time tau_a, i.e. M(t) = M(tau_a) = a. on the contrary if we assume, that M(t) > a, then well M(t) > a. an this is the reason, why i'm worrying, that the equality P(M(t)>a) = P(tau_a<t) might not always be true.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PPl-7_RL0Ko", "cid": "UgwHtPNFSflOgAlaVsR4AaABAg.8itXlUmLng_9C9WTSlnv1n", "comment": "micha\u0142 botor i have this same confusion.

The line he writes down then, the third line, is where I don't fully understand. I'ts a simple proof but for some reason I'm struggling here. The third line says; \"probability of the process ending up above \"a\", at time \"t\", given it hits \"a\" before time \"t\"....+ the same for ending up below \"a\" at time \"t\"... basically.. if we've already hit \"a\" before time \"t\" (given that Tau<t).. the probability of ending up, either below or above \"a\" at time \"t\".. to me that should be 1.. and I can't see the connection between that line and the line before... He even says it a second later \"if you know that Tau is less than \"t\" there's only two possible ways, up or down\"... that's true, but we don't know that Tau is less than \"t\".. ?

Since brownian motion processes are invariant under shifts you can also define the process such that the brownian motion starts at the current log of the stock price. When you undo the logarithm, this effectively results in the % returns being normally distributed around 0.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PPl-7_RL0Ko", "cid": "UggZYdQDjERho3gCoAEC.85jdLn8ComL9_2Y2eB5VBX", "comment": "\u00a0@robertvolgman6590\u00a0 Thanks for the reply, Robert.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
