Look at the surface x and y span, may need to sketch it out. If they are not constant (like the box at the end's sample problem), you will need to find x in terms of y or y in terms of x depending on which you want to integrate first.   The part I'm least sure about is 4. In the main example, we have x + y + z = 1, and use (1, 0) and (0, 1). The reason we ignore z seems to be because we already have the integral in terms of x and y. Let's say we have ax + by + cz = d. More simply, we use ax + by = d. It seems like the points we use for the sketch is where the other variable = 0, or ax = d, or by = d.   Idk if that is even right tho, is it? and what about other cases, too--besides something where its just constants for x and y like the sample prob at the end [And assuming the graphs of them are not just given to you to make it easy to see]  OH and how do we calc whether or not it is positively oriented", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QS-zUSu-nxA", "cid": "Ugwp-Y-fNzgUTHzmJat4AaABAg", "comment": "Stokes\u2019 \u201ctharem\u201d -.-", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QS-zUSu-nxA", "cid": "Ugzx5QnqNKbivBiFByx4AaABAg", "comment": "To be honest you are single handedly saying my calculus grade!
