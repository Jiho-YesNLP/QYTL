Perhaps, the sqrt(x) and maybe something else throughout all the transformations. Firstly, it would've demostrated the consistency of the methods as opposed to just ways to manipulate quadratic function graph specifically. Secondly, some of the transformations are confusing when applied to x^2 specifically because they render the same result or results with unobvious difference. For example, I was extremely confused with the stretch example: like, what's the difference between 4x^2 and (2x)^2, for example? Or the example of -x^3 and (-x)^3 was confusing, because you are, like, looking at it and wondering: ain't it the same thing (another example function where the distinction between the transformations would actually render the same result would've been great). Also, from your explanation of shifting along the x-axis, it wasn't clear at all how that would work with other functions (that's where the sqrt(x) example would be perfect).

That is, x plus a positive number. The same way, x - 2 generates a shift to the right. That is, x plus a negative number (or minus a positive number).  You can express that as x + h where if h is positive, it shifts to the left and if h is negative, it shifts to the right. In the example, h is 2.  But it is easier to remember if h being positive generates a shift to the right. For that, we can flip the sign of h (x - h). This means if we plug a positive number in h, let's say 3, it gives x - 3 and so the shift is to the right. Notice that the sign is not part of h. For a negative value, - 3, it gives x - (-3) = x + 3 and so it is a shift to the left.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "MkP1LJR2PyM", "cid": "Ugz2NPpZE1jwLJJkYfd4AaABAg.9gg3fVLhNss9iVVOrRHkJb", "comment": "\u00a0@ArthasFB\u00a0 Wow!
