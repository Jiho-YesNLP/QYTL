Instead of checking the understanding of chemistry, they check how good are you at picking nasty word tricks in questions. This has nothing to do with chemistry or physics. There are worse things in these lectures than just tricky questions though. They are full of misconceptions and straight out incorrect information stated as facts. There are numbers and tables used without proper citations. There are sloppy experiments that either do not demonstrate the phenomenon in question, or straight out demonstrate a completely different phenomenon from the one stated. The history bits presented are historically wrong. Famous scientists are being ridiculed or misquoted, and words are being put in their mouths that they never said or stated. There are tricks in calculations too that distort the view of the students about the results of the experiments (like, rounding a number in one place so that the result, after multiplying by 6, turned out to precisely match the experimental data, while in reality it should be not much closer to it than the previous calculations in which she used a non-rounded number).
