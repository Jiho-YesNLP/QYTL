At time 4:47: I am sorry, but the way you wrote Bernoulli's Principle is incorrect. Correctly stated it says that as the speed changes (acceleration) along the flow (from one place to another due to diameter changes) the pressure changes (inversely). .. The way you stated it, pushing some fluid through a constant diameter pipe at a faster speed at a later time, means the pressure will be lower and this is simply untrue.  With no viscosity the internal pressure depends only on the system pressure and that can be anything and the velocity can also be anything. ... Also, Bernoulli did not develop that equation.  He only realized the inverse relationship between velocity and static pressure long a uniform flow. He defined no values, just that there was a pressure change accompanying a velocity change (acceleration) with absolutely no statement about cause and effect. ... It was Euler that realized the fact that it is the pressure gradient that is the accelerating force in fluids.  Pressure gradient is the cause of acceleration pushing fluid from higher pressure to lower pressure regions..

The comparing with water from a much smaller barrol with a tube out from the bottom really confuses me! This is an comparing on the edge, but you can allso visualize a decrese in pipe diameter along the way from the water reservoirs, and the flow will still be the same as in the \"thick\" pipe.

The parameter which defines weather the flow is laminar or turbulent is named the Reynolds number. This parameter can be translated as the ration between inertial and viscous forces and, even though it is still difficult to identify/model the transition between flow regimes, it is known that higher Reynolds number correspond to turbulent flows and lower ones to laminar flows.  If we then \"decrease\" a fluid viscosity, the Reynolds number will increase , making the flow a turbulent one. The limit would be when viscosity is, like you assumed, zero. In this case the Reynolds number should be infinite, and one would incorrectly conclude that the flow is turbulent!  In fact, when viscosity is zero the flow is in fact called a potential flow (some more characteristics would be required but these ones do not go against any of your explanation). This kind of flow is described by the Laplace equation and not the usual Navier-Stokes equation.  Hope you don't take this correction the wrong way, but I've been working in fluid mechanics for a while and the topic of viscosity and flow regime is often confusing to someone learning it for the first time.

Imagine a single dot representing a molecule of some sort of gas. And Imagine it leaves a red trail wherever it goes. If i were to release him at the start of a 10 meter pipe with no initial velocity, you'll see the red line darting randomly in all directions, changing direction whenever it hits the wall. You will be able to notice that the line changed direction many times before finding its way out of the pipe. Now, let us shoot a gas molecule from the start of the pipe in a straight line in the direction of the end of the pipe. The molecule will still hit the walls a couple of times, and if you'd actually count the contact points of the red line, he will averagely almost hit the walls the same amount of times per second as the first experiment. But, because he moves down the pipe faster, he stays in one place far less, and he hits the wall far fewer times because he just rushes out of the pipe before even getting the chance to bounce around. Which means each molecule will spread their force to a wider area, while that force is staying not affected by the initial velocity we gave it (as it is perpendicular to the pipe in all directions). Pressure is a mesurement of how much force the molecules exert on their sorrounding when they interact. In a pipe the behavior of the pressure is unintuitive because you push the molecules to the only direction they won't feel much resistance, and cause them to interact less with the pipe (perpendicular velocity).

As a young undergraduate physics student, you learn a few things about this subject that blow your mind (really, you're not quite the same after you learn this).  First off, you learn some rather advanced methods of solving equations.  And you learn that you can create equations that describe systems that are so complicated, that you cannot solve the equation with a pencil and paper by hand --- without making significant simplifications, mathematical analogies, really -- the most clever physicists are really good at making these mathematical analogies; Richard Feynman, for instance, was one of these people, before he died of cancer in 1988.  One of these equations is a little thing called the Schroedinger Wave equation.  The Schroedinger Wave equation can be used (read:  is used) to describe the behavior of the electro-dynamic cloud that surrounds the nucleus of any atom.  There is only one instance in which, the Schroedinger Wave equation can be solved by hand (read: without the use of computers); and that is for the Hydrogen atom.  The reason for this is simple, the hydrogen atom is simple --- it has 1 proton, and 1 electron (which is not a particle, actually, it's more of a wibbly-wobbly fluid-wave-like thing --- which 'Wave Equations' are really good at describing).  The first, most important lesson regarding why we care about doing this is because we can use the solutions to these equations to describe the way that light will interact with the electron cloud surrounding the atoms.  Hydrogen absorbs and reflects light at different wavelengths (it reacts differently with differently 'colored' light  -- ie, hydrogen will absorb red light differently from how it absorbs blue light).  Being able to predict and describe this kind of thing allows a person to construct or put together different types of materials to create things like, new types of lasers, design new materials to be used in LEDs (and thereby light their bedroom, on a 6 Watt LED rather than with a 60 Watt traditional lightbulb, thereby using 10x less energy to light their house).  It also gives you a schematic and a guide to tell you how a material will react if you bombard it with energy in different ways.  (Like what happens if you physically 'hit' it with something; what happens if you heat it a certain way)  Things like this.  As for relativity:  Talk to someone else.  I admit that I find Quantum Mechanics more interesting than Relativity (but it's only because we can actually do more with Quantum Mechanics right now than General Relativity -- as far as I know, chalk this sentiment up to a hole in my personal education  -- if the combination of the two led to an advancement like anti-gravity some 200 years into the future; I would have to roll over in my grave, smile, then eat my socks).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "fJefjG3xhW0", "cid": "UggAhL3dPuHRw3gCoAEC.8GKVRk98PTI8GKaRBM7jCf", "comment": "The theorem only applies in the idealized case where the diameter of the barrel is infinitely larger than the pipe, so that we can cancel the (1/2)*\\rho*v^2_{top} term.
