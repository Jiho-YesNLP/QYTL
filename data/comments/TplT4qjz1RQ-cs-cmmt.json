But I think most people will do it just like you described, since at first glance it doesn't make sense to implement the view before you have something to display, right? The problem is though, that modelling the data (correctly) can be the hard part if you are making a complex application. And when the data is not modelled correctly structurally, you'll notice that when building the view around it that something is not right - so you go back to the model, change stuff, maybe scrap some ideas entirely, and then go back to the view and change that also... Then the circle continues and you'll go back and forth. On the other hand - if you start with the view (you could use static hard-coded data), you are working more directly on the end result and when that looks fine, you can model the backend according to what it actually needs to do, and nothing more.", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TplT4qjz1RQ", "cid": "UgxaCrCPfI9pSwK7P6Z4AaABAg.8r8uSVGx6EA8rWF8v3WfQs", "comment": "Thanks dasten123  This comment was helpful", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "TplT4qjz1RQ", "cid": "UgyckuLT4l-eIY5qXI94AaABAg.8r5otXTkxJn8rnI0oqyTuU", "comment": "You don't need a CS degree.
