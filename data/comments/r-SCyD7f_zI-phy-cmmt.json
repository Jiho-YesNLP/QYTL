Let us answer this question with a question. When a circular belt is passing over two pulleys, why are two belts needed? The answer: THERE ARE NOT TWO BELTS! There is only one belt, and the belt is circular. It looks like there are two belts, with one of them flowing leftwards and the other one flowing right. But in truth, there is just one belt, and it is rotating. So, why are two wires needed? The answer: THERE ARE NOT TWO WIRES! Instead there is only one wire, but it is connected in a circle. All metals are full of movable electrons, so when we connect a wire in a circle, we are forming a kind of \u201celectric drive-belt\u201d, which can move inside the wire.   Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two. To learn the operation of circuits and the way they transfer energy, it is instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level as in the following two videos: i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and  ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   Electric currents in copper wires are a flow of electrons, but these electrons are not supplied by batteries.  The millions of electrons in a circuit were already there before the battery was connected. They (millions of electrons) were even there before the copper was mined and made into wires!  We cover copper wires with plastic and colour the plastic; the electrons are not coloured! Also see, http://amasci.com/miscon/eleca.html#batt2 It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the energy transfers in simple circuits.
