However, I think the assumption that \"history shows we've dealt with this fine\" is extremely flawed. We have almost no history to base this on. Technology only started dramatically moving people away from mostly farming a few centuries ago. Technology freed us from needing to use our bodies to being able to use our minds- humans weren't obsolete because we continued to, in mass quantities, still have something to contribute with our minds. However as more jobs are automated, the need for physical labor continues to decline, as does mental labor. The space for humans to give more shrinks. This also doesn't address the fact that as the automation increases in speed, that quick little \"short term economic problem\" will be far more disruptive. 20%+ Unemployment in the U.S. Depression was country-crippling; we don't just need to start worrying when we start eliminating 60% of jobs  as mentioned. If we haven't fundamentally shifted in a completely unknowable (or at the least, exceptional by modern standards) way very soon, we're going to see those effects firsthand.   As mentioned in CGP Grey's Humans Need Not Apply,  horses didn't find new jobs because the Model-T \"freed them up to do other things\". Horses become un-employable because they had nothing left to give the economy.

That's not immortality.  From my perspective I will still die eventually and my consciousness will end.  I don't get to magically switch to the one that is in the computer.
