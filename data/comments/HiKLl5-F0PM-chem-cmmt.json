Remember an exponent in the denominator can be raised to the numerator by flipping the sign. So I always tell people, in the example you gave, divide the front numbers alone 7/2.8 = 2.5 then flip the exponent in the denominator which pushes it to the numerator (10^-4/10^-3) becomes (10^-4 \u00d7 10^3). Multiplying exponents means you add the exponents which now gives you 10^(-4+3) = 10^-1. Now combine it all..2.5 x 10^-1 or .25.
