Earth orbits not in a perfect circle shape but in a eliptical shape around the sun, so its distance to sun changes time to time. If earth is closer to sun, it will move faster, and the more earth is away from the sun, it will move slower due to gravitational force changing by distance's square. Since the Earth is not orbitting with a constant speed around the sun, therefore you cant use the d=vt constant speed equation. I understand that you are trying to prove it simply by accepting that earth orbits in a perfect circle shape around the sun and there is no problem with that BUT you should state the \"reality\" too. You are saying \"earth orbits around the sun with a consant speed\" like a fact.
