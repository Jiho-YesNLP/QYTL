I have questions 1.If a lattice  basis is not a single atom is the max packing fraction different?? Since for example in the Na Cl we have Na between the Cl! 2. When you see packing fractions in a certain plane do you calculate it in 2 d not in 3 d as the whole maximum packing? 3. Does the more maximum packing relate to higher bond strength since they break up in least packing region?
