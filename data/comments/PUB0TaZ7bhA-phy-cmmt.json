It covers finding missing sides, special triangles, and calculating trigonometric values using sine, cosine, and tangent.

SOHCAHTOA helps relate these sides to the six trigonometric functions sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent.           -SOHCAHTOA relates the sides of a right triangle to the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent.           -Special right triangles like 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, and 7-24-25 have whole number ratios that simplify calculations. 05:05 By understanding SOHCAHTOA, one can easily calculate the values of sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent in right triangles.           -Using the 8-15-17 triangle to find the missing side and trigonometric values.           -Applying the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the missing side in a 3-4-5 triangle. 10:09 Trigonometric functions like tangent, cosine, and sine can be used to find missing side lengths in right triangles by relating sides to angles.           -Using tangent to find a missing side length by dividing opposite over adjacent sides.           -Applying cosine to determine a side length by dividing adjacent over hypotenuse.           -Utilizing sine function to calculate a side length by dividing opposite over hypotenuse. 15:13 To find missing angles in right triangles, use trigonometric functions like tangent, cosine, and sine. Calculate these angles using inverse trigonometric functions.           -Using tangent to find missing angles in right triangles.           -Applying cosine to calculate angles in right triangles.           -Utilizing sine function to determine missing angles in right triangles.", "votes": "1", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "PUB0TaZ7bhA", "cid": "Ugws2kLRJE0XeDTrDnt4AaABAg.A2UO7Ufs7GlA5L_gYwIbRz", "comment": "Skill issue", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PUB0TaZ7bhA", "cid": "Ugwz2xY4Wv_hzbm1uPp4AaABAg.A2JSt-GlPC2A87qR_0Q7OE", "comment": "the first one he used tangent because the angle theta is adjacent you can already see that the adjacent side of the theta is 4 at the opposite side is 5 he used tan because the tangent is opposite over adjacent, as those are the only two sides given, and in the second he only gave adj and hyp, he used cos  because cos is adj over hyp", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PUB0TaZ7bhA", "cid": "UgwyMbz-Dd6T4S7DrqF4AaABAg.A2CRUyZE1tjA2CRwUjjxS0", "comment": ".", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "PUB0TaZ7bhA", "cid": "Ugxh2BGo-Ynye6pyH114AaABAg", "comment": "You know what's sad is that the LAUSD school system could never teach this when I was growing up this doesn't require having a ultra high IQ it's just memorization and practicing like sport.

Many people seem to connect with your style of teaching, so I hope people will be able to learn from your content for many years, and that you continue to expand the number of your lessons available to people who have a desire to learn. I need to help my girlfriend's daughter with understanding trigonometry, and with her being should over the internet, the lectures are not as easily comprehensible for her. So, I just needed a rudimentary refresher course on the fundamentals instead of attempting to rely merely on my memory. Judging from the comments, and what I've viewed during the first ten minutes of this video, I could easily make the assessment I did regarding your natural teaching style. Your lessons appear to be concise, providing only what is sufficient for learning while avoiding superfluous information which typically only convolutes the subject.... not too hot, not too cold. Being about halfway through this video, I did notice a slight error, a simple misspoken piece of information which you might care to correct just to avoid that relatively small number of people who might become slightly confused in not realizing that you just had a slip of the tongue. At around 9:40, you accidentally state that the length of the hypotenuse is 27 rather than its actual value, being 25.
