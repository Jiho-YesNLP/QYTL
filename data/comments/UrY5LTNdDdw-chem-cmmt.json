Many of the videos on Youtube didn't deal with the possibilities such as NO3-, SO42-,,, etc and your video helped me understand the structure REALLY REALLY BETTER. I think I will be getting a lot more help in studying chemistry in the future. THANK YOU SO MUCH!  P.S. Your pronunciation makes your lectures so much easier to understand (since I've never been to US or coutries that use English,, so I' ve never been able to hear pronunciations except standard English ... thus making it harder for me to watch various videos). Thank you!  Oh! And by the way, if it is possible, could you please upload a video about quantum mechanics? (Not in a very detailed level, but in a level that can roughly help understand quantum mechanics.) I'm not criticizing the professors' lectures-they have profound knowledge and so on-but those lecutres were too difficult for me to understand...

Thank you thank you thank you!!! So often, tutorials online leave students (like myself) questioning about other possibilities because they only show 1 or 2 or 3 (if you're lucky) of the 9 or so possibilities that you covered. Always worrying if there is some exception, or if there is some special type missing from the video is super nerve-wracking and anxiety-producing. My Gen Chem prof frequently put exceptions on the exams and everyone was stumped.
