When we apply heat the bonds in CaCO3 are broken and the most stable products will be formed in order for this to be a favorable reaction. CO32- has a net negative charge without the Ca2+. Charged compounds such as Ca(2+) and CO3(2-) are unstable 'on their own' so would not be favorable products of decomposition. However, CO2 is a stable oxide of carbon (it is also more stable than carbon monoxide, CO which would be another possibility) which we know because it is so prevelant in the atmosphere. Calcium Oxide is also more stable than forming Ca2+ ions on their own. So the best combination of the products is CaO and CO2.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "g4bvNDyIkLU", "cid": "Ugy30o4X6w--yiJrdaV4AaABAg.A-Yrs8oJW6EA-ZUByiGkeD", "comment": "For your second question that is an (l) in the parenthesis next to H2O, not a gamma sign :)", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "g4bvNDyIkLU", "cid": "Ugy30o4X6w--yiJrdaV4AaABAg.A-Yrs8oJW6EA-_JFGUYWdT", "comment": "\u00a0@ChadsPrep\u00a0 oh i see, well now i understand, so i believe what you\u2019re saying is no matter what compound there is and whatever reaction is been applied, the product has to be stable yes?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "g4bvNDyIkLU", "cid": "Ugy30o4X6w--yiJrdaV4AaABAg.A-Yrs8oJW6EA-_JuMxxi0r", "comment": "\u00a0@ChadsPrep\u00a0 i wish i could show a screenshot of it sir, it sure looked like a gamma sign to me\ud83d\ude05glad it\u2019s not cos i was so lost", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "g4bvNDyIkLU", "cid": "Ugy30o4X6w--yiJrdaV4AaABAg.A-Yrs8oJW6EA-adoc36uno", "comment": "Regarding the 'l' I get what you are saying but it is very common for the 'l' as a state symbol to be written in cursive in this way so just for future awareness in your lectures/studies. Regarding the thermal decomposition, if energy is required for a reaction to occur then the products (going back to endothermic reactions) are higher in energy than the reactants which is why the reaction needs the energy input to  occur. Where there are mulltiple reaction pathways possible  there may be a mixture of products where the most stable/easily formed (thermodynamic or kinetic products) are the major products and anything else is a minor product. However, in some cases the other options for example carbon monoxide or somehow separating Ca(2+) and CO3(2-) without any other compound present are so unfavorable that they wouldn't occur at all. In this reaction, it requires energy input and the only possible products by this mechanism are CaO and CO2.
