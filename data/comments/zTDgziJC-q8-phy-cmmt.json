Thevenin Equivalent looks at what voltage that resistor sees in front of it and the current across it. The voltage drop, in this case is 12, will change with any RL values since the VL=RL*iL and we calculated iL using the thevenin equvalent of the circuit.   For example, if you plug in 1 ohm as RL, you will get these values: iL = 2.8197 A VA = iL * RL = 2.8197A * 1Ohm =  2.8197 V VC = 2.8197V + 2.8197A * 9Ohm = 28.197 V Current across 5 Ohm = 28.197V / 5ohm = 5.6394 A = i5 <--- this is just a random variable i chose Current across point C, iC = i5 + iL = 5.6394a + 2.8197A = 8.4591A Current across 4 Ohm, i4 = iC - 3 = 5.4591A = i4  <----- Again, another variable to denote the current across 4 ohm  Voltage drop at 4 ohm = 4Ohm * i4 = 4 * 5.4591 = 21.8364 V = V4 <----- variable for voltage drop across 4 ohm And in the end, going back to the power source, VC + V4 = 50.0V <---- 50V at the source which is always a good way to check if youre doing your calculation correctly.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwh0fD8g9JVJ_816Bd4AaABAg.91YxMPIWaY694M_NAKKSkR", "comment": "\u00a0@zodcx\u00a0 ah ok.

You say the RL can literally be anything but what if we just use 1000 ohms? then the problem wouldn't make any sense meaning you can't just throw any RL in and expect the same results. thevanin resistance equivalent was found to be 11.2ohms.

You don't. You get a different Isc and Voc every time and that is what you use to find Isc = ILoad which is the current through the load resistor. The voltage drop in the load is VL and is calculated using RL and IL, obviously, is different from every load resistor. If you have R = 0, then your IL=Isc would be infinite as R=0 is technically a short. If R = infinity, then Isc is open and is equal to 0. Using Isc and RL, you can find the voltage drop across the load (6 ohms), which is 12V in this case.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwxy1NBbfdxjpruie54AaABAg.91WpJv3cJiT91WtiKjQxLj", "comment": "Correct", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwxy1NBbfdxjpruie54AaABAg.91WpJv3cJiT927dWv482Ks", "comment": "Same, saving my Circuits grade!", "votes": "13", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwxy1NBbfdxjpruie54AaABAg.91WpJv3cJiT9FwmvpZ7hTi", "comment": "Me too!", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwxy1NBbfdxjpruie54AaABAg.91WpJv3cJiT9MA_aYVtxm9", "comment": ".sjbr", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwxy1NBbfdxjpruie54AaABAg.91WpJv3cJiT9RnccKzrpK7", "comment": "https://youtu.be/p2GNgMG15mE", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugwxy1NBbfdxjpruie54AaABAg.91WpJv3cJiT9srXeeZVloo", "comment": "can you tell me why load R was 6 ohm?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugw1dtvBk5MCWtWMHel4AaABAg.91WlQCgzdy991XXql5bZRQ", "comment": "https://youtu.be/rBSuMooMYrs", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "Ugw1dtvBk5MCWtWMHel4AaABAg.91WlQCgzdy991XXw71aCwP", "comment": "Check out the link below that is what he uses to make videos.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zTDgziJC-q8", "cid": "UgwBnfCsAGEuoCzRrWd4AaABAg.91WkoRx0Xc099lgiavGrwk", "comment": "Wtfff who the fuck teaches this at school??
