Will they not revolt at being sent to fight wars that are not theirs? Now this is still science fiction, but at the rate technology has advanced especially in the last two decades we need to think about these things now. The movie \"Ex Machina\" as well as the great TV series BSG (the reimagined one) dealt with this issue in a very provocative and interesting way. No clear answers were given, but they did address the issue. What is sentience? At what point do we declare a machine self-aware? Will we grant these machines the same rights that we now call human rights? In the effort to create machines that can replace soldiers for example, we inevitably try to give those machines the same capabilities as a human. The ability to observe, judge, decide and act on that decision. The line between what we now consider uniquely human and robot/machine intelligence may get blurred. After all, we still don't fully understand how our brains operate and how the \"self\" is created. After all, everything psychological is ultimately biological. Our brains use chemical as well as electrical signals to communicate. So, I don't think the question is not whether or not we can create a self-aware machine, but when. Once machines are able to learn on their own and build their own neural networks in a way similar to an organic brain, they will most likely look for models similar to a child.
