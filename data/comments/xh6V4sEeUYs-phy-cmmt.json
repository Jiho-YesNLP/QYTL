The mass of air that is shown is 1.29kg / cubic meter. . . this did not seem right to me at all, compared to numbers I've used for scuba diving. So I did a quick check to find out what the mass of air was at sea level. Sure enough, it showed 1.29 kg, only that was 1.29 kg per liter, not cubic meter. Also, this would assume you are flying the balloon in freezing temperatures at sea level.  I'm not going to go through the several other problems I've seen so far . . . and I'm also not going to watch 5 times longer to get to the end & make an exhaustive comparison of this \"math\" from reality.  Here's why I stopped, I know roughly how bit a 2 liter of soda is, so I imagine cutting it in 1/2 . . . I also know a cubic meter is roughly 3 feet wide by 3 feet tall by 3 feet deep (more specifically 1 meter X 1 meter X 1 meter).

Perhaps you've seen Magrittes monolith (maybe search on youtube, it's a huge 'block' that levitates and rotates with helium) The way it works, is it has a light material and is filled with helium in different parts of its body. It also has nozzles on each side to push it around -> makes it move in the room. It rotates with helium being pushed inside the block to different ends. So if you want it to tip on its side, yoy make the helium inside it go to the corner you want facing up, get it?  It's quite cool, and with the right calculations, you could make a simple one yourself: Fill a light box, that holds gasses, with helium so that it levitates at a certain air pressure. For example on shoulder height. The problem with it not having nozzles outside, is that it can easily rise, because it cannot resist the upward force.  Still pretty neat, I'm turning just 18 in a couple months but when I have kids someday, I'll definitely show them some Star Wars Jedi stuff with a levitating box like that ;)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "xh6V4sEeUYs", "cid": "UgxE5QOnAeQSzYKCf3F4AaABAg.8jUhFvwdxpd8r0zYl2do7m", "comment": "you are correct and you have to minus the weight of the  helium and Ignore the 9.8", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "xh6V4sEeUYs", "cid": "UgzLsfW0k5oOQgfyvUh4AaABAg.8_A2O281uwZ8k1HUa4Stxn", "comment": "Great lesson on designing my junior model airship.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
