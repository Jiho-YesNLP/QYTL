And while the inductor blocks AC , its not of any use (although i am pretty sure they are used in home appliances but i dont know how they could be used with AC in homes)  But the thing is the use of inductors , as we 12th graders should know is through DC it is allowed and no opposite emf is generated  FOR DETAILS\u2014 see the formula .... XL= L \u03c9 \u03c9 is the frequency at which the AC current is sent through the circuit.  And ONLY AC CURRENT has a frequency. DC does not have a frequency and so is constant.   You can figure out from this that Reactance is Huge in AC and so it is blocked and and so emf produced is equal to emf applied. (I think you got your answer)  While DC has zero frequency and so Reactance is zero and so current flows freely Reactance is kind of a Resistance.

And that is where the DC becomes constant. And after that, current flows through inductor.  It also makes sense as the phase shift is seen in sine of theta.  Theta keeps changing in ac.

The use of calculus and differential equations to solve the more complex configurations is definitely required, and as a student you will have to learn how to do this type of calculation.
