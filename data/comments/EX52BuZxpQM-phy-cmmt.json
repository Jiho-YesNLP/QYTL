That is a series circuit just through those 3. He then figures out the total resistance between the 4 ohm resistor and the 12 and the 8 which will will call a 20 ohm resistor. The current can either go one direction at point a and go through the 4 ohm resistor, or the other direction to go in the 20 ohm. Since this is a parallel 1/R(total)=1/R1+1/R2\u2026.  Therefore 1/4+1/20= 5/20+1/20 or 6/20. 1/R(total)=6/20. R=20/6 or 10/3.
