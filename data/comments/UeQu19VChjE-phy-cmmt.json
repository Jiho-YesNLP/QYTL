I assume that the fluid, once already flowing, should continue to flow unless acted upon by an outside force (in this case internal friction), as stated in Newton's first law. However, in the real world, a fluid requires a pressure differential in order to continue to flow (as you stated).", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "UeQu19VChjE", "cid": "UgzCaSLJDzYdCCa_pBB4AaABAg.8gQrCRpnhqR95V5HLMJUMK", "comment": "You should know about Newton's first and second law.

However, ideal fluids are theoritical, in real life there is no such thing. So friction is present and therefore will cause the speed of the fluid to decrease but since in real life there is pressure difference, the pressure difference causes the real fluid to remain at constant speed.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "UeQu19VChjE", "cid": "UgzCaSLJDzYdCCa_pBB4AaABAg.8gQrCRpnhqR9FZC0c2cSQ-", "comment": "well maybe not constant speed but remain to flow*", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
