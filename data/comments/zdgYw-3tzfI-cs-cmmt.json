This is not true.  Since the list comprehension is wrapped within a pair of brackets [ ], you can break the line anywhere you prefer to facilitate enhanced readability; and the list comprehension will work perfectly fine. Although, a really long list-comprehension that requires one to break down into multiple lines, may not be desirable, as future maintenance of such code could elicit unnecessary confusion. One of the tenets of writing better code is also the how less cryptic it is for future maintenance. Also, request.args.get(\"q\") is getting called as many times as the number of words in WORDS variable. Perhaps a more resource-conserved approach will be this:  q = request.args.get(\"q\") words = [ word for word in WORDS if word.startswith(q) ]", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "UgwSdCYRJxV-4K9tFhF4AaABAg", "comment": "his energy... a f*cking chapel? \ud83d\ude02 I cant.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "UgwW5yAV9j1zwcNff7t4AaABAg", "comment": "can some one ask him to stop jumping?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "Ugx3seJ03HadeeGXV-14AaABAg.8qgf-WbhkbC8qgfOJoZOPg", "comment": "Thank you very much\u263a\u263a", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "Ugx3seJ03HadeeGXV-14AaABAg.8qgf-WbhkbC9z3mbBgt3-l", "comment": "0:49", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "Ugx3seJ03HadeeGXV-14AaABAg.8qgf-WbhkbC9z3mj0Yv64o", "comment": "http://www.google.com/viewer/content/eak5vu7b/CFvWEG", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "UgxFXb91umKgFyGFUqR4AaABAg", "comment": "Not trying to be the \u2018smartguy\u2019 but why would the person blur the whole url to hide it probably for security reasons at 16:00 and dont hide it from the tv behind the teacher at 16:00 for example?", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "zdgYw-3tzfI", "cid": "Ugxt6M6b4-ilf_Ygybp4AaABAg", "comment": "If you guys are looking for a HDR version.
