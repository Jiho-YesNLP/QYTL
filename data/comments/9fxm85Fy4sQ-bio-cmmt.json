The first recommendation physicians give is to intake more fluids and sodium to increase blood volume, which in turn--sometimes--increases blood pressure. This is important because in POTS we don't have the reflects around our veins to push blood back up to our hearts, so blood constantly drains down (fun stuff). So when I heard this segment I thought, \"Screwy biology! Veins need higher pressure!\" in regard to my particular condition. Sure, the circulatory system needs the pressure differences between arteries and veins, but it also sounds odd in a sense because at least arteries get to where they need to go because of gravity.
