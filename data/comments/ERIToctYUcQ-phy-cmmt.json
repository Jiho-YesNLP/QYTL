It has peaks and valleys.   In essence, the sinewave is a perfect embodiment of oscillatory movements like springs and quantities like voltage. It retains its waveshape when added to another sinewave of the same frequency and arbitrary phase and is the only periodic waveform which has this property.   The charges in a resistor subject to a sinusoidal voltage do not migrate elsewhere on the average. They merely slosh back and forth, so to say, over each cycle without a change in their position when the resistor was not energised.   Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two.

The negative half-cycle now commences, when the generator operates by separating charges in the opposite direction initially rapidly and slowing down and momentarily halting when its voltage is at the negative peak, and then gradually reuniting the charges to make their separation zero; when all charges reunite, the generator voltage is zero. It then begins the next positive half-cycle followed by the negative half-cycle and the process repeats.

The polarity reversals of an applied sinusoidal voltage (with the direction reversals of the applied electric field) do not affect electron collisions with the lattice ions. Electrons colliding with lattice ions from either direction will continue to produce heat and there is no cancellation of the heat developed! Mathematically, the average value of a sinusoid is zero, and so, the average value of the current will also be zero. The average values cannot therefore represent the heat developed in a resistor with a sinusoidal current.   A resistor cannot develop heat due to a current in one half-cycle and then cool itself by a like amount of heat during the next half-cycle! It develops heat either way whether the current is positive or negative. The lattice ions vibrate from collisions irrespective of the directions in which the electrons collide with them. Therefore, since the average value is zero, it necessitates the use of the root-mean-square values of the voltage and current to compute the power, which is a statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity and is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the square of the sinusoidal function.
