This Analysis consists in making Experiments and Observations, and in drawing general Conclusions from them by Induction, and admitting of no Objections against the Conclusions, but such as are taken from Experiments, or other certain Truths. For Hypotheses are not to be regarded in experimental Philosophy.\u201d - Isaac Newton  from wiki:  Until the late 19th or early 20th century, scientists were called \"natural philosophers\" or \"men of science\".  The Encyclopedia Britannica on inductive reasoning:  \"When a person uses a number of established facts to draw a general conclusion, he uses inductive reasoning. THIS IS THE KIND OF LOGIC NORMALLY USED IN THE SCIENCES. ...\"  \u201cHe who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God.\u201d - Isaac Newton  \"Later Philosophers banish the Consideration of such a Cause out of natural Philosophy, feigning Hypotheses for explaining all things mechanically, and referring other Causes to Metaphysicks: Whereas the main Business of natural Philosophy is to argue from Phaenomena without feigning Hypotheses, and to deduce Causes from Effects, till we come to the very first Cause, which certainly is not mechanical;... Whence is it that Nature doth nothing in vain; and whence arises all that Order and Beauty which we see in the World? ... And these things being rightly dispatch'd, does it not appear from phaenomena that there is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent, omnipresent, who in infinite space, as it were in his Sensory, sees the things themselves intimately, and thoroughly perceives them, and comprehends them wholly by their immediate presence to himself: Of which things the images only carried through the organs of sense into our little sensoriums are there seen and beheld by that which in us perceives and thinks. And though every true step made in this philosophy brings us not immediately to the knowledge of the first cause, yet it brings us nearer to it... were men and beast made by fortuitous jumblings of the atoms, there would be many parts useless in them. Here a lump of flesh, there a member too much. Some kinds of beasts might have had but one eye, some more than two. Atoms, mechanical laws, are nothing compared to the knowledge and wisdom of the Creator.\" - Isaac Newton  again bringing us back to:  \"And these things [eyes, organs, parts, biomolecular machines like enzymes] being rightly dispatch'd, does it not appear from phaenomena that there is a Being ..., living, intelligent...\"?

So many aspects of our anatomy, molecular biology and biochemistry is inefficient / unnecessarily complex or even useless as a design.\"  And yet here we are, a reproducing intelligent self-repairing and self-correcting \"survival machine\" (quoting Dawkins) capable of so much more than just what I mentioned in this sentence. Such as love and art, a wide range of emotions. I don't see you making a self-reproducing machine made up of smaller interacting nanoscale machines like that as efficient as that at these capabilities (try talking to some Japanese scientists building robots designed to imitate humans to see what some of the engineering difficulties are to overcome, especially regarding the intelligence part, but so much more). I think you have a poor judgement of good engineering, especially nanoscale engineering, perhaps if you watch the video called:  The Central Dogma synra edition  you'll get a different appreciation for it. Otherwise you could search youtube for the phrase:  so-called unintelligent design  To see where you might be arguing from ignorance regarding what you call \"inefficient / unnecessarily complex or even useless\". Which aren't even qualifiers for determining whether something is a machine and thus designed or not (a machine does not have to be perfectly efficient to still be able to tell that it is a machine, our machines aren't, they also often contain a certain amount of complexity that may not be understood by everyone why it is there or functions that way). Which in turn requires a designer or designers, a conclusion one can draw by inductive reasoning on what we know, established facts and the meaning of language. One can tell by observation of the functional arrangement of parts if something is designed or not and this is quantitative (the more parts, the more sophisticated and fitting their arrangement and the more functional their interactions, the easier it is to tell if one is looking at a machine or just an illusion/the appearance of a machine, check out the examples given by Behe in his presentation about this subject if you can find it, 'the Old Man in the Mountain' and 'Mount Rushmore'). The conclusions a person draws from this process is the method of scientific enquiry that Newton encouraged and it is superior than putting videos on youtube with just-so stories and maybe-so stories that don't work logically if you think a bit longer about them with a bit more skepticism and a bit less wishful thinking that natural causes can make machines come into existence and can arrange parts together in such a functional way that it produces a living reproducing organism. Those you described when you said:  \"there are videos even on YouTube which explain the possible evolutionary adaptions of such components which had prior functions before it became what it is today.\"  There is no evolution in the sense that these videos mean without reproduction. All of what I spoke of are minimum components required for reproduction that we know of, not imagining or hypothesizing some fantasy single-celled animal precursor to life that can't reproduce and doesn't have any ATP to run anything on. It works the way we are observing it now, all these other suggestions are hypotheses unless you can demonstrate it working and transitioning (evolving) from one machine into the other in a related chain of living organisms at least (over multiple generations, but how are you gonna start evolving without ATP? And the machines involved in the synthesis of ATP? Since that was the main subject that I was discussing. Plenty of stories about the bacterial flagellum on youtube that don't work but it doesn't seem people like talking about the ATP synthesis machine, the DNA Polymerase machine, the Ribosome machine, and way more to mention). And people really don't need to call them enzymes all the time to cover up the truth every layman can see once they actually look at how it functions in a good accurate animation.
