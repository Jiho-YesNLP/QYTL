Who is Gilbert Strang? - Gilbert Strang is a mathematician and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  2. What is the goal of Strang's teaching method? - The goal of Strang's teaching method is to help students think through problems, rather than simply presenting solutions. He believes that giving students time and encouraging them to think with him is crucial for their learning.  3. How does Strang use humor in his teaching? - Strang uses humor to make the learning experience more human and relatable. He believes that seeing mathematics as a natural and approachable subject can help students engage with it better.  4. How does Strang decide when to go into detail when teaching complex material? - Strang tries to think through the material and recognize the words and steps needed to convey it effectively. He also pays attention to the thinking of the class and adjusts his approach accordingly.  5. Does Strang ever encounter difficulties while demonstrating problems in real-time during lectures? - Yes, Strang sometimes gets stuck or loses the thread while working through problems in real-time. However, he sees this as an opportunity for students to see how to work through difficulties and find solutions, just as they will need to do in their own studies.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "7UJ4CFRGd-U", "cid": "UgxXOUK9EcDAsMD93eV4AaABAg", "comment": "Gilbert Strand is a name brand when it comes to linear Algebra and the teaching style which provokes common sense, inspection and creativity in the audience.

Sometimes, though, I wished he had an entire chapter in the course devoted to a variety of applications, at least for those specially various students who take the course for nagging urgent industry needs.
