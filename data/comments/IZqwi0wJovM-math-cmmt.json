The basic knowledge we need from calculus is $\\frac{d}{dt}$$e^{ax} = ae^{ax}$. Now we have two equations $$\\frac{du_1}{dt} = -u_1+2u_2$$ $$\\frac{du_1}{dt} = u_1-2u_2$$ I write these equations as $$\\begin{matrix} u_1'\\\\u_2' \\end{matrix} = \\biggl[\\begin{matrix} -1&2\\\\1&-2 \\end{matrix}\\biggr] \\begin{matrix}u_1\\\\u_2\\end{matrix}$$.\r \r In matrix form, $U' = AU$. Now if I take $e^{\\lambda t}k$ where 'k' is a vector as a solution, I get $\\lambda e^{\\lambda t}k = Ae^{\\lambda t}k $, which is $Ak = \\lambda k$. Hence lambda gives the power of the exponential in the solution which multiplies an eigenvector k. \r \r Part two (after minute 29): We already know that a complete set of eigenvectors will form a basis. So we can use eigenvector matrix to write any column vector. Then $u=Sv$; $\\frac{du}{dt} = S\\frac{dv}{dt} = ASv$, and $u(0) = Sv(0)$\r \r Again from calculus, the solution of $\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax$ is $x(t) = ae^{at}x(0)$. Now lets write this equation with a matrix $\\Lambda$. For a vector 'v', $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\Lambda v$, the solution is $v(t) =  e^{\\Lambda t}v(0)$. For 'u', we just substitue the values, we get $$ u(t) = Sv(t) = S e^{\\Lambda t} S^{-1}u(0) $$\r \r We started from $U'=AU$. Now we know that if $U = e^{At}$ then it solves the equation. Hence, $e^{At}=S\\Lambda e^{\\Lambda t} S^{-1}$.\r \r We also know that $e^x = 1+x+x^2/2+x^3/(3!)+....$. Now, let's replace 1 with $I$ and x with $At$ $$e^{At} = I+At+(At)^2/2+(At)^3/(3!)+....$$\r \r Here (minute 40), I will slightly deviate from lecture here: \r $$e^{\\Lambda t} = I+\\Lambda t+(\\Lambda t)^2/2+(\\Lambda t)^3/(3!)+....$$\r \r Substituting this in the equation for u(t), \r $$ u(t) = Sv(t) = S (I+\\Lambda t+(\\Lambda t)^2/2+(\\Lambda t)^3/(3!)+....) S^{-1}u(0) $$\r $$ u(t) = (I+S \\Lambda S^{-1}t+S(\\Lambda t)^2S^{-1}/2+S(\\Lambda t)^3S^{-1}/(3!)S^{-1}+....) u(0) $$\r \r Since $u(t) = e^{At}u(0)$, and A is $S^{-1}\\Lambda S$, we have\r $$e^{At} = I+At+(At)^2/2+(At)^3/(3!)+....$$\r \r As before :)\r \r Remember : A is diagonalizeable  (Edited based on the suggestion of Tony Jiang below)", "votes": "6", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "IZqwi0wJovM", "cid": "Ugyzg4L6SPg9SBOUAgh4AaABAg", "comment": "Prof. Strang is amazing but you should skip this lecture if you are NOT familiar with differential equations.

Here's what he's doing. He's decomposing \"u\" into a linear combination of the eigenvectors, which are arranged in the matrix \"S\". The elements of the vector \"v\" are the weights in that linear combination. He performed that \"trick\" so he could get rid of \"A\" (in which the variables of the system are coupled together), and replace it with capital Lambda, which is a diagonal matrix (uncoupled variables). The fact that capital Lambda is diagonal is important because the exponential of a diagonal matrix turns out to be trivial. So he's setting up an identity that relates the exponential of a non-diagonal matrix to the exponential of a diagonal one (multiplied as needed by the eigenvector matrix and its inverse). This is the foundation for the series-based definition of matrix exponentials he presents a little later in the lecture.
