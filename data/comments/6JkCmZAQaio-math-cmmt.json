Like many people look at math and go \"what will we need this for\", not seeing that even the most basic implementations of software engineering, chemistry or mechatronics engineering functionally requires at least some conception of basic algebra , let alone trig, Set theory and Booleans, and differential/integral calculus. And such things can help you get ahead in finance, personal health and safety, and just general problem solving and avoidance.  For things such as history, literature, geography, and art, I'd argue their benefits are generally considerably less general, but I definitely still think they should be taught, especially history and literature. I'd just say they're not as deserving of educational primacy as many STEM concepts. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  Oh wait this was supposed to a reply to the main comment. \ud83d\ude05 Well, moving on. It's more just that your average math curriculum is watered down, partly to cater to and uplift the lowest common denominator, mostly because of genuine pedagogical ineptitude of U.S math education. The concept of proofs isn't introduced in most corners until highschool and by then it's just barely anything, set theory and logical statements are after-thoughts, and arithmetic and algebraic proficiency is often left undercooked. TL;DR There are valid reasons as to why you \"spare\" children integrals and conic sections and such... but those valid reasons aren't often why U.S math education is watered down and the reasons it is isn't likely very good.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "6JkCmZAQaio", "cid": "Ugy005kLh9bhRnOqXSV4AaABAg.997Kh5LrNRsA7S_mBvhMMW", "comment": "\u00a0@ivoryas1696\u00a0 Agree.
