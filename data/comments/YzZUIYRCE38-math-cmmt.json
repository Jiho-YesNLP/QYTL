Thus, the a^2 in the Pythagorean formula corresponds to ||\u2192a||^2, where \u2192a just indicates vector a. This logic applies to the rest of the theorem, resulting you in   ||\u2192a||^2 + ||\u2192b||^2 = ||\u2192c||^2  But we know that \u2192c is just \u2192a + \u2192b, so we can replace that c with the vector sum, therefore  ||\u2192a||^2 + ||\u2192b||^2 = ||\u2192a + \u2192b||^2  That covers the vector interpretation of the Pythagoras Theorem.   As to why ||\u2192x||^2 can be written as x^T * x.

You would have the equation:  a1*3 +  a2* 5 =  b  If you could measure those two parameters absolutely precisely, you would always end up with the correct b. And the other way around - if you could measure b with absolute precision... but let's see what happens.  Suppose, you want to discover that natural law, i.e. you didn't know factors 3 and 5 but want to discover them.  You would measure the observable, b, in situations when you change a1 and a2 by experiment (or when you measure cases where a1 and a2 are naturally different from case to case). Suppose the ideal world (which doesn't exist) where there is no error in measurement.  You get, for example:  1*x1 + 1*x2 = 8 2*x1 + 1*x2 = 11 -1*x1 + 1*x2 = 2 1*x -0.2*x2 = 2   You have more than 2 equations, and two unknowns, x1, and x2. Because all the equations are linear combinations of just two of them, you can take any two equations, and throw away the rest and the solution will be: x1 = 3, x2 = 5.  If you put the coefficients in front of x1 in the first column of matrix A and those in front of x2 in the second column, then you 'get 4 x 2 matrix A: -           - | 1     1 | | 2     1 | | -1    1 | | 1 -0.2 | -           -  You could write x1 and x2 in a column, as a vector x with x1 and x2 as its coordinates: -      - | x1 | | x2 | -     -   You also write all the right-hand side numbers as coordinates of the vector b: -     - | 8  | | 11| | 2  | | 2  | -     - Then you can write all the above equations in a matrix form, as:  Ax = b.  Matrix A has the rank of 2 (only two independent equations - the other two, in this example, are just derived from them as linear combinations, so they don't provide any new information). You can replace A with the matrix A^, which is 2x2 matrix with only any two of the equations. (You also have to reduce your observed  b vector to 2-dimensional space, and write it as b^.) For example, you could choose equations:  -           -      -      -        -     - | 2     1 |  *  | x1 |   =   | 11| | -1    1 |      | x2 |        | 2  | -           -      -      -        -     - When you solve this system, and we can write it in a matrix form, as:  A^ * x = b^    for x, you get vector x with the coordinates x1 and x 2 that are 3 and 5, which is the solution you wanted.  But the world is not ideal. You do the measurements and you actually get the whole A as this one:  1,01*x1 + 0,99*x2 = 8,04 2, 01*x1 + 1,04* 2 = 10,99 -0,97*x1 + 1*x2 = 2,05 1*x -0.22*x2 = 2, 01  It's close to the first set of equations, but not exactly the same.  Now, you can solve the system of any two of these equations, but you cannot solve the whole system, because there doesn't exist a combination of x1 and x2 that satisfies all four equations. We say that the vector with coordinates: 8,04, 10,99, 2,05, 2,01, i.e. our observed 'b', is NOT in the column space of A. In the first example, which is extremely rare, vector b was, by chance, in the A's column space.

Let A be a m-by-n real number matrix.  And then, for any input vector x in R^n\r   Ax=0\u3000\u21d2  ((A*)A)x = (A*)(Ax) =0,\r so that if x is in the nullspace of A, then it is also in the nullspace of (A*)A, that is,   N((A*)A)\u2287N(A) ...(1).\r \r On the other hand, let   a[1], ..., a[n]  be the column vectors of A.   In other words, let   a*[1], ..., a*[n] \r be the row vectors of A*.   And then, for any input vector x in R^n, for each of i=1, ..., n, the i-th component of the product vector   ((A*)A)x=(A*)(Ax)\r is the dot product a*[i](Ax).   Therefore, ((A*)A)x=0 implies that for each of i=1, ..., n\r   a*[i](Ax)=0,\r so that Ax is perpendicular to any linear combination of the column vectors a[1], ..., a[n], i.e., to every vector in the column space C(A) of A.   However, as a linear combination of column vectors   a[1], ..., a[n], Ax is also in the column space C(A), which combined with the previous statement means that Ax is in C(A) and at the same time orthogonal to C(A).  This is possible if and only if Ax=0, because otherwise Ax is not perpendicular to itself (see note at the bottom for another reason).     Thus, after all it has been found that, for any input vector x in R^n\r   ((A*)A)x=0 \u21d2 Ax=0, \r so that if x is in the nullspace of (A*)A, then it is also in the nullspace of A, that is,\r   N((A*)A)\u2286N(A) ...(2).\r \r (1) and (2) combined, implication is that N((A*)A)=N(A).\u3000QED.\r ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  (Note):  If C(A) = {0}, then trivially Ax in C(A) is the zero vector.   Otherwise, by the so-called Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, an orthonormal basis can be chosen for the column space C(A) such that all the basis vectors are normalized and mutually orthogonal.  Then, the vector Ax in C(A) may be expressed as a linear combination of those basis vectors, namely   Ax = s[1]n[1]+ ... + s[r]n[r],\r where   n[1], ..., n[r] are the orthonormal basis vectors,    s[1], ..., s[r] are real numbers, and   r=rank(A).  However, since being orthogonal to C(A), Ax is perpendicular to each of the basis vectors.  Thus, for each of k=1, ..., r\r   0 = n*[k](Ax)\r     = n*[k](s[1]n[1] + ... + s[r]n[r])\r     = s[1](n*[k]n[1]) + ... + s[k](n*[k]n[k]) + ... + s[r](n*[k]n[r])\r     = s[k], \r implying that Ax = 0.

So, despite the fact that he\u2019s referring to rows of a matrix here, he\u2019s keeping up with his convention of referring to single vectors as column vectors only. So (row 1)^T x is a valid way to consider that multiplication since his convention would be to take that row on its own as a column vector with the same components.  Or you could simply say that he intended to consider row vectors to begin with and thus the use of (row 1)^T x is a mistake, since this is actually attempting to multiply two objects whose dimensions are such that the operation is not well defined.

So, there is NO solution. However, we may find an approximate solution (x_hat) if we just consider a component of b that is in the space spanned by the column vectors of A as the new b. A'b is getting the component of b that is in the space spanned by the column vectors of A. To see this, let b*=A'b, then each entry of b* is the inner product of b and a column vector of A, which is proportional to the length of the projection of b on the corresponding column vector of A. What we want to find for x_hat (the approximate solutions) are the length of b* along each direction of the column vector of A. This can be done by solving A'A(x_hat)=A'b. If A'A is invertible (that is, the column vectors of A are linearly independent), then x_hat = (A'A)^(-1)A'b.

Perpendicular is the familiar spatial concept of right angles.  Orthogonal means the dot product = 0, it's algebraic, not spatial.  Once we get past R3, I don't try to think spatially (e.g., 90\u00b0 angles in R4).  When you say the planes are perpendicular, you're thinking of a plane as pointing in one direction, but planes don't actually point in any direction.  A plane's normal vector points in a direction.   Saying two planes are perpendicular means their normal vectors are perpendicular.  Otherwise, to say two planes are perpendicular is meaningless, the way I see it.  I think Prof Strang only uses the term 'perpendicular' because we are already familiar with the pythagorean theorem and right triangles, to show that the pythagorean theorem also works with orthogonal vectors.  I'd just as soon forget the word 'perpendicular' as applied to linear alegreba.  The key point is that the familiar spatial relationships in R2 and R3 continue to work as algebraic relationships beyond R3.  E.g., I don't think of the 'length' of a vector in R4 because 'length' is a spatial concept; I think of the result of the pythagorean equation.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "YzZUIYRCE38", "cid": "UgxAy_mYeUwVEAuEOKx4AaABAg.8GcIyg_hHco9XmFjAd87Ie", "comment": "The normal vector to any plane (or hyperplane) is orthogonal to any vector in the plane.
