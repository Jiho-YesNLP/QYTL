First, modern color bandwidth is 24 bits (3 bytes, 1 for each of red, green, and blue, which creates the RGB and HEX colour systems). Second, disambiguating \"memory\" and \"storage\" is important in this context; in this video, \"memory\" refers to hard drives (commonly called \"storage\"), sold in gigabytes or terabytes, to which \"memory addresses\" do not apply. Finally, the Unicode UTF-8 standard deserves its own video (of which it has many) and can encode 1 character to as little as 1 byte (ASCII-compatible) upto 32 bits (or 4 bytes).", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1GSjbWt0c9M", "cid": "UgyRy3sHA-_rjAqtdmt4AaABAg", "comment": "\"Not everything is a positive value, like my bank account in college\"", "votes": "17", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1GSjbWt0c9M", "cid": "UgzcGq7Rhw7Gv4sL4OJ4AaABAg", "comment": "you are too good...thank u", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "1GSjbWt0c9M", "cid": "UgzhfsSh59V05aBjeah4AaABAg", "comment": "Hmmm, I thought it was nibbles, bits and bytes.

It is job of a program it self to keep on track what is what, that why in programming each variable need to have it's type declared, so code compiler know which CPU instructions use to it and how to make operations on it and it handles type control for you (in most cases it does not keep track of variable types at all, it simply sets CPU instructions in the way data is handled properly without need of knowing the type). If needed you yourself will need to keep track of that, for example if you got varable that can be both, you will need another variable which contains information what type of this variable is, so your program will know how to handle it.

Machine code and assembler code has instructions like \"move the number at this address to this address\", \"add this number to this other number\", \"if this number is bigger that other number, jump to this address\", \"move to the address x steps  away\", and the one that always seems pointless: \"do nothing\". It's all numbers that encode instructions. If the processor reaches a memory address containing a number that happens  to the same as the code for some instruction, it will interpret it as an instruction. That's why the instructions are like \"load the number x steps from here into temporary memory  (RAM)\" (usually load word, where 1 word = 4 bytes = 32 bits) or \"add the number x steps from here to the one currently stored in temporary memory\" or \"jump to the address stored x steps from here\".", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "1GSjbWt0c9M", "cid": "UggsKzZSwKLZVXgCoAEC.8Q8fUKlNLuh8QootvAxY6O", "comment": "It doesn't.

For one example, CPU cache lines are often defined as 4KB in size - that's 4096 bytes. That's useful because that represents 64 sets of 64 bytes, which can be nicely divided in to 512 64 bit numbers, or 1024 32 bit numbers, or 256 128 bit numbers - all common sizes programmers work with, and keeping it defined in powers of 2 keeps things nicely divisible. Software developers who keep track of their cache don't want to start referring to them as \"4 point oh nine six KB\" cache blocks, or purely in bytes (which would defeat the purpose anyway), and hardware developers don't want to change things because nobody wants to design a physical hardware bus with a bandwidth of 31-and-a-quarter 32 bit numbers just for the sake of being 24 closer to metric units.

The problem is that calling it \"kilobyte\" is just bad because \"kilo\" already means 1000 and now \"kilobyte\" can be interpreted in both ways. If it was called something else to begin with (Like \"kibibyte\" for example...) and \"kilobyte\" would never have meant 1024 bytes this problem would have been avoided.
