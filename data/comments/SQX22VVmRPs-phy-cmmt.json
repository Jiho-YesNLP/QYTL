The forces applied on the car to stop is the braking forces exerted in the backward direction.  The force that throws u in the forward direction after braking is your body\u2019s reaction.  Braking force is comparable to the inward pull it tension i the spinning string and if the string loses its strength the cutoff portion would feel the centrifugal force and would be thrown away radially out.  If a stone is attached to a spinning string or rope the stone would go tangentially out due to the tangential or instantaneous velocity.  Radially Inward acceleration always exists because the velocity is continuously changing. The radially inward leads to radially inward force which is newtons second law of motion.   Centrifugal force is the mass of the rock times the inward acceleration. It is a fictitious force.  The real force is centripetal force.
