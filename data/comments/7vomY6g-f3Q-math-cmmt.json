This answer is incomplete. Let's simplify \u221a243. I'll walk you through the steps and after that we'll evaluate where the original poster likely went wrong, alright? So, what do we know about \u221a243? Let's list it off: - We know it is the number, that, when multiplied by itself, makes 243. - 243 isn't a perfect square. We can tell, because numbers that end in 2, 3, 7 or 8 are never perfect squares. - \u221a243 can probably be simplified, because we don't like having big numbers under the \u221a symbol if we can help it. We want to make that number as small as possible and 243 is pretty big. Now... what can we divide 243 by to make it smaller? If we divide it by 1, we still have 243. We can't divide it by 2 because it's uneven. What about 3? 243/3 gives us 81. In other words, \u221a243 is the same as \u221a(3*81). Another way this can be written is \u221a3 * \u221a81. This makes sense because when you think about it, writing (3*81) means the same as writing 1*(3*81). When you write something between parentheses in math, there is an implied \"1 times\" in front of it. We just don't write it down because it's superfluous. But when you remember that it's there, you can easily solve for \u221a(3*81), because it becomes \u221a1(3*81). \u221a1*3 = \u221a3 and \u221a1*81 = \u221a81. So, \u221a(3*81) = \u221a3 * \u221a81. Can we simplify this? Yes, we can. 81 is on our times table. It is the product of 9 and 9. This makes it a perfect square. \u221a3*\u221a81 = \u221a3*9. We cannot simplify \u221a3 because it is a prime number, and we like to put our whole numbers in front of our radicals when we multiply them, so our final answer is 9\u221a3. It is not 3*3\u221a3, because we can solve for 3*3. ---------------------- So how did OP get 3\u221a27? Well, that's because the way we just did it isn't the only way to get the answer. What else can 243 be divided by? Not 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, but there's 9. 243/9 = 27. \"A-ha!\" the original poster probably thought, \"that makes \u221a(9 * 27), or \u221a9 * \u221a27, and 9 is a perfect square! \u221a9 * \u221a27 = 3*\u221a27, or 3\u221a27. I am done now.\" But they weren't done, because 27 is not the smallest number you can get under the \u221a symbol and that's what we want. What can we divide 27 by? 3 and 9, right? So, 3\u221a27 = 3\u221a(3*9). Remembering that implied \"1 times\" before parentheses, we solve: 3\u221a(3*9) = 3*\u221a1(3*9). That's 3*\u221a3*\u221a9. We know that 9 is a perfect square, so 3*\u221a3*\u221a9 = 3*\u221a3*3. PEMDAS says we can multiply these values in any order we want and get the same answer, meaning we can solve for 3*3 and get 9*\u221a3. We take away the multiplication symbol because it is unnecessary and our final answer is 9\u221a3.

Consider the equation x^2=16. \"Solving\" this equation means finding all the values of x that will make the equality true. Both x = 4 and x = -4 will work, and you can convince yourself of this by replacing x with this values in the original equation.  Now consider the operation sqrt(x) like we have in the comprehension exersices. For every value of x you choose, you get a number back. This is what we call a function, and we decide that it is important that for every x we pick, we get only one number back. Why do we decide this? Because otherwise the function is not very usefull to us. So while both +4 and -4 is a perfectly good answer to sqrt(16), we can only pick one, and so we pick 4 because historically we are biased towards positive numbers :)  So while the two cases might at first seem the same (you solve the equation by taking the square root of both sides for instance), they are in fact seperate although related consepts.

So the reason for this is if you look at x=4 we can put this in the equasion 2\u221a8^2 = 8^2/3. The reason why this is the same is we can start by the first step amd just look at 3\u221a8^2. 8^2 = 64. So that leaves 3\u221a64. The cube root of 64 is 4. (4\u00d74\u00d74= 64). \u00d7=4   If we go to 8^2/3 this is the complicated part. You can first cube root the 8 which makes 2 (2\u00d72\u00d72).   This leaves (2^3)^2/3. By the rules you can make this 2^3 \u00d7^ 2/3. If we now only look at 3 \u00d7 2/3 it will make sense  2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 =6 /3 = 2.
