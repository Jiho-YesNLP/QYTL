This video is educational, but human embryonic development is much more complex than this. Unlike animals such as sea urchins, after being the morula mammals don't become a blastula, they become a blastocyst, and after a process called compation, where outer and inner cells are differentiated, water follows ions into the intercellular spaces, and thus a blastocel is formed. The outer cells become the trophoblast, which is divided into the inner cytotrophoblast and the outer syntitiotrophoblast, which grows into the decidua of the uterus and later on becomes the placenta. The cytotrophoblast contains the embryoblast, which is comprised out of the epiblast, inside of which the amniotic cavity is formed, and the hypoblast, which creates the Heuser membrane, creating the wall of the primary yolk sac. Then it gets even more complicated with the extraembryonic mesoderm (or, due to historical reasons, mesenchyme), which divides into parietal and visceral parts and then combination of this and trophoblast forms the chorion, etc, etc. Gastrulation occurs in the epiblast, where the epiblast cells migrate towards the primitive streak, and in the process called invagination they are twisted inside, creating the three germ layers in humans - the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. And then you have the prechordal and notochordal plates, but that's even more complicated so I won't go into that much detail.
