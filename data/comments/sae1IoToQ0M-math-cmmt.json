The prime factorisation of 24 is 2*2*2*3 (this is what you did) The prime factorisation of 18 is 2*3*3  To find the least common multiple you take the multiples of each whole number from the factorisation that has the most. 24 has three of the number 2, while 18 only has one, so we take the three. 18 has two of the 3's, while 24 only has one, so we take the two:  2*2*2*3*3 = 72  The video does not explain why this works, so I guess thats a story for another time :)", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sae1IoToQ0M", "cid": "Ugz4-NYIfzNIRKDeNth4AaABAg.8pDGItkfkZPA-kGWI7vomN", "comment": "yes its easier but in some equations its more relevant to use LCM", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sae1IoToQ0M", "cid": "Ugw75U9iNLwQXfeqUNV4AaABAg.8WaowsvN8xK8jUtZtruFGh", "comment": "Timur nachname 2", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sae1IoToQ0M", "cid": "UgwKSZMnMMVoJR5diD14AaABAg.8W_264F9yyw8W_2JZxnikZ", "comment": "lowest = least, same thing!", "votes": "25", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sae1IoToQ0M", "cid": "UgwKSZMnMMVoJR5diD14AaABAg.8W_264F9yyw9EE_Y6Xqrmm", "comment": "\u00a0@ProfessorDaveExplains\u00a0 \ud83d\ude04", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sae1IoToQ0M", "cid": "UgyUsiywgc_QalDismd4AaABAg.8W_-KXU_Lxp9izTibUOXxb", "comment": "what if the GCD of both numbers is 1 ? then this formula will imply LCM^2 which is obviously incorrect", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "sae1IoToQ0M", "cid": "UgyUsiywgc_QalDismd4AaABAg.8W_-KXU_Lxp9j1vFhTVTwb", "comment": "\u00a0@mayankarora5377\u00a0 then the lcm(a,b)=a*b", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
