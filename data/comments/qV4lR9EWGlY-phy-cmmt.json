I didn't learn how to read music (other than strumming chords on a guitar) until I was almost 50... Or so I thought!!  I really did try my best... well, actually what I thought was my best, to learn how to play musical notes on the guitar when I was in middle school as well.  Honestly, I don't know if this is true for everyone but I was super surprised at what it took for me to understand fairly basic all-around music theory.  What it took for things to click for me was to 1st apply it on a piano rather than a guitar.  And to go even one stepfurther, if someone would have told me right off the bat how music theory is so dependant mathematics to the point of being inseperable, I would have looked at it from a completely different perspective.    BUT in as much as I know this to be soooo completely true/irrefreputable, it's still really hard to wrap my head around the very idea that such a creative artform such as music depends so heavily on something as technical as mathematics.  I guess that subconsciouly, I always felt like I had to hide one side of my brain or the other because having two dominant sides ofthe brain is an oxymoron \ud83e\udd37                \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9e\u270c\ufe0f", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgwPk1FBw1Lr1iV7y3J4AaABAg.99WrMtXMhPI99Wr_pxC_WK", "comment": "test", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgwPk1FBw1Lr1iV7y3J4AaABAg.99WrMtXMhPI99kDwzhGI9p", "comment": "\u00a0@greg1248\u00a0 yes I see you have tested.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgwPk1FBw1Lr1iV7y3J4AaABAg.99WrMtXMhPI99kjCiSDZEL", "comment": "\u00a0@HorizonSpeed26\u00a0 epic", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgxnhnfV1foRDFIryPZ4AaABAg.993jEjsMZgG99b_qWX4dR1", "comment": "Ehhhh, the amplitude of sound waves (I use sound as an example, but this is true for every longitudinal wave) is the maximum distance that the particles of the medium travel from the resting position.

Sound is produced when a body vibrates.         Sound needs a medium to travel. It cannot travel in vacuum.         Sound travels faster in solid medium (like wood) as compared to water and air.         All musical instruments have vibrating parts/which produce sound.         In human beings, sound is produced by the voice box or the larynx.         We hear through the vibration of our eardrum, whenever sound reaches our ears.         The number of oscillations per second is called the frequency of oscillation (f) and is expressed in hertz (Hz). A frquency of 1 Hz is one oscillation per second.         The time needed to complete one oscillation is called time period (T). Hence, the number of oscillations per unit time is the frequency of wave f = 1 /T.         The maximum displacement of the wave crest from the central position on either side is called its amplitude.         We differentiate sounds on the basis of their amplitudes and frequencies.         A human being can hear sound waves within a range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Some animals like dogs can hear sounds higher than 20,000 Hz.         The larger the amplitude of vibration, the louder is the sound.         Loudness of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound. The loudness is expressed in a unit called decibel (dB).         Shrillness or the pitch of a sound depends upon its frequency. Higher the frequency, higher is the pitch and vice-versa.         Unwanted, unpleasant sound is noise. Loud noise produces noise pollution, which is harmful and may cause hearing impairment.

(Yes, i know feom the individual explosions that are happening inside the combustion chamber, but its more complex). Also, why if your not in the right gear going up hill, and even tho your RPM hasn't changed, as you give it more gas,  the engine note changes. ( besides the obvious answer because you're giving it more gas there's a more complex answer). And finally, what makes a Ferrari V8 sound SO different that a Chevy or Ford V8, excluding size and exhaust layout.  I have an hypothesis. We will focus on one cylinder of an Engine of your choosing.  Engine takes in air and fuel, its compressed to around 120psi, ignition, rise and heat are produced and the piston gets pushed down, ( (very simple introduction). However , as the piston is at bottom dead center and before the exhaust valve opens, there still remains a calculatable pressure that remains.  Due to a volume of air now hotter than originally, there is still pressure inside the chamber. When the exhaust valve opens, rapidly even at idle and the piston is thruster upward, thoes hot exhaust gases, as hot as 50psi, are forced into the exhaust system and out the tailpipe. Now 50psi being forces out a narrow tube in ,even as low as .06 sec, is bound to \"carry a tone\"  what do u think", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgzuiQGNLOXVsdATk5h4AaABAg", "comment": "the math thoI didn't understand 1 thing", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgyNK7I7_mRlbudAW3N4AaABAg", "comment": "Yet again, 9th grade students in America have a hard time understanding the way and speed in which she speaks...not recommended for general public classrooms here.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgzVC-UXCyce4DqcyaB4AaABAg", "comment": "Anyone else notice how big her hands are", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgxsnalKbV7_4WDyDTp4AaABAg", "comment": "My eyes glaze over when the math starts LOL", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgyIwy3h_YVmfZMDG9p4AaABAg", "comment": "This is just what I nees to speed up my understanding before getting into the math used to describe the physics, btw nice Feynman books I have the spanish-english version, really nice book (I'm a native spanish speaker)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "UgyAhpaj5lkHUa-8i9V4AaABAg", "comment": "Wooow such  a great video, I love this chanel!", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "qV4lR9EWGlY", "cid": "Ugx6trRfQv-id_vQMAF4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks!

The diversity of topics and depth of insight is something that is, in my opinion, unrivaled by most other YouTube channels. The idea of this channel alone, that being videos of moderate length explaining a range of topics in detail, is priceless. Now more than ever it is vitally important to the American economy that our citizens be intellectually literate, especially in fields such as science and technology. Come to think of it, it may be a good idea for you guys to make a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) playlist. Just a thought.  On another note, what would you guys/girls (meaning whoever is reading this) of an interview series on Crash Course? It would be really interesting to see Crash Course collaborate with scientists, artists, authors, poets... etc. Couple that with longer interviews with the guest and I think it would have the potential to really grow the channel and even further diversify the content, appealing to a different breed of knowledge junkie. I can only hope that some high profile names in the various fields of expertise would be willing to collaborate. Richard Dawkins for biology, Lawrence Krauss for particle physics, Bill Nye for climate change and engineering, Cornell West for social and political reformation and history, and so on and so forth. I believe that and do of those names have collaborated with the channel Big Think (which is another channel that I love), and they have only have about 1/3rd of the amount of subscribers that Crash Course has. Not to mention their connection to PBS, which may hold some sway.

There is some element of assumption still in it.  Of course, if the assumption were invalid, it would have to be invalid in a very specific and systematic way to be consistent with observations.
