In your example the set of outcomes is countable set hence every event in your sigma algebra is countable and therefore has measure zero. Does it mean that if you flip a coin nothing happens? No, obviously not. From the beginning in the study of probability we divide the set of outcomes into two cases discrete or continuous. As you pointed out the counting measure which is just the cardinality of the event has a value 0 only when it is the empty set and by the axioms of probability it must be 0.

Yes, you are correct, the counting measure typically just 'counts' how many things are in a set, but remember we're in the context of probability here where total measure is 1. It does not make sense to only be able to count up to 1 thing. Thus the measure must be scaled in such a way as to preserve total probability. This is not so well defined at infinity, but it's clear for a finite # of outcomes n that we can simply divide the counting measure by n. Take n to infinity, and it's clear that finite sets have measure 0. This is what I was referring to.  Another more classical way to think about this is that for finitely many flips, the counting measure can be used to approximate the probability of a usual coin flip (1/2 heads, 1/2 tails, 0 for the side) by simply recording relative frequency and there you get the theoretical probabilities in the limit (including the 0 for the side) but this 0 for a coin landing on its side neednot have a recorded 0 occurrences out of infinitely many flips to have probability 0, it just needs to be finite.
