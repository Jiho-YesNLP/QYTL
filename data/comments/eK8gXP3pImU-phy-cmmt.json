I converted the number to .00132 and continued like this: .00132gallonx4qt/1 gallon x 0.946L/1qt x 1000mL/1L x 1tsp/5mL. this results in 0.998976, which I was told to round, which means 1tsp.

A length is a length whatever units you designate it in. With USA customary units there are a lot of different units and they have a size progression. In SI (metric) units there is only one length unit, the metre. There is a size order to USA units such as a point is smaller than an inch which is smaller than a foot which is smaller than a yard which is smaller than a fathom which is smaller than a furlong which is smaller than a mile. There are lots of intermediate customary units as well which are not in fashion such as rod, pole, perch, chain.
