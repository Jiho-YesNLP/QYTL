Stem Cells, Apoptosis and Tissue Homeostasis: 1) Epithelia (Histologically significant Tissue Type) and Epithelium Specific to the Intestinal Mucosa (Most Turnover Rate of all Tissue); a) Regeneration Rate at about 4-5 Days (Gastric Mucosa possible Daily); b) Highly Specialized Tissue Type and Therefore Differentiation Investigation Mechanism is possibly highly lucrative in Outcome (as Yamanaka Showed in 2012); c) Columnar Intestinal Mucosa (Villi, Crypts [Intestinal Stem Cells Growth Area], Microvilli and Enterocytes et al) is distinctly Structured as Parenchymal Tissue And Function are arranged along an Apical-Basal Polarity (similarly to Axon-Dendrite Polarity of Neural Tissue in Neurons) along with a Juxtacrine Adhesion Proteins critical and specific to Epithelium; d) Tissue Homeostasis State would be Rapid Regeneration for A Rapid Turnover Rate (Death Rate); e) Adult Stem Cells (Different from Developmental Stem Cells or Embryonic SCs [Totipotent and Pluripotent Capability]) are organ specific and Multipotent/Pluripotent Potency would be able to differentiation into a) Enterocyte, b) Enteroendocrine Cell Type; c) Goblet (Mucus Secreting Cell), Paneth Cell and another Stem Cell (SC) in order to maintain a Regenerative Capacity with a Niche (Site of Stem Cell Renewal usually towards the Base); e) Terminally Differentiated Cells within the Intestinal Epithelium Aforementioned; f) Cytoplasmic Membrane Markers are the Definitive Molecular Mechanism of Typification of any Cell; g) Cytokine Signaling functionality to Regulate differentiation and Specialization (Wnt Ligand [Frizzled Receptors are Specific to Wnt Ligand] for Differentiation via Wingless Dorsophila Mutant Investigations);  h) Regulatory Logic via Transcription Factor Kinetics (Enzyme Kinetics) of Beta-Catenin Degradation Signaling by Poly-ubiquitination (E3-Ligase Recruitment) and Proteolysis (Destruction Complex) thereafter, a non-Developmental Gene Expression while Positive Wnt Expression goes on to further Gene Expression therein (Stabilization of the Protein Complex Molecular Mechanism); 2) Apoptosis (Death Signaling of Functionality or Programmed Cell Death); a) Cellular Morphology is Characteristic in Shape, Size and Molecular Staining Properties (Pyknosis, Blebbing are examples); b) DNA Damage or Repairing Incapacity will Stimulate Signals for Apoptosis; c) Survival Signals are opposite to Death Signals (Signaling Progression of Cell Cycle or Other Mechanism); Nf-kB signals inflammation and is understood as a Survival Signal; d) Growth Factors (GFs) are protein Ligands specific to Cell Survival (growth and Proliferation Mechanism Activation); e) Transit Amplification is rapid replication and Mitoses Acceleration (a Risk Factor for Malignancy); TBC....PhD Adam Martin, es gut ist zu wachsen und verwachsen aber es muss zu ueberleben nur sein,  Heil!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "EJ6Sjn1c04Y", "cid": "UgysZgohHRLIFgPoH3Z4AaABAg", "comment": "Grow your own body parts Its your body .

My apologies, I should have been more sensitive to your emotions.  Rest assured that I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at how absurdly the camera is tracking, and comparing it to the type of tracking you would get from software (which conventionally does not do well in tracking objects, although newer software has improved significantly).  It was meant to be humorous, but it seems that it was taken in a negative light. I hope you can see what I was trying to say now. Sorry for the confusion.  p.s. I understand you, sometimes I take things too personally too.
