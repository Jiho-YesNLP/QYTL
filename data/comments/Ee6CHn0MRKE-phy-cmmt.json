Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE.  The tides are CLEARLY related to E=mc2 AND F=ma. These equations represent a balanced two dimensional surface OR SPACE ON BALANCE (as what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE). The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. The rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. Get a good LOOK at what is the fully illuminated AND setting Moon. Great. Compare this with what is the orange AND setting Sun on balance, as they are both the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE (ON BALANCE) !!! Great. c squared represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. Excellent. Notice the black \u201cspace\u201d in relation to what is THE EYE ON BALANCE, AS outer \u201cspace\u201d involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. The tides are CLEARLY, fundamentally, and necessarily related to F=ma AND E=mc2 (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!  Define \u201cmass\u201d. You can't. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.  WHY THE TIDES ARE NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/gravitational IN BALANCE, AS THE ROTATION OF WHAT IS THE MOON MATCHES IT'S REVOLUTION; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE:  Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. \u201cMass\u201d/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. This explains F=ma AND E=mc2. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE.  BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. Consider BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE !! It has to be this way in order for INVISIBLE bodily experience to be understood ON BALANCE. It's called QUANTUM GRAVITY. Consider what is THE MAN (AND THE EYE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. So, ON BALANCE, what is BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. Gravity is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be ELECTROMAGNETISM/gravity ON BALANCE.  If we understand E=mc2 and F=ma to be in balance, then gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. So, this then explains why the rotation of the Moon matches it's revolution. (The perpetual motion of the Moon is also CLEARLY accounted for.) The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Gravity and ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, as gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Accordingly, the planets will move away very, very, very slightly in relation to what is the Sun on balance. Consider the fully illuminated (and setting) Moon AND the orange (and setting) Sun when manifest at EYE LEVEL/body height. They are the same size as the eye AS WELL. NOW, the sky is blue; AND the Earth is also blue. The Moon is about one quarter (27 percent) the size of the Earth. The surface LAND area of the Earth is 29 percent, and this is precisely between one quarter and one third. The connection with lava is CLEAR. (Consider the role or relation of WHAT IS THE EYE ON BALANCE !!!) The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Lava even manifests as blood red. Indeed, it is a very great truth that THE SELF represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience. I have a preponderance of evidence that CLEARLY proves that the sizes of the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon AND orange (AND setting) Sun are not meaningless, random, or insignificant. Indeed, this is CLEARLY CONNECTED with the fact that the rotation of WHAT IS the Moon matches it's revolution. GREAT. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. Indeed, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be gravity ON BALANCE.  Finally, consider said WHITE Moon (on balance) in relation to what is the blue sky AND the tides.
