But that does not mean that b^0 is undefined. You are correct that for a positive exponent b^n is equivalent to the product of n times b. However, the power b^n also has a reciprocal 1/(b^n). It is also be written as: b^(-n)  Now what is b^2 * b^3? It is b^5 This actually generalises: b^n * b^m = b^(n+m)  And now you might answer what: b^n * b^(-n) is equal to.
