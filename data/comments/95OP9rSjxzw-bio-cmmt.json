He also greatly emphasizes certain agenda points with phrases like \u201cthere is not a shred of evidence to support that\u201d like when he discusses the idea that homosexuality can be caused by exposure to certain environmental elements such as molestation or an over bearing mother and absent father.  All of his data is unprovable by the common people. This is exactly like religion. Stating that there exists a place called heaven and hell even though no one can prove it.  These students are being brainwashed to accept everything on faith. Faith that these so called experts who write the research papers actually know what they are talking about and are not actually lying to push an agenda.  As with religion the information being dumped into the heads of the congregation is unprovable by them. Even though there is a mountain of evidence that can be made by personal experience and observation by the common people this guy only steers his students to believe in that which can not be proven by them.  This is mind control for the purposes of people control.  These students will then go out into the world as the new generations of \u201cexperts\u201d and teach the same false beliefs they were fooled into believing.  If you\u2019ve ever wondered how the world got so screwed up it is because of people being fooled by people presenting themselves as experts and authorities.  When I view this I see a priest teaching children about the existence of a man in the sky and a devil who wants to burn you for all eternity if you don\u2019t believe and follow what he is saying. And since nothing is provable the children blindly go into the world teaching others the same lies.

Actually even little differences seem to matter A LOT:  \"Men experience\u00a0sexual dysfunction\u00a0at testosterone levels of below 300\u00a0ng/dL, with men that have levels of testosterone of approximately 200\u00a0ng/dL often experiencing such problems.[29]\u00a0Complete loss of\u00a0testicular\u00a0testosterone production resulting in testosterone levels within the castrate range (95% decrease, to 15\u00a0ng/dL on average) with\u00a0surgical\u00a0or\u00a0medical castration\u00a0causes profound sexual dysfunction in men.[30][31]\u00a0Combined marked suppression of testicular testosterone production resulting in testosterone levels of just above the castrate/female range (70 to 80% decrease, to 100\u00a0ng/dL on average) and marked\u00a0androgen receptor\u00a0antagonism\u00a0with high-dosage\u00a0cyproterone acetate\u00a0monotherapy causes profound sexual dysfunction in men.[30][32]\u00a0Treatment of men with medical castration and add-back of multiple dosages of testosterone to restore testosterone levels (to a range of about 200 to 900\u00a0ng/dL) showed that testosterone dose-dependently restored sexual desire and erectile function in men.[33]\"  Seriously, I do not understand why Sapolsky tries so hard to talk down the massive importance of testosterone in men's sexuality. Testosterone is absolutely necessary to have any sexual behavior in men. It is even more important than having a sexual partner, such as a woman, as men with high levels in testosterone don't need a partner to engage in sexual behavior.

In the modern 'publish or perish' academic environment, publishing a study with controversial results can be the difference between a researcher getting their foot in the door with a reputable scientific research institution or taking a job as a potato chip seasoning engineer.

Now he is saying that AIS XY (female phenotype, male cromosomes) people identify as female because of social conditioning even though they have a fully masculinized brain.  This makes no sense, the actual reason they, in the majority of cases, especially in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) identify as female is that their brain is actually female, as proven by a recent article, and the reason is that whereas in rats only estrogen converted locally in the brain from testosterone plays a role in the masculization process, in humans androgen receptors play a key role (testosterone plays a direct role).  for more details see source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706155/", "votes": "12", "replies": "9", "reply": false}, {"vid": "95OP9rSjxzw", "cid": "UggPsJcKeg14NngCoAEC", "comment": "Clearly explains sexuality.

Culturally imposed monogamy reduces variance in reproductive success among males and reduces this inequality as a basis for conflict among males.  It may be of no particular advantage to women.  Half of a wealthy man is better than all of a poor one.  Your hypothesis definitely needs investigation and testing, if it's not already been done.   Men have likely always been obsessed with paternity, and culturally imposed monogamy  along with patriarchy might make it easier for men to prevent cuckoldry.

Most cultural norms come from looking at what is most common or works best and drawing an ought from an is, creating a social more from it and demanding that everyone fall in line. 'Just so' stories explain things that occur without promoting competitive reproductive success.   Even if something came about indirectly, but you can demonstrate that its benefits self select and encourage the process which produced it, it's not a spandral anymore. If you can point to where something is clearly advantageous, a load bearing column if you will, it is not a 'just so' story. Spandrals are always nonstructural. I think the professor goes way over the top with his ambiguity emphasis.   And fun factoid, early Christians were not monogamous, as the Bible never forbade polygamy. The Christian church adopted monogamy because it was a requisite Roman cultural norm. Christianity had to adapt to Roman cultural norms, or it never would have spread with the roman empire.   There are several well documented reasons why monogamous relationships produce stronger societies. Another angle is the 'tragedy of the commune' effect on male child rearing. When fathers don't know which children are theirs, they are more willing to help all the children. However, they do not contribute as many resources to all of them as a monogamous father would contribute to his personal child.

Additionally, two species that cannot normally breed together can do so by means of an intermediate species.     Additionally, you  completely misunderstood what Ghryst VanGhod said. He never said that the races were actually different species. In a sense, he said exactly what you did: that some races have neanderthal DNA.

An example is his rejection of separated twin studies, that prove how shockingly little a child's environment effects certain things, with the argument that they shared the same environment in the womb or in the first few hours of life. Those studies are so statistically demonstrative that you are still left with, at best, the conclusion that an enormous amount of what happens after the first few hours outside of the womb is irrelevant.  Another easy example is his understanding of the difference between sex and gender. In a previous lecture he correctly noted that we know the brain region that determines what gender people feel, and we can actually tell what gender someone will identify with by examining their brain regardless of what gender they were raised to be, with transgender people. Now his conclusion is that gender is entirely a function of culturalization in males who's brains do not androgynize that region but instead retain the female form? We know culturalization has virtually nothing to do with gender identity or sexual orientation. There are many other studies on these subjects.   Previously he made the neurologically incoherent claim that transgender people are not people who think they are the wrong sex because their brain tells them they are the opposite gender, they are people who are the wrong sex (or have the wrong body). Transgender people literally think they are the opposite sex. We know that their brain tells them they are, but their thoughts do not make them the 'wrong' sex. Regardless of how you treat it, this is the definition of a psychological disorder, and his statements on it were absurd from a neurological perspective.  I've noticed several errors, usually in drawing questionable conclusions or misplacing the emphasis on what level of effect the conclusion of a study has on the things he is actually talking about.
