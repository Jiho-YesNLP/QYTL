I could muster...  I want to use a TEC or multiple TECs for cooling a water system, I'm happy to power these and deal with cooling etc I'mnot that fussed about theor efficiency, however, these TEGs are always prefaced with being massively inefficient, so... if I run the TECs to do their cooling job, would it make sense for me to use TEGs as heat sinks, loop the power generated back into the system and recover 5% whilst efficiently cooling the TECs using the seekbeck effect? IE it will absorb the heat \"inefficiently\" doing exactly what I need it to whilst also recycling some of the heat generated, I'm guessing it would make more sense to have a heat sink to build up a stable heat in something then have the TEGs feeding off the heat of that? Rather than trying to stick them directly to each other like hot output of TEC to hot input of TEG?
