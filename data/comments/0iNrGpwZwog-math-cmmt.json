An application of the dot product, is mechanical work.   A dot product of a force and displacement vector yields the amount of work done on the object by the agent of the force, while the object moves a given displacement.  The better aligned the force and displacement are, the more effective the force is at doing work on the object.  A force that is perpendicular to the object's displacement cannot do any work on it, and can only change its direction or offset another force like gravity.   A force that is opposite an object's displacement does negative work on the object, slowing it down.   The closer to 180 degees apart the force and displacement are, the more effective it is at slowing it down.
