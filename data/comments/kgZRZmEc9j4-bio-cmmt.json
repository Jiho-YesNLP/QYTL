These arose after mammalia split from the sauropsids (common ancestors of birds and reptiles) and exhibit different degrees of complexity. The oldest surviving mammalian lineage is the monotremes - the egg-laying mammals - arose ~210 million years ago. Next we have the marsupials - pouched mammals - and the placentals - us and mice etc - appearing ~167million years ago. As the oldest lineage, monotrema retains the most ancestral (bird/reptile like) traits: egg laying, no teeth, a single hole for reproduction and excrement (the cloaca), reptilian hip and rib structure, lower body temperature (monotremes are 32 degrees compared to 37-39 in other mammals) but have mammalian adaptations including lactation and fur.. the marsupials have developed viviparity - live birth - but give birth to small under-developed young because they lack a true placenta. Marsupials also retain the cloaca. Marsupials and placentals have developed nipples, which are lacking from monotremes. The placental mammals have separate openings for excrement and reproduction, have viviparity, have a true placenta and improved umbilical chord which protects the foetus from the mother's immune system and so allows birth of large and well-developed young. All mammalian lineage have more complex immune systems than birds , with more diversity of immunoglobulin (anti-body) genes. The placental and marsupial, but not the monotreme, lineages have another kind of complexity that has arisen called genetic imprinting. This is like punctuation being added to DNA during the formation of sperm and egg. It doesnt change the sequence of the DNA, but it lets the genes retain information about which parent they came from. The effect is that a gene can be expressed differently depending on which parent it comes from. which is awesome and imposes non-Mendelian attributes.. yeah mammals are more complex :)\u00a0", "votes": "5", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "kgZRZmEc9j4", "cid": "UgifOg22rjXSMHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-0UfM7CqqoCl_EDT", "comment": "Kumquatodor\u00a0I'm not sure about that Kumquatodor, the Avian respiration system seems to be far more efficient than the Mammalian as Machiavelli pointed out.
