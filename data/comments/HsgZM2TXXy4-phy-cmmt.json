Less dense air means lower air pressure.  The air pressure difference between the top and bottom of the wing is what causes the lift. This is the principle behind Bernoulli's Equation, which says the energy in  the air between its pressure (the outward expanding force of a parcel of air and a form of energy density) and its kinetic energy (as given by the v squared terms) are conserved.  What causes a decrease in lift by ice buildup on wings? The drag on the air causes it to slow down, negating the pressure difference. Moreover, it causes turbulence at the trailing edge of the wing due to less airflow over the top of the wing.", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "HsgZM2TXXy4", "cid": "UgxzBGgteVDWUjnQ0Id4AaABAg", "comment": "Wonderful your explanation", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "HsgZM2TXXy4", "cid": "UgwMxufKZb5I5rJT08p4AaABAg", "comment": "You\u2019re an animal \u2764", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "HsgZM2TXXy4", "cid": "UgysF1J7HS8v37xafyB4AaABAg", "comment": "I like your videos about chemistry, but in this video, you get things wrong.  In example 1, you say that low pressure is formed over the top of the house. How? A lower pressure means the velocity of the air over the roof top must increase. Bernoulli's principle does not say \"when the velocity is high, the pressure is low\" and vice versa. Bernoulli's principle says when the velocity of an airflow changes, the static pressure changes in accordance with Bernoulli's equation. Therefore, you cannot use Bernoulli's equation to compare the airflow outside and inside a house with walls. You must compare the velocity of the air ahead of the house with the velocity of the air over the roof. With a flat roof, the lifting force will be very low.  In example 2, you describe lift in accorance with the \"equal transit\" hypothesis. Sadly, this idea is taught to student pilots all over the world, but it is not correct. Think about it: How can an air molecule that was separated from another air molecule by the wing know when the other air molecule will reach the trailing edge of the wing? Wind tunnel tests show that the air flowing over the wing reaches the trailing edge before the air flowing under the wing. If you search for \"Prof. Holger Babinsky\" and \"Lift\" you will see how it works.  Your drawing shows a wing with a flat undersurface and zero angle of attack. Therefore, the velocity of the air under the wing will have the same as the velocity of the airplane, and the static air pressure under the wing is the same as the static pressure in the atmosphere. To get a higher static pressure under the wing, the wing must meet the airflow with an angle, called the angle of attack. And don't forget when a wing produces lift, it deflects air downwards in accordance with Newton't third law of motion.

Although the acceleration caused by gravity is the same for every object, the force depends on the object's mass. Newton's 2nd Law states that Force = mass * acceleration, so to calculate the force of gravity on an object, you multiply the object's mass by g, or 9.8. The force of gravity on an object is also known as its weight. When two forces are in completely opposite directions on the same object, they can cancel out to some extent, just like subtraction. After subtracting the two (or more) forces from each other based on direction, the remainder is called the net force. In this particular problem, he is trying to figure out the vertical net force on the airplane. There are only two forces acting on the airplane in the vertical (up or down) direction: lift and gravity. Lift pushes the airplane upward, gravity pushes the airplane downward. I mentioned earlier that the force of gravity on an object is its weight, so what he does is he subtracts the weight and the lift force.
