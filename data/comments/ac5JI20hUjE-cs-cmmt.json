The order of magnitude of these two elements are microseconds for transmission delay and millisecond for propagation delay.  The propagation is infact the time the physical signal goes from the source to the destination and is calculated d(distance)/v(velocity), instead transmission delay is the time the node puts on the output link the data and is calculated L(bit)/B(velocity of transmission or bitrate in bit/s)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}]
