If there has been no network traffic on the network so far (or it has cleared) the switch tables will not be populated with the MAC address to Port relationship. Also, the ARP table on the PC/host will only contain its own MAC Address to IP address relationship. Sending a ping (or other packet) from one host to another would populate the MAC/ARP tables for these devices.  However, when you send a ping for the first time, the host PC knows the IP of the receiving device (because this is what you are pinging) but it does not yet know the MAC address of the other PC to send the packet to, so it sends an ARP request (broadcast to ffff.ffff.ffff) which the switch then sends out of every port except the incoming port the ARP packet was received on.  The ARP request is \u201csaying\u201d: Hello, my MAC is aaaa.aaaa.aaaa (IP 10.10.10.1), is there a computer on the same network with an IP address of 10.10.10.4?
