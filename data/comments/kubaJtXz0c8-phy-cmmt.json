A constant velocity is just meters per second.  When you accelerate, your velocity changes.  So each second, your velocity increases by a certain amount.  The change in velocity would be measured in meters per second, and since velocity itself is already in meters per second, the change in velocity would be meters per second....per second.  In other words, if you are traveling at 1 m/s, and begin to ACCELERATE at a rate that increases your velocity by 1 m/s....every second, then after one second, you'd be going 2 m/s.  After 3 seconds, 3 m/s.
