Dave says so in the video, but it went right over my head: Don't worry about getting 1 values in the matrix, focus only on getting 0 values. Once all but the rightmost value and one other value in a row are zeroed, you can divide both values by the coefficient non-zero value, which will convert the row to RREF and provide a solution.   2. It helps me to start zeroing from the top-right or bottom-left corner of the coefficient matrix. It almost feels like a game or a puzzle: Getting those corner values zeroed provides a solid base to start zeroing horizontally or vertically without accidentally limiting yourself to operations that would change a previously created zero.  Anyhow, hope that helps. If anyone has any other strategies, I'd love to hear them. Thanks for the video, Dave!

So as long as the person asking doesn't care about the method, it is perfectly valid to do what you propose.  By contrast, if you are in a class where you are learning GJE, they are probably expecting you to take the row operations all the way, and solve for all of the variables with the method you are being tested upon.
