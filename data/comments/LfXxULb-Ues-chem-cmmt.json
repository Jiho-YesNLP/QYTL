I just wanted to briefly thank you for these videos. I started university a month ago, and I had a terrible high school base for everything, and honestly I thought I was lost and that maybe I got the wrong choice. But your classes simply saved me in a way no other professor was ever able to put Chemistry in my head. My first test is tomorrow, and I still have some videos to go through, but I already expect better results than I did a week ago. Thank you very much for making this available.

I actually have a question about ionization energy and electronegativity. I understand that the more shells there are, the weaker the bonds. But i am having trouble with the second factor. What is the rule that affects electronegativity and ionization energy levels? If there are more electrons in valence shell is it weaker/ higher or less. It's all getting mixed up in my head. The top to to bottom and left to right rule is confusing.
