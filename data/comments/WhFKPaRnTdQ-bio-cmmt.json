But the stumble block to refute evolution is the absense of an alternative to the non Christian. The very first life was not possible without very very complex information running very complex and prescise processes in the cell coded into it.  And information requires intelligence.  I choose to believe in God as the intelligence which may seem absurt to you, but you choose to believe in chance as the giver of such complex code and that in turn sounds very absurt to me.  Evolution is not proven science and if you personally did not prove it, don't put your faith in some other historical scientist that also puts his faith in another historical scientist to think that evolution is proven.  Everybody thinks that the other historical scientist proved it and they can except it now.  Newsfash, it is not proven.  The museums are still missing thousands of missing links, if evolution was true we would have a lot of progressively changing fossils on display in the museums.  But we don't, and I would think the reason is that most of the fossils formed as a result of Noah's flood.  All that I am asking is for you to leave your religion aside and keep on sharing the awesome science.

Killerbee, u have actually demonstrated an arrogant close-mindedness, so typical for the modern indoctrinated atheist, not intelligence. Basically the same as the indoctrinated christian, just the polar opposite. In the way that Jack here understands religion and science, no, they should not be mutually exclusive. He says he knows and trusts in the principles of science, but that doesnt exclude the existence of a creator. First of all, let ppl believe what they will, its not ur place to judge. U say ur not here to push ur beliefs onto others, but u get condescending when u disagree. Second of all, and probably most relevant, is the idea that science excludes the existence of a higher power.  The big bang says that in the beginning the universe was a small point of highly condensed energy held together by gravity, to the point that gravity could not withstand the force of internal pressure, causing it to explode into a three dimensional space where the laws of physics and chemistry can now shape the universe as we know it. Well where did that small ball of energy come from to begin with? Or if u believe in the Big Crunch, how did that come about? The point is, where is the starting point. It all boils down to one simple question: Why does anything exist? its a question that has been asked by the ancients, and still remains a mystery today. Not even quantum mechanics can answer that. So no, you are wrong to say that science excludes the existence of a creator. And i cant really call myself religious. Call it God, Source, the Universe, whether ur christian, buddhist, or atheist; its all the same. And btw, the many religions u speak of carry an absurd amount of wisdom about life and humanity and many ancient societies were very scientifically advanced.  You might know some things about science, but u know nothing about philosophy.
