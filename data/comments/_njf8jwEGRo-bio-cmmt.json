Deduced premises have a strange way of worming their way into our survival reflexes and get clung to like an infant monkey to its mother's fur, where as the more open ended process of induction, the gathering and judgement of facts as valid or not, gets evicted from this ideally more symbiotic teamwork.    The dictatorship of the deduction will trump all data coming in, which basically means that the data will not come in to begin with.  This all occurs in the pesky realm of the human subconscious, a terra incognita if ever there was.  The evolution of the deductive premise dictatorship is largely due to the state of emergency experienced or imagined which shifts brain functioning from the contemplative endorphin state to the fight or flight adrenaline state.  The key to this global arrangement lies in the notion of scarcity vs. surplus.  Humanity, until the Industrial Revolution, has evolved in a state of Malthusian scarcity for 10,000 years, probably more, given the vicissitudes of Nature.   The library of Toledo was a catalyst to these effects of knowledge.  HOWEVER, it must be admitted that 800 years of Islamic intellect failed to have produced an Industrial Revolution whereas 1200 AD Europe did just that once this new endorphin driven psychology suffused a merchant class that underwrote the Florentine Renaissance of speed of light VISUAL CUE apperception using high resolution visual Gestalt simultaneous contour overlap rather than auditory cue low resolution 720mph sequential uptake.

If they truly are chaotic, then there is no prediction to be had. OHHH I just figured it out I think. Chaotic systems are not completely unpredictable. Like the butterfly graph was showing, they orbit a perfect pattern and what our science does is pick out that pattern. Ok but that's just the scientific method - not reductionism right? Reductionism is trying to understand the parts so you can predict with perfect certainty what will happen with a system while the scientific method (as I understand it) is just saying, \"hm. that system seems to be doing something approximating x. Let's run that back over and over and see if x holds.\" Using the scientific method, you get what he was talking about at the end - that is, the pattern that chaotic systems tend towards but inevitably break out of.

I can feel he's not an expert on mathematics: The thing is coordinates do actually repeat, as this is a direct implication from any given lines crossing eachother (two lines that cross, by definition, is that they share at least one point in common). In the graph he draw (aswell as the one he's reffering to, which i know because i did maths and i also read the book Chaos), there's an infinite number of lines crossing at eachtoher all the times, thus, there's infinite lines which share infite points with other lines. So YES, you do get point coordinates from different patches of curve that are exactly the same, and that is at the crossings, which DO exist. Where these minor variations he's giving so much importance occur (this is what i thing he's not understanding well), is not at the coordinates each curve seems to cross another one, but at the inclination each curve has on any given crossing. The inclination shows where each curve is going to, so if the inclination at a point where 2 curves cross doesnt correlate, you know those 2 curves are not the same, and thus they will follow different paths afterwards.  Summing up: curves DO cross eachother, and where the minor variations occur, is at the angle each curve has on any given crossing. If you found a crossing where 2 curves had the same inclination, then those curves would be the same, and you'd had found a periodic system.

A case in point are perspectives. Everything has many valid partial perspectives (from different angles or from different levels) which you would want to combine into a whole. Trying to reduce a variety of perspective (the variability) to one perspective would be counterproductive, since you would be discarding all of the other equally valid perspectives from different vantage points, each a useful tool for various problems. A specific case is trying to define 'life'. If you try to deduce it down to one sentence, then you are being foolish, since 'life' can be correctly described from many vantage points (physics: atoms; chemistry: molecules; biology: cells; taxonomy: body plans; mechanics: machines; systems theory: self-regulation; consciousness: self-preservation; philosophy: proaction vs. reaction), just as it can be classified in many useful (but non-universal) ways. So you have to be careful when deconstructing something, or you may be throwing out all but one of your tools in your toolbox when there is more than one problem still to solve out there and which require different tools.   As for human behavior, the Philosophy of Broader Survival sums it up at the broadest level: i.e. that so far, humans have been Universally Clueless (as defined by the philosophy). They are still living in their Clueless Era, which future enlightened being (enlightened by the philosophy) will preserve in museums (in their Human Clueless Era wings) so as not to forget or repeat their clueless (and absolutely deplorable) past (which current humans are still creating - congratulations) (sarcasm intended).  As for 'component parts', that too is but one perspective, and a limiting one if that is your only perspective. For example, looking for physical component parts will blind you to different levels, especially of function and processes. If you want to roll 'levels' and 'functions' and 'processes' into the phrase 'component parts', then you are into communication confusion, using one word for too many individually identifiable things.

The proof lies in those of two theorems; Fermat's Last Theorem, and that of Goldbach's conjecture.  I will provide a 6 line proof of Fermat's last theorem below; for Goldbach, I require a beer and pizza.  1.  There are no negative numbers (a \"length\" requires two origins, and negativity only results from a difference \"traveling\" between origins.  For a single origin, all values are positive definite, and if only one value x = ct, then it is prime, with 1_ct = ct/ct and 1_(ct^2) = (ct)^2/(ct)^2  etc. 2.  If there is a second origin that does NOT interact with the first, it is also a prime number y = vt' 3.  If it does interact, they must interact at the same place with ct' = ct + vt\"  and (ct')^ 2 = (ct)^2 + (vt')^2 + 2(ct)(vt') noting that ct and vt' change each other via the interaction.  (there is more to this story, but I don't have the spacetime to write it here.)  Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for Village Idiots Let a,b,c,n be positive integers Let c = a  + b Then c^2 = a^2  + b^2 + 2ab  (Binomial Theorem for case n= 2) For general n, Binomial Theorem yields c^n = a^n + b^n + f(a,b,n) where f(a,b,n) > 0 c^n = a^n + b^n iff f(a,b,n) = 0 f(a,b,n) <> 0 c^n <> a^n + b^n  QED  This has profound consequences for foundation of mathematical physics and philosophy There is Me and Thee, but I'm not altogether sure about Thee Count(Me) = 1 count of (Thee) = 1 -> 1+1 = 2 (Me + Thee)^2 = Me^2 + Thee^2 + 2 MeThee  (1 + 1)^2 = 1^2 + 1^1 + 2(1^) =4  (not two, as Pauli claims )  There is Me and the Universe There is Me and god There is Light and Matter  etc, etc, ad infinitum, ad nauseam  And for multinomials, there may be more than me and thee,  But I digress.

Nor am I an expert on mathematics, but I do have a degree in physics with a minor in mathematics.  In an open system, this presumption of chaos in the systems we observe in human and biological studies would be correct.  However, in a closed system, it cannot be, and a repetitive condition must occur. In the case of mathematics, this is an open system because it's very theoretical, and for the most part, poorly describes our universe, has many contradictions, and seems to lack some fundamental property that we're all missing, primarily because it's built upon whole integers (and the stuff in-between them) and the base-10 decimal system. An example of having a poor number system was the Roman numeral.  Early Europeans were still using Roman numerals until Fibonacci brought the Arabic numeral system other European mathematicians, but because it was \"Arabic\", it didn't make widespread use until the 15th century.  If you don't think that the Arabic numeral system is handy, try calculating interest with Roman numerals.  Or try doing geometry, sines and cosines. Could there be a better system of mathematics that we don't know about? At any rate, the next big question is whether or not the universe is an open or closed system.  Notwithstanding the infinite complexities of our current mathematical systems and it's long list of unsolvable problems and anomalies, almost all of these chaotic systems exist only in computers and mathematics.  These instances have little to do with the real world, except that such seemingly simple systems appear to have properties associated with chaotic systems, and may even have formulas to describe them.  The number Pi, for instance.  And the arrangement and order of petals on some flowers as well. If the universe is an open system, then certainly we can ascribe the instances, and indeed, perhaps all things in the universe to having a chaotic nature. If the universe is a closed system, then it depends on whether the universe's exists in an infinite time frame, or the frame is finite. On a finite time frame then, such chaotic systems can exist. On an infinite time frame, all probabilities must exist, including the repetition of any event, and in fact, all events. The problem is that we don't know the answers to any of these questions. I'll borrow this quote to end my thoughts, here, \"According to Feynman: I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, \"Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass\" \"Why?\" \"Because, they are all the same electron!\"\" I'm certain that this opened a can of worms somewhere in the philosophical community.  However, if it's true, then we're one step closer to a closed universe that ends in a cycle.  That is, infinite, but finitely closed.

Proof of the failure of reductionism isn't demonstrated by these points. I may still be able to predict your reaction to this center if I had all the relevant information at the starting system. Science just hasn't uncovered all the relevant information and it is absurd to think we have... The same can be said for the fish. To think that the only relevant information to predict dominance in a group of fish together is their dominance in separated pairs as proof reductionist doesn't work forgets that other variables unknown to the researchers could have been examined to determine that result. If you had all the relevant information in the big bang you may be able to perfectly predict which fish will look at which first resulting in the dominance hierarchical pattern. If you put together all the exponentially halved pieces of a cloud amd compare them before putting them together you might notice that you can predict what is wrong rather than ignoring the whole. You can take 1% of a system that is different along its occupied space and think you have all the information to predict what the other 99% is like. However, if u measured all the relevant molecules in the higher entropy system (cloud) you will be able to predict the future outcome of the whole (rain output).  . .. ... .. . This goes all the way down to people thinking that just because the quantum wave function seems to randomly collapse in a certain outcome, that it means it actually wasrandom and not due to some currently undiscovered variable.... Previously people thought supernatural forces controlled things that we now know can be predicted by measuring variables we discovered as being relevant........ knowing all the relevant information of here would allow one to predict any part of what people without all the relevant information currently call chaos or randomness.

It was the Scribes who wrote - via here-say, and compiled the old testament, along with the Pharisee's (leaders of the Synagogues).  Not one single book was even written by the supposed prophet, claimed as having said what was written, and even those were written sometimes hundreds of years later.   The very same leaders and scripture writers whom the written 'Jesus' (which isn't even a Hebrew name) despised.   Then consider the 'council of 300' (Wealthy, religious and otherwise) Elites (hmmm, we should trust them as well) led by a Roman Emperor (Oh yes, they can be trusted) who supposedly turned his faith to his God, along with all the other so called religious sycophants from around the world, decided amongst 100s of scriptures' around the ancient world, which ones to include and how to edit them as well. Who exactly were these 300 people and are we supposed to believe them, when it is a known fact that the old religions of Rome were being laughed at and scorned by the people, therefore a need for revision?    This all compiled by the so called \"Holy Roman Church\", filled with psychopathic Senators, Pedophile priests and Jesuit madmen and enforced throughout  the world by their henchmen? Yet people still believe it all?   There are still ancient paintings on some of the Vatican Buildings (at the rear) of Senators etc.   This means the Vatican is actually the very same Senate buildings of old as well. Now I have to assume that the entirety of the collections are most likely in the Vatican library (off limits to the public) or destroyed or both. These (New Testament scriptures) all written in Greek, which as any historian of any credit will tell you, are always written, without a single instance, as Aphorism and metaphors (parables themselves are metaphors). Not one single iota of factual evidence exists for any single script as to Orthodoxic truth... It even states, as an axiom, that Jesus (again here-say decades later) said \" I speak in foolishness so that the wicked shall see, but not understand, hear, but not comprehend, but I tell you (the Apostles) what the real meanings are. That is it's truth. The entirety of the bible is meant to be understood as metaphoric knowledge. Never as actual written happenings! What this means is that God put the foolish thought's into the writers and compilers minds as foolishness, so that they would believe they had the perfect pseudo religious propaganda and devious thieving and controlling system in place which still permeates today in every believer. The Vatican is so rich from it's theft that it staggers the mind. So is the Anglican Church, which also rewrote their KJV according to the King's (OOH we trust them too don't we?) authorization of what translation of the old Greek and Latin would be allowed. Now people are going hog wild believing the end is nigh, not comprehending for a moment that it is these very same Aristocratic relatives whom are making the very Apocalyptic things happen, even putting suspicious numbers (666) in their vaxxes and on their bar codes etc. (the real beast known as mammon which everything bought or sold.  basically already has). They even created the worlds first 'Fed' - The 'City of London' banking community in September 1666 by edict of the King, who needed to borrow a lot of money for his wars and to pay for the great fire of London and the \"Cest Que Vie\" act, (which is also Roman Catholic) and is for and about the Maritime Admiralty Law of the sea - a bamboozle known by most educated people.  It is it's own legal country along with the Vatican.  (religious) and Washington DC. (political), all legal by United Nations Decree? This Legislation managed to take over practically every Kingdom and Governmental system in the world, to our utter un-denounced regret, I might add. They, in effect, ripped up the Magna Carta and created the so called \"constitution\" in every English speaking and others, country as well but care not as they know it is an unsigned document which practically every single voter actually knows much about. An unsigned document holds no weight in their courts. Their courts are merely service corporations, again hoodwinking silly \"patriots\". see https://sagaciousnewsnetwork.net/the-corporation-of-the-united-states-of-america/   .Now it is becoming apparent that 1000 years of so called 'history' is written mostly by Catholic monks (that's not suspicious).

I have two degrees and an advanced diploma in psycholinguistics and all those years of education are a wheat grain compared to what I have learned *because I\u2019m truly interested in it*. I then learned ten or twenty times as much  knowledge by just reading books that sounded interesting or taking free courses online from MIT and Stanford etc. by learning about things I was passionate about in some way I learned so much more.  Also, working on the street helping the homeless and addicted taught me more psychology than my sacred honours degree in cognitive sciences did. Getting a crappy piano caused the creation of more sonatas, concertos and string quartets than a music degree did.  When I got my music degree I ALREADY KNEW EVERYTHING THEY WERE TEACHING! The professors even said after my first year I didn\u2019t need to continue in the music composition degree unless I wanted to be a teacher because I knew everything they were going to teach me! How? Because I was passionate about music. As a teen before university I would hear a beautiful song and get the sheet music and analyze it for days, weeks. I learned counterpoint and harmony from scratch by getting Bach quartet sheet music and thinking \u201chow the hell does he make it sound so good???\u201d I would read the sheet music and make notes on it. First one I figured out was that every note on the beat was part of a chord but the notes not on the beat would be in between the first chord and the next chord. And similar figuring out on and on and on. To the point I knew a degrees worth when I entered the music degree! Also I was a concert pianist during university- I never took a class or practiced in my life. I took one class and he said I was already past what he could teach me. I didn\u2019t practice scales over and over or arpeggios or chords or do etudes or even play other peoples piano music. I literally sat down in front of the piano and saw white keys and black keys and it was low to the left and high to the right, I would push the keys down and yuck, try again yuck again again again and bit by bit I learned piano to master class level. I can play anything. However, as a result of being absolutely self taught, my music is incredibly hard for people taught the normal way to play. Because I didn\u2019t have some person or book droning on about you have to do it like this or that blah blah blah. So my piano music for instance most music uses sets of four note. Do do do do - do do do do - dooooooo. I have 4 fingers and a thumb so instead I would use quintuplets as my basic form. And because I have an amazingly wide finger reach I wrote huge 6 note chords for one hand. It was new, it was different, I wasn\u2019t just following along. In music school I was allowed to skip most classes except the tests and performances. People called me Mozart in a jealous sarcasm, I was the star of the school. I composed on music paper but in an original way, as fractals, a fellow student bought one of my pieces for $300 and framed it because it looked like art visually so different. Point isn\u2019t I\u2019m awesome. Point is *everyone is awesome but life and schooling beats us down and tells us we are less than we are*. I am so happy you\u2019ve found something in this and if you ever want help learning any subject you can message me and I\u2019ll make you a set of videos or a book list so you can learn the subject as deep as you want to!

After three years of winning the lottery, they are right back where they were, but with a little less.  Back at LSU, my first 2 roommates were h s football players.   They spent the whole semester complaining about not getting 1000 yards in high school.   They never studied, never went to class.       50% of the student body were 18 year olds that went to college for the football games and to party.     Every semester they were ruthlessly culled out, and replaced by a new set of 18 year olds.       The professors would be pleasantly shocked when I asked to see my final, and asked what did I miss.

Which I think helps both with getting a better understanding of the culmulation of scientific knowledge, as with stimulation of critical thinking.   In my experience testing in my bachelor degree was also too much about reproduction of earlier explained knowledge, as opposed to more critical engagement, probably because it is easier (and cheaper) to review.

I can't think of any concert pianist who doesn't need to practise.  It's one thing to be able to sight read, but to play a great concerto or sonata at a standard that people would want to pay for in a concert hall or in a recording requires talent plus skill that only comes through practice and introspection.  An aptitude for climbing may get you to the top of the mountain more quickly, but it still has to be climbed, and developing the requisite skills is much more easily done within a community of other climbers, whose accumulated experience is available to learn from, rather than having to rely on trial and error, which is draining and time-consuming.  Even genius has to be nurtured.  Did European humans suddenly become more innately intelligent after the discovery of the library in Toledo mentioned by Dr. Sapolsky?  No, they did not.  People were able to acquire knowledge from previous generations that had been lost during the dark ages, and they also came together in pursuit of that knowledge.

I have several years of college experience and while I have learned a lot I definitely don't believe it is for everyone nor that it has some great intrinsic value.  Bear in mind I am an autistic genius by nature and have done extraordinarily well in college in terms of academic performance. Even so, I have been increasingly disillusioned from the fantasy of knowledge and education being the holy grail. There is way more to life than learning through formal education or even personal studying. There are way too many things in life that could be learned for a single person to actually learn them. Arbitrary learning is a practice in futility. Although there are many valuable things you could learn they pretty much all fall under the umbrella of applicable skills. It really only makes sense to focus heavily on them if you are likely to apply them in some beneficial way.  I think it would do our societies a lot of good if less people would waste their time learning arbitrary things pursuing a fool's errand of endless knowledge. We need people to focus on useful information that they are likely to apply in the real world.  That said, if you are 75 the most important things in your life have hopefully been accomplished and wishing you had more education seems like a pretty pessimistic way to view the life you have lived. Think of all the other things you got a chance to experience. Maybe you had a husband. Maybe you had kids. Maybe you had grandkids. Maybe your life was better because you had more time for those things.  Let's be honest, education in its most useful application is pretty much a way to achieve wealth and prestige. Neither of those things should matter much at your age.  You bet I'm obsessed with learning and pursuing education and all of that. I have been all of my life. You know why? Because I'm the autistic genius type which exists predominately to serve the purpose of finding new discoveries and sharing them with the rest of the species (for kin/group selection we can presume). Furthermore, as a young adult I'm pursuing wealth and prestige. You bet I am. I have a responsibility to use my unique abilities as a \"gift\" because otherwise it could be a curse. Being an autistic genius isn't fantastic but when you get lemons make lemonade. I want to use my natural abilities as a power to take care of my family and contribute to the world. That said, if I didn't believe in these significant purposes for my knowledge I certainly wouldn't waste my time pursuing endless arbitrary information.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "_njf8jwEGRo", "cid": "Ugye4aFmOCC1PDMnPJF4AaABAg.9R0lRA3LzejA6bTdiPz8od", "comment": "Any teacher with a passion for knowledge-seeking would prefer you as a student over the privileged brats that typically show up at Stanford.

Yeah, imaginary numbers are part of the solution. That doesn't mean they are a myth, that means you need to use systems of differential equations to solve them. The diagram on the right that you drew has a strong resemblance to the location of an electron in a pi orbital of a diatomic molecule. Its position can be solved probabilistically with the Schrodinger equation. The system remains without predetermination, but with a limited set of possible outcomes and a predictable probability distribution through out its possible states. The complexity phenomenon you are referring to about the breaking point in the number of states of a system is analogous to the ionization energy of an electron as well. It is a physical repercussion of having a system with quantized states that follows Pauli's exclusion principle.

He was no slouch, considering he was in a legal battle Newton as to who invented calculus  We are all scale free, strange attractors, non reductive, un-predictable beings. (Take that, Big Tech/Social media.)  Leibniz\u2019s Monads also were \u201cthe same at infinitely different scales of magnification\u201d, as Professor Sapolsky put it here. Was Leibniz being prescient of fractal geometry?...  \u201cIt\u2019s not noise, it\u2019s the system.\u201d  It would seem to me that the two qualities of variability and infinite scale have not been joined in any necessary way. Leibniz also solved this from the get go. Like cells becoming organs, becoming organ systems, becoming an organism, every monad, a point of perspective that aggregates into larger points (monads or souls) is non material, spiritual in nature,  or one could say \u201cinfinitely variable.\u201d   Yet, This variability found its source in the entire universe, as  each monad was simply a microcosm of that (infinitely variable) universe. Here we have the infinite scale idea again. \u201cAs above , so below\u201d.   Anyway Leibniz elsewhere states the same concept of a fractal-like nature of reality., that worlds live within worlds.  It would seem that modern science has caught up with Leibniz. And has provided more rigorous theoretical underpinnings as shown in this excellent talk.   This is why I believe Leibniz was a closet astrologer, just as Newton was a closet Alchemist. (This is my original thesis.)  I will take this a step further is not the word \u201cchaos\u201d just another attempt by the scientific mind at reductionism? By simply applying a label? Trying to reign in an apparent disorder.? Is not this the scientific bias at work again?    Chaos implies meaninglessness. Perhaps there is meaning in the chaos. Therefore it would not be chaos at all. There must be relevant implicate information in said chaos.   As you see, Leibniz, as a great diplomat and synthesizer of religion and science (a Lutheran)  was here trying to order the disorder, through a type of transcendent  function .  A holographic approach. Here the elegance and simplicity, which was always his aim, is shown once again.  \u201cOne must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.\u201d -  \u201cFriedrich Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra   Monadology in 90 min audio book:   https://youtu.be/T-PHq4EIOj8", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "_njf8jwEGRo", "cid": "UgxueQlHtQgqiIADVgB4AaABAg", "comment": "the square root of 2 eh~!
