If the battery\u2019s net charge is zero, then for a 12 V battery, one terminal would be at a potential of +6 V with respect to a conductor at infinity, while the other terminal would be at \u20136 V. At the physical center in the space between the two terminals of the battery, the voltage is zero. If we then connect a small wire to, say, the positive terminal, a few excess point charges will move onto the wire, and that wire will now be at the same potential as the battery terminal: +6 V. The wire will be surrounded by an e-field, and since the lines of electrostatic flux must always terminate upon charges, the wires must possess an excess surface charge.   In the above we assumed the net charge of the battery was zero. Supposing that the battery had a net charge. Then how would the charges, potentials and voltage be changed?   Before we answer this, it would be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level. Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two as in the following two videos: i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and  ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo   Returning to our question of the voltage of the single wire connected to one battery terminal,\u00a0 we assume the net charge of the battery was not initially zero. Perhaps someone with rubber-sole shoes carried the battery while walking on a wool carpet or perhaps the battery was charged to \u20135000 V, and would deliver a tiny spark if touched. In that case one terminal would still be 12 V different than the other terminal, perhaps \u20135000 V on the positive terminal and \u20135012 V on the negative.   It is not possible in this brief post to discuss in more detail the process of production of the voltage of the single wire without a detailed discussion of the capacitance and potential of single conductors. The last frame References in video #1\u00a0 lists textbook 4 which discusses these topics comprehensively using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of voltage of a single short and long wire with and without a net charge on the battery.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LzKMQByFSLc", "cid": "UgySxM0hS7ItJBG_62R4AaABAg", "comment": "Physics PDF Worksheets:            https://www.video-tutor.net/physics-basic-introduction.html\r Full-Length Videos & Exams:       https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor/collections Full 1 Hour 36 Minute Video:       https://www.patreon.com/MathScienceTutor\r Direct Link to The Full Video:       https://bit.ly/3GJyRx5", "votes": "55", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LzKMQByFSLc", "cid": "Ugwst3Tvf5pLI_pJhmp4AaABAg", "comment": "ohh my me! this is true GOD!!!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "LzKMQByFSLc", "cid": "Ugwg2BZuwXLnU6sBBJV4AaABAg", "comment": "For question 3, because the charge first decelerates from B to A, then comes to a stop, then accelerates towards C, wouldn't the total work done on the charge be positive, the potential energy be decreasing and KE increasing?
