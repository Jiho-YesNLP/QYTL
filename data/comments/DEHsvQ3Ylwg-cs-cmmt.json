Also observation bias might have tainted participant posts because they're unconsciously altering their posts because they their activity will be monitored by the researchers.

If you don't believe you're being studied you act naturally it doesn't take a masters in psychology to understand that. Social media is the ultimate tool for social manipulation, that and it's a profitable business since users aren't your customers; advertisers buying access to personal data is more unethical and yet it's legal. Despite this being public knowledge major segments of society still use facebook like the mindless sheep they are. Buying the brands they're coerced into thinking they chose to buy on their own and the same can be said about their changing views on social/political issues. You think you chose your values but they're the result of selective exposure to a mix of outrageous stories that de-legitimize one side of an issue while being exposed to equally provocative stories that frame the alternate side of the issue in a positive light or as the victim of the other side. But this isn't unethical, it's facebook's primary business model. Paranoia doesn't mean someone is crazy, paranoid people only appear crazy if they're wrong. Question everything. Irrefutable evidence exists but lots of \"evidence\" is hidden only to be revealed by whistle blowers or anonymous individuals who have their own motives for revealing truth.

That sounds quite normal.

That could be kind of normal, though usually there is enough evidence to discredit that for non-schizophrenic people.
