The Calc 1/Calc 2 level answer is: most of the time, yes.  The Calc 3 and DiffEQ answer is, definite integrals can also be functions, and very often are.  If the function doesn't have any variables in it, other than the variable of integration, then a definite integral is always a number, in contrast from an indefinite integral being a family of functions that only differ by the arbitrary constant.  There are applications of definite integrals, where the function being integrated either contains a constant unrelated to the variable of integration, or one or both of the limits of integration are functions, such as multi-dimensional integrals.

In general, a complex logarithm, ln(z) is equal to ln(mod(z)) + i*arg(z)*k.   The function mod(z) is the modulus of z, which is an extension of absolute value, for real numbers, where it tells us how far from the origin the number is, as a positive number.  The function arg(z) is the argument of z, which is the angle CCW from +real, that locates the complex number, and k is any integer.  When z is a negative real number, arg(z) = pi, and the function reduces to ln(|z|) + i*pi*k.   The i*pi*k can therefore be part of your +C, and the log of a negative number has a real part that starts with the log of its absolute value.  The other part of your +C, can nullify this imaginary part, if you strategically select the right constant.  It is a half truth to say that the integral of 1/x dx is ln|x| + C, but it keeps it simple.
