I have always sucked at math and being slightly dyslexic doesn't help. I  really struggled with binary/hex when I was A+Certified  wen the dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but you made it easy to understand. I'm 61 an have been a auto tech most of my life. I was fixing  ECM issues back when there was no internet and I had to go to he library to get resistance values for sensors. It was around $40k for 'Alldata' system, and I couldn't afford that, so I had to make due. Most private shops would turn ECM issues away and just send them to the dealer.  I am semi retired and live off grid, so I do stupid things like switch an inverter on without disconnecting a generator first. That is something transfer switch would handle, but I took me blowing 2 inverters to find out I can't trust myself and I get in too much of a hurry sometime. I am getting good at diagnosing circuit boards and am waiting for MOFSET's to repair both inverters. I know there are MOFSET drivers as well and will cross that bridge when I get to it. That will be soon.  I hope he blown MOFSET's acted like a fuse before it got to the drivers. I am familiar with software/hardware drivers, but IC hardware drivers are a mystery to me right now.  When you feed out of phase power into a circuit with a generator, the inverter will lose every time and fuses are useless because the 'alien' power is coming in reverse, and it happens before you can say \"oh shit\", and you cannot react fast enough to avoid damage. It appears that MOFSET's will asplode very quickly...But I have also had MOFSET's melt in small inverters for no apparent reason other than them being cheapo inverters that fail if the input voltage gets too low too many times and heat up.   THer is a protection circut tha is thhere and souns an alarm, but I am always sucking my batteries down to 10 VDC in tthe winter, because I'm too lazy to get out in the -0\u00b0 and fire a generator", "votes": "3", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "G1mZutobxDU", "cid": "Ugwm42YMgEUlFWtCKP14AaABAg", "comment": "Why didn\u2019t you convert the second example to kilo ohms and you said if a value is in thousand we should convert to kilo ohms", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "G1mZutobxDU", "cid": "UgyBMDcXlYz5w37fRBp4AaABAg", "comment": "I'm here as a refresher", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "G1mZutobxDU", "cid": "Ugz7Nb2dKKSZ0dKDW5l4AaABAg", "comment": "This helps alot", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "G1mZutobxDU", "cid": "Ugw6lTulbMbknFcIdch4AaABAg", "comment": "Thanks for all your help boss", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "G1mZutobxDU", "cid": "Ugwf0hPkdO5EJC-aH514AaABAg", "comment": "Am so so happy right now.
