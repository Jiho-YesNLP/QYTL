When a station has data to send, it first listens to the channel to see if \r anyone else is transmitting at that moment. If the channel is busy, the station waits until it \r becomes idle. When the station detects an idle channel, it transmits a frame. If a collision \r occurs, the station waits a random amount of time and starts all over again. The protocol is \r called 1-persistent because the station transmits with a probability of 1 when it finds the \r channel idle. A second carrier sense protocol is nonpersistent CSMA. In this protocol, a conscious attempt \r is made to be less greedy than in the previous one. Before sending, a station senses the \r channel. If no one else is sending, the station begins doing so itself. However, if the channel is \r already in use, the station does not continually sense it for the purpose of seizing it \r immediately upon detecting the end of the previous transmission. Instead, it waits a random \r period of time and then repeats the algorithm. Consequently, this algorithm leads to better \r channel utilization but longer delays than 1-persistent CSMA. \r The last protocol is p-persistent CSMA. It applies to slotted channels and works as follows. \r When a station becomes ready to send, it senses the channel. If it is idle, it transmits with a \r probability p. With a probability q = 1 - p, it defers until the next slot. If that slot is also idle, it \r either transmits or defers again, with probabilities p and q. This process is repeated until either \r the frame has been transmitted or another station has begun transmitting. In the latter case, \r the unlucky station acts as if there had been a collision (i.e., it waits a random time and starts \r again). If the station initially senses the channel busy, it waits until the next slot and applies \r the above algorithm.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "MAZi6VoekYw", "cid": "Ugy27QJ5UsGFQNrTchB4AaABAg", "comment": "is anyone else having trouble viewing this particular video on their website ?", "votes": "0", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "MAZi6VoekYw", "cid": "UgwEfRwQ-D4O9s9CDkJ4AaABAg", "comment": "mazaaa aagya \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude42", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "MAZi6VoekYw", "cid": "Ugw4vBTsFsomMUs71fV4AaABAg", "comment": "Sir please complete the full syllabus of computer networks ( network layer design issues) and other transport layer , session layer , presentation layer , application layer \ud83c\udf89)", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "MAZi6VoekYw", "cid": "Ugzd5gqZcmF1XCgfAdJ4AaABAg", "comment": "I LOVE YOU", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "MAZi6VoekYw", "cid": "UgxO76wd7IJiRpHQau14AaABAg", "comment": "What is the limit of that random time exactly ?
