Adding cores simply allows us to solve more of those problems at once. There will always be limits to how much we can multithread something. For example, if I wanted to find the average between two numbers, you must first add the numbers then divide by two or divide by two then add the numbers, although the second one is far less efficient. You can't have one thread adding the numbers and another thread dividing the numbers because the result of one is the input of the other. That's why so many applications take up a single thread. Tons of calculations done by computers are sequential, so to speed them up, we need faster cores, not more cores. More cores are nice, though, depending on the application. Faster cores are nice, always.  edit: It's up to the programmer and the compiler to parallelize. Having the OS do it would be way less efficient.
