While having a scientific method of studying on microscopic phenomena(atomic theory), at first, scientists make some postulates(assumptions) on atomic theory. Then next, they make  hypotheses on the postulates they have made on atomic theory. The hypothesis is like \"If these are our assumptions(or postulates) on atom then this will be the possible consequences\". After that they test  the hypothesis through experiments. If the hypothesis fails the experiment, they will change or modify their postulates to form a better hypothesis. At last if the hypotheses pass the experiment, the hypotheses will be accepted and will be considered as a theory as long as there is no evidence or experiment to conflict or contradict the hypotheses. Is this how a postulate and a hypothesis related to each other in scientific method of studying microscopic phenomena or phenomena beyond reality (like space-time curvature)?

The measurements (in S.I. units)of minima of uncertainties position and momentum of a particle of mass 1 nanogram is that their ratio is 1:4.
