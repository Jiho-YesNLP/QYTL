Chlorine (Cl) has an electronegativity of 3.0 whereas Sodium (Na) has an electronegativity of 0.9. When these two elements are brought together under the right conditions (temperature, pressure, etc), each atom of sodium will donate its electron to the chlorine atom so that they can both reach a more stable configuration (8 or 0 electrons in their valence shell).\u00a0  Covalent bonding is another kind of bonding in atoms. Atoms that have a smaller electronegativity difference (<1.5) form covalent bonds where instead of donating and receiving electrons, atoms share the electrons. E.g., H20 (water) where 1 atom of oxygen forms a covalent bond with each of the 2 hydrogen atoms. Polar covalent bonds are when the difference in electronegativity is greater (between 0.5 and 1.5), resulting in a slight positive charge on the less electronegative atom (in this case hydrogen) and a slight negative charge on the more electronegative atom (oxygen in this case of water).\u00a0  Hope this helps!", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "QnQe0xW_JY4", "cid": "UgzWXyjClHYHpDZ9e_54AaABAg.8wLEZDi-sNV8wODk0XCje9", "comment": "I'm pretty sure chemistry is a prereq for biology at my school (or you can take them at the same time) but I don't think it's that big of a deal if they'll let you take bio before chem BUT I also just graduated so I really don't remember wtf was in intro bio or chem or what you'd need for one of the other.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "QnQe0xW_JY4", "cid": "UgxaVZIh_Pl0lRkcnJ54AaABAg", "comment": "2x speed: the only way to watch crash course.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QnQe0xW_JY4", "cid": "UgzVfHZyYOiIiRZRpMJ4AaABAg", "comment": "No one:   Hank: WHY CARBON IS A TRAMP", "votes": "759", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QnQe0xW_JY4", "cid": "UgwIPRgIvOWgWh6TrL94AaABAg", "comment": "This is awesome, especially for a thirty something going back to school!", "votes": "2", "replies": "1", "reply": false}, {"vid": "QnQe0xW_JY4", "cid": "UgzRNnBPdJ9GVzylIi14AaABAg", "comment": "I hate your analogy.

By the time they get home, a vid with that word in it so frequently becomes a vid ABOUT it and problems may ensue. If you want to actually consider yourself a teacher, please keep that kind of thing in mind. If you are simply an individual knowledgeable abut a topic and are posting a vid about it, (e.g. a professional biologist or chemist)  that's fine, and enjoyable to adults who understand the context of those words and the joking nature of their relation to the topic.But to \"package\" these as suitable for younger audiences without being 'clean' is asking for problems. Plus, although I know you will not change this, you speak FAR too quickly in your videos.  I, and several other teachers I know of who use your vids, always slow the playback speed to 75%, It makes you sound slightly inebriated, but it makes your speech  easier to understand.
