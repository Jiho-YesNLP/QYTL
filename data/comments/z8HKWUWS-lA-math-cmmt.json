For some reason I thought the professor concluded that the proof is valid for all n >= 2 (think they say that in the newer playlist version of this course).  Maybe someone can either correct me here or be helped by it: If I got this all correct, it basically sums down to:  For n = 1 the base case is True, (trivial), however the inductive step breaks down since when you add a horse (n+1), your assumption (n horses) still only tells you that the first horse by itself is the same as it's own color and the second horse added also the same color as itself (they can still be different from each other). They need atleast one horse in common which is not possible for n = 1.  For n >= 2 the inductive step is True since the added horse (n+1) can be said to be the same color as the other horses in the set minus the first horse (still n horses, true from assumption). Therefore first horse and last (horse_n+1) is the same color.  Same logic as saying: if I have the same name as your friend Elliot, and you have the same name as Elliot, then you and I have the same name also. The friend here being the horses in the middle and you and I being first and last horse.  In the case of n = 1 there is no friend (horses in the middle) therefore I can't know if we have the same name.  However the base case for n >= 2 can not be shown to be true since you can't just say (as in the trivial case n=1) that the horses are the same color as itself. If you have n=2 for example, one horse can then be black and the other white.  Therefore the proof by induction is incorrect regardless of base case.

Reasonable use of axioms is accepted, with a focus on consistency. 01:49 \ud83d\udd04 Introduction to proof by contradiction; assuming the opposite of the proposition, deriving a contradiction, and concluding that the proposition is true. 03:01 \ud83e\udd14 Steps for a proof by contradiction: Assume proposition P is false, use the assumption to derive a falsehood, leading to the conclusion that P is true. 04:45 \u2797 Proof by contradiction example: Demonstrating that the square root of 2 is irrational using indirect reasoning. 09:55 \ud83d\udcda Historical context: The proof that the square root of 2 is irrational was discovered by the Pythagoreans, leading to challenges to their axioms and the suppression of the result. 13:42 \ud83d\udeab Introduction to false proofs: Highlighting the pitfalls of relying on visual representations and assumptions in proofs. 20:44 \ud83d\udd04 Induction as a powerful proof technique: The course emphasizes the importance of understanding and applying proofs by induction in computer science. 23:33 \ud83c\udfaf Mathematical induction is like a series of dominoes, where proving a base case and the induction step ensures that a property holds for all values. 24:30 \ud83e\uddee Induction proof example: Proving the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n equals n times n plus 1 over 2, using base case and inductive step. 28:46 \ud83d\udd04 In a proof by induction, you establish a predicate (p) representing the property you want to prove, check the base case, and show the inductive step. 34:41 \ud83d\uded1 Proof by induction doesn't necessarily provide an intuitive understanding of why a theorem is true; it's more about establishing the truth of a statement. 36:35 \u2797 Induction example: Proving that for all natural numbers n, 3 divides n cubed minus n, using base case and inductive step. 43:25 \u274c False proof by induction: Attempting to prove that all horses are the same color, revealing the importance of correctly formulating the induction hypothesis. 51:20 \ud83d\udc34 Inductive proof using \"pn\" to show all horses in a set of n are the same color, addressing a mistake in the proof for n=1. 55:35 \ud83e\udd14 Careful use of the \"dot, dot, dot\" notation in mathematical proofs, highlighting a flaw in the case n=1 of the horse color proof. 56:30 \ud83e\udde9 Importance of proving all steps in an inductive proof, emphasizing the missing link in the proof chain (p1 implies p2) for horse color. 59:21 \ud83e\udde0 Application of mathematical induction to prove the existence of a solution and find the solution for a courtyard tiling problem. 01:03:07 \ud83e\udde9 Definition of the induction hypothesis (\"pn\") in the context of proving the tiling of a courtyard with a center square missing. 01:08:06 \ud83d\udd04 Iterative refinement of the induction hypothesis to successfully prove the tiling of a 2^n by 2^n region with a corner square missing. 01:13:18 \ud83d\udd04 Iterative refinement of the induction hypothesis by considering proving the problem with Bill in the corner first and then using it as a lemma for the center. 01:14:09 \ud83e\udd14 Discussion on alternative approaches, including dividing the courtyard into 2 by 2 squares, highlighting potential challenges. 01:15:37 \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Stronger induction hypothesis (pn) can simplify the proof, emphasizing the advantage of assuming more inductive power for a more complex problem. 01:16:34 \ud83d\udd04 Application of a stronger pn (any square missing) to prove pn implies pn+1 more easily, showcasing the power of a robust induction hypothesis. 01:18:28 \ud83e\udde0 General rule: If you struggle with induction, try assuming something stronger as your induction hypothesis; a more powerful pn can make proving complex problems easier.

(The failed proof i.e. our P(n) is not helpful.) The induction hypothesis P(n) is that there is an L-tiling possible for a 2^n by 2^n courtyard with Bill in the center. Now, for the inductive step, we assume P(n) is true, and we want to show P(n+1) is true, so we grow the courtyard to 2^(n+1) by 2^(n+1), section it into four quadrants (each 2^n by 2^n) and place an L shape tile (ie. 3 regular tiles in an L shape) dead center in the bigger courtyard such that the L shape tile does not land on the 2^n by 2^n section containing Bill. Now those three Bill-less sections contain 1 piece of the L-shape tile. We know that P(n) is true (because we assumed it), but we P(n) is useless for the three quadrants in question. Why? Well, for each of the 3 sections containing a piece of the L-tile, we place a \"Bill\" in the L-tile it contains. But now \"Bill\" is not in the center of those sections, it is in the corner of those sections. So we can't say anything about tiling them \"with Bill in the center\" because \"Bill\" is not in the center. Our P(n) is not helpful here.  2. (The incomplete proof i.e. our P(n) only gets us so far.) Change P(n) to say that an L-tiling of 2^n by 2^n is possible with B in the corner. Okay, again, we start with a 2^n by 2^n, but now place Bill in the corner, then we look at a 2^(n+1) by 2^(n+1), section it into four 2^n by 2^n, and place the L-tile dead center like before, such that now we have a \"Bill\" in the corner of each 2^n by 2^n section contain the L-tile, and now by our new P(n) we say that each section is L-tile-able. Therefore the whole courtyard is tile-able, so P(n+1) true. By induction, then, P(n) is true (tiling with Bill in the corner). Okay that's nice, but that's not what we want to know in our original problem. We want to know can we tile the courtyard with Bill in the center. We found a way to show that tiling is possible with Bill in the corner, but now we somehow have to use that to prove that a tiling is possible with Bill in the center. The professor says this is possible but it is just more work, and it is more simple to instead make P(n) stronger.   3. (The successful proof i.e. stronger P(n).) Stronger P(n): A tiling is possible with Bill in any square.

For the Induction Axiom to work, there are two requirements.  1. Base case must be true  - P(1) is trivially true, because the 1 horse will always be the same color as itself.  2. P(n) => P(n+1) - So, when we write n horses, we typically write h(1), h(2), h(3) ....h(n) & for n+1 horses h(1), h(2), h(3) ....h(n), h(n+1)  In the above statements, we sub-consciously assume that n is a bigger number greater than 1. Here lies the mistake. Since n can be any number, n can also be 1. So, the list can be:  h(n) -----> for n horses h(n), h(n+1) -----> for n+1 horses  More specifically: h(1) -----> for n horses, where n being 1 h(1), h(2) -----> for n+1 horses, where n being 1  Now, as per inductive step, predicate is assumed to be true.  Assumption: Set of any n horses is of the same color. => h(1) is the same color as itself, say color c1 The assumption also implies that h(2) is the same color of itself, say color c2 Now does h(1) => h(2)? i.e. does c1 = c2? We can't determine that, can we? There is no way we say c1 is always same as c2. So, the inductive step breaks.

To elaborate on the horses example: it just provided insight in how sets of countables are handled within inductive reasoning. If you have one of something, the 'P(1)' case can be true if the proposition you make refers to a property of an item in your set, so long as that first item has said property. It just shows that you have to be careful with sets of one. In such a case, it is wise to eliminate that as an option to work off of, so you go to 'P(2)' as base case.

Since the first factor is divisible by three, and 3 is divisible by three, we have that 4^(n+1)-1 is divisible by three.
