Why is proved with the series of 1/2^n and not with that of 1/n if both sequences tends to 0 ? Ok series 1/2^n is convergent and our harmonic divergent, but if Zeno asked for 1/2, 1/3 ,1/4, 1/5 ,...,1/n to the destination, this divergent is  one case Against the other convergent used to proof of movement. Is not a \"math cheat\" choose one sequence convenient to the proof without explain why others are not valid AGAINST that choosen? If the answer is only :\"divergent is infinite sum\" this gives reason to Zeno, as he have one valid infinite sum against that convergent proof. Who wins? I think have math answer to this, but post my initial fair though. PS: i see in the convergent as in each step summing 1/2^n to the acquired also remains 1/2^n to destination, as in the harmonic summing 1/n to the acquired remains (1-1/n) to destination.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Jtnxi9uM7yA", "cid": "Ugw5aJjU2Tf5rrFgMNx4AaABAg", "comment": "Please come teach at my university...they make these things seem so abstract while they are in fact very intuitive", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "Jtnxi9uM7yA", "cid": "UgzILUaIsvi2IrSQvpZ4AaABAg", "comment": "Teacher: -you have 24h to prepare for this topic.
