This part of the protein is known as the homeobox domain (or just homeodomain). \r \r The importance of the homeodomain is that this is the part of a protein that can interact directly with DNA (or RNA). So, proteins that contain a homeodomain can act as transcription factors. Equivalently, genes that contain a homeobox sequence can be regulatory genes. \r \r Hox genes are simply one group of genes that contain a homeobox sequence, and which are very important in body plan development.

Ok first of all, there is a concept known as 'Free Will' - In which we as people can make our own mistakes to which we will be held accountable for. God's not an over-reaching Dictator who controls every aspect of life as you seem to be under the impression of.\u00a0  And once again you seem to be missing my point. I am not saying that I am 'Special' and that my beliefs are more important, as i have mentioned before. I am just stating that you have your beliefs and i have mine. I do not see the point in attacking your beliefs to feel self-righteous in my own and would politely ask you to agree to disagree. Attacking a stranger just for these reasons to me feels a little absurd.\u00a0  You are repeating yourself... Yes, i did put my opinion out to the public, but if i had said the same thing openly face to face - would you respond in such a demeaning and insulting manor? i highly doubt it. a simple \"I disagree\" would have sufficed. You may present your point, but there is a thing called tact which you may wish to employ if you wish to give your opinion on the subject. More people are likely to listen if you do not spew insults to their personal beliefs, and frankly i found that you are taking a rather narrow view of the subject matter - focusing solely on the bad when there is good to be found. This is why i was calling you Pessimistic. A realist would look at the overarching picture, not just the bad.\u00a0  And yes, i agree. You do need to converse to prevent Wars but what i am saying is that spewing why your beliefs are superior and that everyone should think as you do without seriously considering their own views is one of the reasons Wars come about. Such conversations need to find a balance in which both sides come out somewhat satisfied by not oppressing one another as you appear to be attempting to do. I acknowledge that you are trying, but the way you go about it does need some improvement.  Many muslims do not agree with ISIS, and i feel you are in fact stereotyping when it comes to Religion. It is often the minority that are the very visible Extremists, and the vast majority do believe that extremists interpret the scriptures wrongly. The difficulty is in the fact that over the years Religious scripts are translated over and over, with Authorities of the time adding and subtracting parts to influence the majority - I can name one part of the Bible which was added on at at later date off of the top of my head.\u00a0  But nether the less, what i am trying to is that scripts such as the Bible can not be taken Literally as they are heavily influenced by the society of the time they are written and re-written. This is the entire reason why there are so many groups and sub-groups even within a religion as though they may follow the same text, they interpret them in vastly different ways which may not hold up to the original beliefs as they were written.\u00a0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjgEefRr6gBCngCoAEC.85NzyaFWaAg7-LrQ5_yID_", "comment": "... sigh you appear to not understand what I was saying... at all... or are purposely misinterpreting me. either way, i find your arguments are becoming repetitive as I have tried to calmly explain my view but never-the-less.\u00a0  I stated that \"Such conversations need to find a balance in which both sides come out somewhat satisfied by not oppressing one another\". That does not mean I believe that people should not express their views or disagree with others, but that people should politely give their arguments in a balanced fashion so that neither side is oppressed nor forced into agreeing with something that goes against their beliefs nor are they forced to adopt beliefs in which they do not believe. In that sense i find you are acting as bad as those you are accusing as you are attempting to force your own beliefs on to me when barely considering my own opinion - only that you believe it is 'false' and that i cannot be allowed to form my own views based on my own experience.  And your comment of tact leaves me to believe you are lashing out at the fact I am criticizing your own methods, which might I add you state that \"I care about my own ideas, and whether they're harmful or not. and \u00a0\"I want my ideas to be scrutinised and attacked. For people to be free to point out flaws when they see them, so that I can better myself\". So i feel that you are somewhat contradicting yourself by saying \"Lack of tact hurts your feelings, and it doesn't feel nice when people scrutinise your ideas publicly. Well, you deserve no sympathy here.\" as I was simply pointing out the flaws in the delivery of your argument so I am not entirely sure why you have focused on this in your response.\u00a0  I am not offended by your differing view, I am just attempting to explain my own.  I never said a human cannot do good on their own. to believe that would completely counteract my beliefs as that would be like saying \u00a0\"A non-Christian cannot do good in the world\" when there are many examples of that phrase being wrong.\u00a0 Religious texts are usually a mix of History, God's commands and his involvement with humanity and prophecies. As humanity is flawed, the view of those writing the bible and re-writing it may be somewhat skewered by their own beliefs and views. There are several books in the New Testament which Re-tell a parts of Jesus' story from the view or perspective of different disciples, each including or not including different parts and focusing on different aspects of the story. Therefore technically God did not write the book (in fact The only text he has written down for us are the 10 Commandments in which he gave to Moses and are still relevant today).

Bear in mind, that the human brain is OFTEN compared to a computer, but it does not function like a computer at all.  Sure, I would agree that computers need to be perfectly wired, and things like the motherboard of a computer has to have the paths mathematically perfect so as to optimize efficiency, but the fatal flaw in the analogy is that it overlooks a very obvious point, the brain does not function like a computer at all.   The analogy seems to imply that for a brain to function, it must be wired with such mathematical precision, but it isn't!  How can you tell a perfectly wired brain from an imperfectly wired one?   Since you confirm that brains are made of neurons, that means by definition that the cell is easily excited by electricity, and said electricity excites the cells to transport stimuli through electrical and chemical means.   You need an action potential for a neuron to do anything, and all lines of evidence point to action potentials existing in single-cell eukaryotes LONG BEFORE they existed in multi-cellular organisms.  That's the thing about irreducible complexity, there is no such thing as a biological example of irreducible complexity.  All we have to demonstrate about the seemingly complex way neurons work is one example of a cell that has the base functionality of how a neuron works, and single-celled organisms have action potentials powered by calcium, rather than by sodium.  The rest can be explained by descent with modification.   In fact, this VERY TOPIC of how neurons evolved is a common subject in any neurobiology class, and is frequently referenced in modern neurobiology textbooks, where they explain the chemistry, biology, and origins of neurons.  I would suggest you get caught up, here's a neurobiology textbook that covers the very subject: Neurobiology: Molecules, Cells, and Systems by Gary G. Matthews.   Also, this paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26646567, addresses the physiology of neurons and how they apply to higher cognitive thought.  What you fail to realize is that you're bringing forth modern organisms and arguing that taking a function from them is detrimental.  Who argues that brains had to be as complex as the ones before it.  In fact, if we look at the human brain structure, it doesn't differ much from apes or other primates, and a lot of the structures evolved atop already working structures.  The brain stem is anatomically analogous to the fish brain, the brain stem plus the hypothalamus, and the rest of the mid-brain, is anatomically analogous to a reptile or bird brain, and the cerebrum plus the cerebellum is anatomically analogous to a typical primate brain.  So while the paper and book I have provided delve deep into how the neurons evolved, and how consequently the brain evolved, we have to look at fossil evidence too, and fossil evidence clearly gives us a picture of the brain's evolution, indicating that subsequent structures are compiled atop already working structures.   \"Glial cells number around 300 billion, each needing 'plans' that need to be followed for their attachments and interconnections, just like neurons do.\"   --This paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21584869 addresses the subject on the origins of glial cells.  Again, every example you will bring of what looks like irreducible complexity already has a scientific explanation.   \"There must be billions of capillaries that bring oxygenated blood to these 400 billion cells.\"   --Roughly 10 billion actually.  And evolution of circulatory systems is already well documented.  Nobody argues that we had open circulatory systems for billions of years until another organism appeared with a closed circulatory system.  Rather, closed circulatory systems likely evolved from gastrovascular cavities, which is a cavity in which circulation and digestion can occur.  Believe it or not, we humans are the very definitions of what a coelomate is, that is a bi-laterally symmetrical animal with a digestive tract, and you know what else belongs in that group?  Flatworms, which surprise, have a gastrovascular cavity.  The likely scenario is that digestive and closed circulatory systems evolved from gastrovascular cavities together.  When you explore the evolution of the circulatory system, you also explore the evolution of the digestive system because at one point they were the same thing.   \"There are only 64 million coded base pairs in our DNA.\"   --Yet humans are made of 98.8% of DNA that doesn't code for anything.  And curiously, these non coding genes can be traced through fossils, evo-devo, anatomy, as being genetic vestiges from our ancestors.   One of these types of non coding genes are ERV's, which occur when a virus infects the germ cells.  Humans and chimps have DNA that is 98% identical, and curiously, a good bulk of those similarities come from ERV's.  This cannot, mathematically, be a coincidence, because to share even ONE ERV in the exact same insertion points would be an astronomically small occurrence if they were intelligently designed, to say nothing of the thousands they share in the exact same locations.  However, if both shared a common ancestor that had these ERV's already, the chances of both humans and chimps sharing almost all of their ERV's in the same insertion points would be a near certainty.   No creationist can explain this, and to date, no one has even attempted.   If we were intelligently designed, why WOULD we share 98% of our DNA with chimps?  Why SHOULD we have the same ERV's in the same insertion points?  The fact remains that we weren't intelligently designed or created, we humans are nothing more than modified apes.  In fact, the only reason our brain size increased in comparison to the other apes, is the deletion of a homeobox gene called PAX 9 which is INACTIVE in humans, and active in gorillas.  PAX 9 is a gene that reduces risk of cancer, yet this gene is switched off in humans, allowing our brains to grow at the expense of being more at risk at developing brain cancer.    Why SHOULD this be the case if humans were intelligently designed?  Again, we weren't, we are nothing more than modified versions of our ancestors, which just so happened to be apes.   \"The brain alone mathematically knocks out DNA from being the holder of the blueprints for the human body. I like your presentation, but the numbers don't lie. Do they?\"   --Statistically, the brain forming in humans is a direct consequence if descending from previous ancestors who also had brains.  But even if this particular claim is true, which isn't even true as the heart forms BEFORE the brain does, it still doesn't explain the other lines of evidence I have just shown you.   You make very WILD claims on what we should expect to see if evolution were true, yet those predictions consequently come from intelligent design, not evolution.   By definition, evolution only operates with seemingly superficial changes that are inherited by their ancestors, and eventually they form breeds of the same species, until they become so genetically distant that they cannot reproduce with offspring, the very definition of speciation.   So really, new species are nothing more than modified versions of whatever their ancestors happened to be.  We happen to descend from primates, and we are nothing more than primates, just like iguanas are just modified lizards.  You are a primate for the same reason that a wolf is a dog, that a lion is a cat, that geckos are lizards, and that birds are nothing more than modified dinosaurs.   All of these claims are indicated in the various lines of evidence, and all point to the same conclusion.   What you need to provide is an explanation that the brain's complexity undermines how it develops in embryology, and in its evolutionary paths, because one of the predictions of embryology is that an organisms' development mirrors its evolutionary line.  Humans are deuterostomes which are animals that develop the orifice for the anus before the one for the mouth, and this was indicated in embryology.

Without an action potential, a neuron is not a neuron by definition.

Most neurobiologists accept that neurons evolved from single cell eukaryotes that had action potentials powered by calcium rather than by sodium.  \"Physiological approaches to understanding molecular actions on dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons underlying higher cognitive processing.

And you also ignored my point that brains don't function like computers in the least.  One reason is that neurons respond to sensory stimuli, computers require user input and programming.  So my question stands, how can you tell the difference between an improperly wired brain versus a properly wired one?  \"Your article about the evolution of glial cells admits it has no idea how that took place: \"The evolutionary origins of glia are lost in time, as soft tissues rarely leave behind fossil footprints, and any molecular footprints they might have been left we have yet to decipher.'' Your citings are a complete fail.\"  --This is a textbook example of a quote mine. \u00a0The abstract goes on to say: \"Nevertheless, because of the growing realization of the importance glia plays in the development and functioning of the nervous system, lessons we can draw about commonalities among different taxa (including vertebrates) brought about either from a common origin, or from common adaptational pressures, shed light on the roles glia play in all nervous systems. The Acoelomorpha, primitive interstitial flatworms with very simple cellular organization and currently at the base of the bilaterian phylogeny, possess glia-like cells. If they indeed represent the ancestors of all other Bilateria, then it is possible that all glias derive from a common ancestor. However, basal taxa lacking convincing glia are found in most major phyletic lines: urochordates, hemichordates, bryozoans, rotifers, and basal platyhelminths. With deep phylogenies currently in flux, it is equally possible that glia in several lines had different origins. If developmental patterns are any indication, glia evolved from ectodermal cells, possibly from a mobile lineage, and even possibly independently in different regions of the body. As to what functions might have brought about the evolution of glia, by-product removal, structural support, phagocytic needs, developmental programming, and circuit modulation may be the more likely. Explaining possible cases of glial loss is more difficult, as once evolved, glia appears to keep inventing new functions, giving it continued value even after the original generative need becomes obsolete. Among all the uncertainties regarding the origin of glia, one thing is certain: that our ideas about those origins will change with every rearrangement in deep phylogeny and with continued advances in invertebrate molecular and developmental areas.\"  This is scientific speak, wherein scientists avoid using absolute statements, because scientists' explanations have to be falsifiable, so by necessity, they avoid absolute statements. \u00a0While they admit while the actual origin of glial cells is a little fuzzy, they go on to explain how glial cells evolved in many different lines in taxonomy.  Maybe actually read the sources I provide you?  My sources aren't a complete fail, it's your reading comprehension that is lacking.  \"The evolution of any closed system, be it blood vessels or digestive tracts is not possible, as there is no stepwise assembly possible.\"  --And what is your source for this claim?  And there is a way that closed systems evolved, like I explained earlier, closed circulatory systems evolved from gastrovascular cavities, which are closed cavities where digestion and circulation happen simultaneously.  Since humans by definition belong to the clade Coelemata, that means they are bi-laterally symmetrical animals that have a gastrointestinal tract.  I also explained that another animal group belongs to that clade, the flatworms, which have gastrovascular cavities.  \"The system is useless until it is closed, which obviously takes intelligence.\"  --You're arguing irreducible complexity, which logically is an argument from personal incredulity.  Gastrovascular cavities are the likely origin of digestive systems and circulatory systems.  As I've explained earlier, there is no biological example that's irreducibly complex.  You're taking highly adapted organisms and trying to argue that taking away an adaptation from a modern organism means that organism will fail.  Nobody argues that a complex system poofed out of nowhere, which is literally what you're arguing for.  Rather, we argue that highly adapted systems, like the cardiovascular and digestive systems have their origins in gastrovascular cavities.  Until you provide a peer-reviewed source that highly adapted systems require a god to make them, and until you provide evidence that indicates that conclusion exclusively, your argument is moot.  You just say it's impossible without understanding what the evidence says, and not citing any sources or providing any evidence for your claim.  You might as well argue that the Sun doesn't go around the Earth because the argument holds the same weight.  \"You're kidding. Right? \"The rest\"? You place an immense amount of living nature into a couple of words...\"the rest\". You try to slough off an infinite amount of needed explanation with this absurd statement.\"  --I might have had a too high of an opinion of you. \u00a0Do you want me to explain in detail and summarize an entire field of study just to satisfy your question that has already been answered? \u00a0Because I will gladly do so.  And you took the quote out of context yet AGAIN, which is really your only argumentative tactic.  In my original quote I explained the likely source of neurons, that they evolved from single-celled eukaryotes that had an action potential that was powered by calcium rather than by sodium.  As evolution works with small incremental steps over a period of time, each addition to that template will accumulate.  Which is why that irreducible complexity as applied to biology doesn't work, because each adaptation was built upon an already working structures.  Single celled eukaryotes have action potentials already, and each addition to that structure to improve its functionality or efficiency will eventually yield a cell that's excited by electrical impulses, the very definition of what a neuron is.  And since neurons are HIGHLY adapted cells, their developmental stages were built upon template cells that were more adaptable, or not as adapted.  I thought you would understand how such a basic concept works, but apparently that was expecting too much.  \"It's like saying \"we can get to Andromeda with a rocket ship\". The trip to Andromeda isn't possible, neither is your explanation for \"the rest\".\"  --You make this claim without citing any sources or evidence at all.  I've just explained it, and there's a WHOLE ENTIRE FIELD OF STUDY that's just devoted to neurons, their physiology, how they work via chemistry, and, of course, how they evolved. \u00a0It's called NEUROBIOLOGY.  I suggest you take a neurobiology class which has in depth explanations of my general summary.  I will agree that taking a modern neuron and taking away one of its adaptations will make for an ineffective neuron, but I will disagree that neurons can't have evolved, because they evidently did.  \"You accept the fact that DNA has only 64 million base pairs, and 21.3 million codons.\"  --And of those 64 million base pairs for the human genome, 98.8% of it doesn't code for anything.  \"The brain's 100 billion neurons, 300 billion glial cells, and billions of capillaries completely overwhelm the human genetic system.\"  --Where's your source for this laughable claim?  Because each organ, each capillary, each neuron, everything that makes up the human body comes from DNA and how it's synthesized into proteins.  Is genetics really that hard of a concept to grasp for you?  It is a known biochemical fact that cells and organs are built from DNA and how it's synthesized.  In fact, we already know what DNA codes for, and it's a simple fact most people learned in a basic biology class.  DNA codes for amino acids, and amino acids form chains which is the basis for what makes organelles, what makes cells, what make tissues, what make organs, and what make organ systems.  This BASIC biology, and yet for some reason you don't understand it.  If the brain is made up of neurons, and neurons are cells by definition, it means they undergo DNA synthesis. \u00a0  If you can't be bothered to understand basic biology, I shouldn't be surprised that you're baffled by the evolution of cells, which is more complicated.  \"Which means gradual mutational changes in DNA has nothing to do with the formation/evolution of the human brain.\"  --Yes it does, you contradicted yourself. \u00a0Evolution is variation in the genetic code by definition.  And specifically the evolution of nervous systems, and consequently, neurons are explained by neurobiology, which, again, is the field that studies the physiology of these cells, their chemistry, their biochemistry, and how they evolved from previous cells.  And since you already admitted that changes in the genetic code happens, you inadvertently admitted that evolution happens.  And the evolution of the brain can be easily explained through fossil evidence. \u00a0Evolution of neurons is more complicated, but again, it isn't unknown.  Maybe read that neurobiology textbook I cited for you? \u00a0And just because I feel generous, I'll cite it again for you.\u00a0Neurobiology: Molecules, Cells, and Systems by Gary G. Matthews.  \"Or any other part of the human body. DNA \u00a0holds the coding for proteins, and that's it.\"  --And these amino acids form amino acid chains which are the very foundation that life is based off of.  Here, let me give you a biochemistry textbook that explains this basic concept for you:\u00a0Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Fourth Edition by David L. Nelson  Your contentions have already been falsified, as biochemistry and neurobiology already explains how evolution happens on a chemical level, and how neurons evolved.  \"Which puts evolution in the same category as the ancient gods and fables. It's pure fable.\"  --Argument from personal incredulity. \u00a0Unless you cite the sources of your claims, and/or provide empirical peer-reviewed evidence, your claims hold no weight.  I cited TWO peer-reviewed sources for you, and TWO textbooks which deal with the very subjects you're having a hard time understanding.

Re:\"DNA codes for amino acids, and amino acids form chains which is the basis for what makes organelles, what makes cells, what make tissues, what make organs, and what make organ systems.\"  Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. DNA codes for proteins, and that's it. It doesn't make eyes, bones, muscles, brains, blood vessels, blood.... \u00a0If you want to believe it does, fine with me. No person on Earth knows how neurons first formed, or what holds the plans for the parts of the human body. So your books and citings don't either. Your first citing admits that fact in its first sentence.  Evolution can occur in protein synthesis, which can change characteristics but not organs and bio-systems. Height, weight, skin color, hair color... can evolve. Brains, ball and ball and socket joints, teeth, vision systems cannot evolve from from non-existence through selected mutations. Do the math: \u00a022.3 million codons can't hold the plans for 10 billion neurons and their septillion connections, and their 300 billion glial cells, and the their billions of capillaries, and...The brain ALONE trumps mutations and genetic evolution of the human body. \u00a0 Your evo-fable ran out of ammo long ago.

Single cell eukaryotes are eukaryotic cells, meaning that by definition they have a nucleus, and they have an action potential, which means that stimuli has to reach a certain threshold before the cell does anything.  Several cells in the human body have them, like for example, muscle cells, neurons, and endocrine cells.  Between eukaryotes there is two ways that action potentials are generated, either by sodium, or by calcium.  And since the progenitor cells of neurons had action potentials, it isn't too big of a stretch to deduce their descendants have them too.  \"Citing cells that you or any human think evolved into neurons is worthless drivel.\"  --Except numerous single celled eukaryotes of the kind I described exist in nature like\u00a0ciliate protozoan Paramecium,\u00a0predatory Euglena, and green alga Chlamydomonas.  Of these three modest examples, the latter two have an eye apparatus or \"proto-eye\" if you will that commands their flagellum.  If such basic structures exist in nature now, it's not too big of a stretch of the imagination to deduce that they existed in the past, and at some point, evolved into neurons in animals specifically.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2649305/  This source explains in detail on how sensory sensitive cells like neurons evolved.  \"Anyone can cite that anything evolved or turned into anything.\"  --Anyone CAN do that, but would you be willing to admit that to assert as fact that which is not evidently true is dishonest?  Until claims are substantiated with verifiable evidence there is no legitimate reason to believe in a claim.  I've made some claims, with which I have backed up with objective evidence, but you dismiss it all.  You're not on a quest to understand, you're on a quest to deny any and all evidence if it goes against your so-called \"intelligent designer.\"  But I could turn this argument on you and say that anyone can claim something is created by a deity. \u00a0I could name Allah, Buddha, Krishna, Siddartha Guatama, Jesus, or Zeus. \u00a0The list is endless.  Until you can substantiate a claim with demonstrable, verifiable evidence, there is no reason to believe the claim at all.  You haven't ONCE provided anything of merit. \u00a0Therefore, your argument literally has no merit. \u00a0Thus your whole point in debating me is fruitless.  \"Evolution has no idea how any cells formed.\"  --So you earlier claimed that evolution cannot explain the origin of neurons. \u00a0Once I provided you a verifiable and demonstrable explanation, you shifted the goalposts ever so subtly by now saying that evolution doesn't know how any cell, no matter the type came into existence.  Well no shit Sherlock, as that specific conundrum deals with ABIOGENESIS, which isn't related to evolution at all.  Evolution by definition cannot operate where no genomes exist.  And I will even concede that abiogenesis doesn't know EXACTLY how cells came to be, but to say they have no idea is fundamentally ignorant.  No research suggest that RNA, which is the progenitor of DNA, likely came from monomers and polymers that could self replicate.  We know that at a specific pH and temperature, lipids form phospholipid bi-layers automatically upon contact with water.  These self replicating monomers and polymers likely found their way into one of these membranes and passed this on down to their descendants.  Biochemists have also won a Nobel Prize for presenting evidence that RNA can fold itself to make ribosomes.  So likely the first cell was much simpler than you're thinking.  Again, the full picture isn't entirely known, but we shouldn't be intellectually dishonest and claim that nobody has any idea, or that the problem won't be solved by science.  You should look into the Dunning-Kruger Effect. \u00a0No doubt it would be a revelation for you.  \"The modern version is abiogenesis AKA spontaneous generation a long long time ago.\"  --I guess the concept of irony is alien to you? \u00a0Because that's exactly what creationists like you argue for, that life poofed into existence.  I argue that life is nothing more than chemistry, and thus has its origins in complex chemical processes.  Or would you like to define what you think is an adequate definition of \"intelligent design\"?  Because I argue that intelligent design is merely the re-branding of creationism.  \"It's all fable.\"  --So you agree that life poofing into existence from nothing is a fairy tale?  Nice to see that you're inadvertently contradicting yourself.  Again, my viewpoint is that of science, and science suggests that since life is based on chemical processes, it likely has its roots in complicated, multi-step chemical processes.  Again, I agree that spontaneous generation was a stupid assertion, but to obfuscate the two to imply that spontaneous generation IS abiogenesis is fundamentally dishonest.  \"Laughable. \"Easily explained?\" You have been fooled. There isn't even a good fable about how the brain evolved. Words are cheap and easy. Reality is tough.\"  --The origin of the brain itself is closely tied with the origin of neurons, and thus this is an entire field of study collectively called neurobiology.  Neuobiology, as I have already explained to you before, deals with the physiology, chemical/biochemical processes, and origins of the nervous system.  And again, I cited you a neurobiology textbook that deals with this matter that seems to have you baffled as all hell.  Let me cite it AGAIN for you, and additional neurobiology textbooks which has the answers you're seeking:\u00a0  *Development of the Nervous System, Third Edition by Dan H. Sanes  *Neurobiology: Molecules, Cells, and Systems by Gary G. Matthews  *A Brain Is Born: Exploring the Birth and Development of the Central Nervous System by John E. Upledger.  Not only do we have evo-devo that backs up this evidence, we also have embryology that backs up this evidence, and we even have fossil evidence that give us a clue as to how the brain likely evolved.  You claim there isn't a good explanation for the origin and evolution of the brain, but I just gave you THREE neurobiology textbooks that explain, in detail, of how the brain evolved, and the brain's evolution is closely tied with the evolution of neurons, so you've got a triple whammy here.  Are you now willing to admit that your claim that science doesn't have an adequate explanation for the origin of the nervous system was dishonest?  And would you agree that it is dishonest to assert as fact that which is not evidently true?  \"Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. DNA codes for proteins, and that's it.\"  --On the contrary, as it is YOU that doesn't have the faintest fucking clue of what you're talking about.  You claim that DNA only codes for proteins, which is correct, but as anybody who passed a basic biology course will tell you, it codes for AMINO ACIDS, and AMINO ACIDS form chemical chains on which the structures that sustain life are needed.  Or is the concept of DNA and RNA synthesis alien to you?  We already KNOW what DNA codes for, and errors in the replication of DNA lead to genetic diseases like sickle cell.  Again, if you can't be bothered to understand such a simple and easily demonstrable fact that DNA codes for amino acids, and that amino acids form chains on which the processes and structures that sustain life are based, which is literally so easily demonstrable that it is LITERALLY the basis of biology and biochemistry, then you will not understand how the fuck neurons work, anatomy & physiology, or neurobiology.  Have you even taken a biology class? \u00a0Because this is taught in fucking grade school!  And for some reason you think that the scientists are idiots. \u00a0How arrogant of you.  \"It doesn't make eyes, bones, muscles, brains, blood vessels, blood....\"  --This is, quite honestly, one of the dumbest things I've ever read.  If you're willing to be this fucking ignorant, then there's no more debate to be had with you, because your inability to understand scientific processes is NOT an argument against them.  Until you start making intelligent arguments, and until you learn and understand 5th grade biology, I have nothing more to say to you.  Your inability to understand scientific concepts on even a basic level is NOT an argument against them.  You don't understand the basics of biology, which means you will not understand more complicated biology like neurobiology, anatomy & physiology, biochemistry, embryology, zoology, and taxonomy.  So maybe instead of highlighting your idiocy more, why not try to understand biology? \u00a0At least make an attempt, because replies like these only show me that you're not on a quest to understand. \u00a0  And since you're not on a quest to understand, and since you're literally the very definition of unreasonable, I see no more point in engaging in a debate with you. \u00a0  You don't have any grasp on the basics of the subject, yet you argue against demonstrable science because at the heart of it all, you don't understand the process.  You cannot learn anything new until you're willing to be more reasonable. \u00a0Until you have a basic grasp on the subject at hand, and until you're more reasonable, I will not engage in anymore debate with you.

He has the power to exterminate all mankind, he can do all sorts of fancy magic tricks that is beyond the imagination of mankind in a matter of nanoseconds, he has a list of things he does not want you to do and above all, he loves you. He loves you and he demands you to worship him in your entire lifetime. You see, this is how the Roman Empire became a huge success(sort of) in the first place. Because there was this thing called religion, nobody dared to stage an uprising since God forbade it. They all thought that the corrupt Roman leaders would have to answer to God in the future and this allowed those corrupt assholes to become fatter and richer while feeding off the poor. In fact, religion has been used as a tool to boost the power and monarch of kings and queens for thousands of years already. And let's face it; this is exactly why religion was created in the first place. Meanwhile in the Middle East that existed in the previous generation, the Egyptians and Libyans and the other ME countries never dared to rebel against their corrupt government until now because of this thing called religion! Don't forget, these governments have already claimed to have the blessing of Allah and Allah forbids uprisings according to the Quran. In fact, religion nullifies your rights. All religions clearly state that God has every right to do what he wants because everything he does has a reason behind it. It doesn't matter if it's the Bible or the Quran or even the Veda. They're all the same in this particular aspect. And guess what? You're not allowed to question their actions. You're not even allowed to doubt their intentions.

First off, why would life need to exist if doesn't exist already. Now yes, of course a bolt of lightning\u00a0could have struck a pool of liquid that contained all of the necessary elements for life to arise, and create a cell. Now this is all\u00a0is fine and dandy for this little cell, but the cell can't do anything. The information for it to reproduce, metabolize, and even simply function as a unit is stored in DNA. If you break it down even further, the formation of a simple protein, which basically regulates most of the body's processes, is incredibly complex, and is created by proteins. Basically all the information of proteins was created by a protein. This leads me to my\u00a0final conclusion. There\u00a0had to be some driving force, some kick in the but that started this whole machine of life. What was this driving force? What kicked life in the but? Now, of course it couldn't have been a lightning bolt, as lightning bolts can not tell the cell how to make proteins, or how to code DNA, or how to regulate your body temperature to the degree. Something or SOMEONE, had to give this original set of information that told the cell how to form proteins, and later an entire organism. This is where God comes in.

Like modern gymnosperms, the ovule exuded droplets of sap to catch pollen grains. \u00a0Insects (beetles) on the plant found this protein/sugar mix and used it as food.\u00a0Insects became dependent on this food source and started carrying pollen from plant to plant.\u00a0Beetle-pollination must have been more efficient than wind for some species, so there was natural selection for plants that attracted insects.\u00a0Next to occur would have been the evolution of nectaries, nectar-secreting structures, to lure the pollinators.\u00a0Development of white or brightly-colored, conspicuous flowers to draw attention to the nectar and/or other food sources would also have occurred.\u00a0The carpel (female reproductive structure) was originally leaf-shaped. It became folded on itself to enclose and protect the ovule from being eaten by the pollinators (hence Angiosperms). Plants with protected ovules would have been selected over ones with ovules that got eaten because the ones that got eaten could not have offspring.\u00a0By the beginning of the Cenozoic Era (65 mya), the first bees, wasps, butterflies, and moths had evolved.

It's mathematically impossible to have these millions of species today, if we had only a few thousands of it 4,000 years ago. Because that would means / equals to the appearance of 11+ new species everyday since 4,000 years. Every single day. And it would be a process that would keep going, but it doesn't, this is not what we observe and observed through time.  This is not evolution. This is not even \"evolution could be possible that way\", it simply doesn't work. Plus this is not how evolution work, this is not what we observe and observed through time. And I'm not even talking about the inbreeding and the extinction of species because of the lack of DNA variety within that species.  Dogs are indeed the product of evolution, controlled breeding (a.k.a artificial selection, which is like the natural selection that determine the evolution of a species, except that this pressure is applied by men), from wolves, but it took much longer than 4,000 years of domestication.

Because there was this thing called religion, nobody dared to stage an uprising since God forbade it. They all thought that the corrupt Roman leaders would have to answer to God in the future and this allowed those corrupt assholes to become fatter and richer while feeding off the poor. In fact, religion has been used as a tool to boost the power and monarch of kings and queens for thousands of years already. And let's face it; this is exactly why religion was created in the first place. Meanwhile in the Middle East that existed in the previous generation, the Egyptians and Libyans and the other ME countries never dared to rebel against their corrupt government until now because of this thing called religion! Don't forget, these governments have already claimed to have the blessing of Allah and Allah forbids uprisings according to the Quran. In fact, religion nullifies your rights. All religions clearly state that God has every right to do what he wants because everything he does has a reason behind it. It doesn't matter if it's the Bible or the Quran or even the Veda.

Genetic mutations (especially the \"good guy\" ones that are incredibly freakin' rare) accumulate over a long time, so an organism - or, should I say, a species - acquires feathers over a few hundred million years.

The feathers stay because either a) they proved to be a definite advantage for the organisms that possessed them\u00a0 and, thus, are naturally selected and passed down through the generations, or b) they were never selected against. Like, they were there, but no one ever made a big deal out of them, so the gene coding for them just kinda stuck around in the population. (kinda like human males having nipples - they don't serve an evolutionary purpose, but neither are they a detriment to survival, so men just develop them and no one thinks anything different of it).  Gradually, environmental stresses may have favoured the extensive development of feathers into wings the likes of which we see in modern birds, coupled with other mutations and adaptions in the population to produce the little feathery scumbags that sit on your back fence and sing at, like, five in the morning. The important thing to remember is that a species as a whole doesn't spontaneously just sprout feathers. The gene coding for it may or may not be dispersed through the population over time depending on whether or not it's favourable in terms of ensuring the organism's survival.  So, realistically, the dinobird wouldn't have been running around with one wing and one dino arm. It would have had dino arms coated in feathers; feathers that its species acquired veeery gradually as the gene coding for 'feathers' dispersed to affect the entire population.

Instead, the \u201claw of biogenesis\u201d is an inductive conclusion. The basic logic is as follows: \"Every X studied so far has Y, therefore, all X's have Y.\"  In inductive reasoning, the conclusion cannot be considered reliable.\u00a0 The conclusion is consistent with the premises, but it does not necessarily follow from them.\u00a0 Inductive conclusions must be considered tentative, not absolute. The history of science if full of inductive conclusions that later turned out to be wrong. As one example, all the wide variety of cells that had been studied up to a certain point in time used the same genetic code, so it was concluded that it was the UNIVERSAL genetic code, used by all organisms everywhere. But later a few exceptions were found.  2) The so-called \"law of biogenesis\" is an inductive conclusion based on studies of modern cells, and the first living entity would not have been a modern cell or anything like a modern cell.  So even if for the sake of argument we were to accept that the so-called \"law of biogenesis\" is 100% absolute, it still wouldn't apply to the origin of life since the \"law\" was derived from studies of modern cells, which are not what would have been involved in the origin of life.  For example, in one model with some scientific support, the first \"cells\" (protocells):  a. would not have had any genetically encoded proteins (unlike even the simplest extant cell, which has several hundred genetically encoded proteins)  b. would have had a membrane made of fatty acids (unlike all extant cells, which have a membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer \u2013 with proteins embedded in it)  c. would have stored its genetic information using RNA (not DNA, as all extant cells use to store their genetic information)  d. would have copied its genetic information using catalytic RNA molecules (not proteins, as all extant cells use to copy their genetic information)  e. would have had only 1 or a handful of genes (unlike even the simplest extant cell, which has several hundred genes).  The studies from which the so-called \"law of biogenesis\" was derived did not deal with anything like the above protocells, so their findings cannot be taken to apply to such protocells.", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjQO892MXyDjngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ea6r73jOHr9aw6U", "comment": "DNAunion\u00a0Genes are instructional codes, and it takes a processing unit (cell) to read and produce what's on the codes.\u00a0 Let me know when instructional codes and computerized cells can randomly create and encode themselves.\u00a0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjQO892MXyDjngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ea6r73jh6Ern-nq", "comment": "ArcaneTruth (theghost) Wrong, Arcane.\u00a0 There is no code in DNA.\u00a0 But hey, feel free to show me the symbols in DNA.\u00a0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjQO892MXyDjngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ea6r73jslZffyh-", "comment": "DNAunion\u00a0ATCG.\u00a0", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjQO892MXyDjngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ea6r758hvQYwnA-", "comment": "ArcanE LogoS (theGhost)\u00a0Nope, there are no As, Ts, Cs, or Gs in DNA, dumbass. \u00a0But please, idiot, feel fee to show me a G in DNA.\u00a0", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjQO892MXyDjngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ea6r75ABnG1DbOi", "comment": "DNAunion http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/g/genetic_code.htm I will pray that you can comprehend this science one day.", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "reply": true}, {"vid": "9sjwlxQ_6LI", "cid": "UgjQO892MXyDjngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Ea6r75roee_9DaC", "comment": "DNAunion Don't be pedantic.
