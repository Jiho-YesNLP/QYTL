Answering this question is crucial for solving equations for every right-hand side. 31:40 \u274c If matrix columns lie in the same plane, the matrix is singular, and not all right-hand sides have solutions. 33:32 \ud83c\udf0c Understanding linear combinations of vectors in higher dimensions is essential for grasping linear algebra concepts. 35:45 \ud83d\udd04 Matrix form of equations, A*x=b, highlights the importance of matrix-vector multiplication, viewing it as combinations of matrix columns.

What do you think happens to someone after they die?\r 2. Do you think there is an afterlife? \r 3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? \r 4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?\r  \r No one is good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness: \r  \r 1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? \r 2. Have you ever stolen? \r 3. Have you ever used God's name in vain?\r 4. Jesus said that \"whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart\" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? \r 5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? \r 6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?\r  \r The Bible says that \"all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone\" (Revelation 21:8) and \"Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people \u2014 none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God\" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell? \r  \r 2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus\u2019 death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. \r  \r What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, \u201cNo one is good \u2014 except God alone\u201d (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. \r  \r When are you going to do that?\r  \r Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "J7DzL2_Na80", "cid": "UgzJdFgkpX7hMaKUSR94AaABAg", "comment": "This instructor makes the subject over-complicated by burying the student in unnecessary details. The solution of the 2X2 example can be found in 3 to 5 minutes. The 3X3 example will take a little longer, but maybe the instructor needs to dazzle the students to justify making the class longer. Take the first equation:                                     2x    - y = 0 Add the second equation multiplied by 2:    -2x + 4y = 6 Add them together:                                            0x + 3y = 6  dividing by 3, we get y = 2. Inserting the value of y into the first equation:  2x  -2 = 0  and add 2 to both sides we get:  2x = 2                                                                                                                                                             or  x = 1 For the second equation:                                    -x + 2y = 3, so:   -x + 2(2) = 3  or   -x + 4 = 3    Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:                                                                      -x = -4 + 3  or -x = -1 So,                                                                                                                                      x = 1 Final solution:  y = 2, x = 1.

The row picture is probably what your school math teacher taught you. This just confused me a lot. I don't like dot products, but the \"combinations of columns\" is very intuitive once you can visualize why it works.
