You said that only two electrons can occupy the same orbital due two Coulomb repulsion but it's the Pauli-Principle that prevents that from happening. It's a statistical \"force\" that prohibits two electrons to occupy the same quantumstate. Exchange symmetry of the wavefunction requires that all electrons are in different states. Two electrons in the same orbital (n,l,m) must have opposite Spin, because otherwise both electrons would be in the same State n,l,ms", "votes": "12", "replies": "", "reply": false}, {"vid": "hPCO55IJqr8", "cid": "UgxlqZQcTsxOGnm18IF4AaABAg", "comment": "The general chemistry section is not yet finished and after I finish organic, I will redo most of the videos and finish the rest.
