Temperature cannot be Vector. Harsni explained pretty well that the increase or decrease in temperature is a change in its intensity/magnitude and not in its direction. To give examples from the video, it works sort of in the same way as mass. When mass changes from, let's say, 40kg to 50kg it increases but that increase has nothing to do with its direction. It doesn't just move up or down, its value is the only number that changes (it doesn't move \"up\" so to speak). Now, if we compare the change in mass to displacement for example, displacement describes the change of position of an object, so you would need to give its distance from the starting point as well as the direction the object moves, making it Vector. Just as you can't describe an increase of mass with direction, you can't describe an increase of temperature with direction.

How much did the the vehicle accelerate from 30mph to 40mph. Vectors use scalars to work.  On the other hand: speed needs one point and compares relative to zero.

They have to be of the same physical quantity or else you end up mixing different values which would result in wrong answers.   For example let's say we have a box on a table. We push the box to the right with a force we'll call F1 and due to friction from the table, there's an opposite smaller force pushing the box to the left, we'll call it F2. Now since these two forces are opposing we would have to subtract the two forces to find the total force applied on the box in which case Ftotal=F1-F2 ( Because F1>F2 the total force will be facing right). Now if we put velocity into the mix we'd have only one vector and it would be pointing to the right (since that's where the box is moving). The velocity cannot be added to the Ftotal since velocity has nothing to do with the force placed on the box but instead its displacement in a certain timeframe. Since these quantities have nothing to do with each other, you would only serve to adding more quantity to the total force which would give you a wrong answer.
