"+chbrules
What ? Government has no business in funding science ? Are you insane ? You are aware that practically all of basic research globally is funded by governments. It has always been and always will be that way. 
The only thing enterprises do is applied research, which (to put it simply) tries to find ways of applying and refining, what has in principle already been discovered by basic research and turn it into usable products and applications that fulfill a need within the society. Without government funding, basic scientific research and thus the real scientific research, as well as progress will practically drop dead immediately.
Or to put it in a way that you might possibly understand: if you want to leave all future scientific progress to the Chinese than that's the way to go by cutting all scientific research funding by the government.
I agree with your idea that the state has some core tasks and shouldn't mess with everything else, but science and education are clearly tasks that need to be taken care of by the state as this can't be done by a market.",1
"I like how you agreed with me, but the went on to just say the exact opposite and project your overly absurd simplistic world view on the whole scope of history. 

For the sake of this argument I will lump myself in with the right. You first say the the right wants NO rules and doesn't want to help anyone? The right is not full of anarchist the last time I checked. They want the rule of law and respect for private property. Is not wanting the Government to steal private property from some to give to others not wanting to help people? Have you considered the results of programs that are designed to help the poor. Has the great war on Poverty been effective? Does the left not also ignore science when it doesn't suit them? Does the left not turn a blind eye to all the corruption and greed their politicians do with big business? Does the left not buy the lie that politicians can solve their problems and give them free stuff if only they would vote for them? Do people on the left not pursue wealth like everyone on the planet?

You want to paint this simplistic picture where liberals believe what they do because they are the good caring smart people and the right is full of ignorant unsympathetic evil people. The world is not as simple as you would like it to be and there are no storybook heroes and villains. People on the right are just as capable of being smart and kind.",1
You're bad. Who do you think you are?,1
"Eric August​ I am not saying that these issues cannot be discussed intelligently, I was merely saying your analysis far oversimplifies the issues.

I have issues with some things on the right, but there is a spectrum of beliefs and ideas on both sides and to say that the modern day liberal agenda grew out of or even has relevance to the rejection of the fuedal system is overtly absurd. As if people on the right want to be slaves. Besides aren't the liberals the ones wanting government to control wealth again?

I have no big quams with what you said about Trump or Hilary. I would say Hilary is more corrupt and Trump is more volitale, but I am no fan of either of them. I think what you are getting and I agree with is that Republicans and Democrats no longer represent the left or the right. 

You lost me at the end again though. People on the right don't believe that they should be able to do what they want. They tend to believe that people should be able to do whatever they want as long as it is not hurting anyone else or is breaking any laws. That is why I am against abortion because it is the removal of the rights of a baby. It's not about women's rights over their bodies, it's about the rights of babies to their own lives to the right. Whether you agree with it or not, that is the real argument made by the right. You don't seem to want to be fair and put it in a realistic manner. 

Your speech is wholly immature and your thoughts are not carried out well. Again you want it to be simple and that is why you have an impulse to mischaracterize the right, so you can feel that you are the kind caring person who is a hero fighting on the behalf of others and the people who don't ascribe to your worldview must be evil or ignorant.",1
"Thanks for the explanation of the value of critical thought and science. I got it.

You state opinions as fact.

""even though dividing cells are not a life"" can you base this statement on a scientific study. You have not explained the difference between you as a group of cells and a fetus as a group of cells. What make you life and not the fetus? It's funny though because Human cells are living! Cells are life. Wouldn't human cells be human life?

People can think of their future children, but they never have a quandary of sad feelings about not having them if they chose to never conceive one. Definitely not the quandary women having an abortion go through. So what is the difference. All they did differently was stop some cells from dividing.

Deregulation is what liberals believed caused the crisis. Many economist and I would argue that the 2008 financial crisis was caused by the government. Deregulation had nothing to do with it. It had to do with mortgage backed securities that incentives banks to take high risk loans with the knowledge that they would be bailed out. It was fueled by Fannie May and Freddie Mac who went belly up. It had to do with the rock bottom interest rates. These supply demand factors caused by government intervention led to a serious distortion in market signals.

You claim that freedom allows people to take advantage of each other. Can I ask how that happens? If nobody can force me to buy anything or do anything without mutual consent by what mechanism am I being taken advantage of? You scold capitalism as a system that destroys wealth or only gives it to the few. If you were any student of history you would see the exact opposite. Where true free capitalism goes there is more wealth for the masses and wherever it is not there is less wealth for the masses. Look at North and South Korea. Hong Kong and the rest of China. The growth of the U.S. for many periods of history. East vs. West Berlin.

Honestly, I am tapped out because I know this convo will go on and on. I was really hoping you would come to open your mind a little and just admit that there are people who don't think like you who are rational people that are not evil, you just think they are wrong. I Really don't see this happening though.",1
"+Aaron Andrews... hmm, i don't recall claiming anywhere that liberals are more open minded. Anyway, regardless, it's any sane persons duty to go thru as much evidence as they can get their hands on. 

The evidence you tried to present so far ranges from absurd opinion: that regulation always incentives corruption and that lack of regulation will ensure ethical business; also that we can without fail protect ourselves from being taken advantage of as long as we have complete freedom; to complete make- believe-lets-ignore-science:  a ""cell"" is a ""human life"" and climate change is a chinese hoax...granted you did not say that last part...but you believe it, right, admit it.

And when did Diana Pena assert ""being against government theft of private property is not equal to not caring.""? I certainly don't see that anywhere on her post? You are being awfully specific though, so i can assure you on that particular assertion, it does not fall under the ""not caring"" accusation. Here's the ironic: Eminent domain is seldomly invoked since everyone quite naturally thinks little of it, and politicians need to keep their base happy or they get voted out, plus it can only be invoked in the public good (usually building infrastructure, from roads, to waterways, to dams, you'know important public goods; during WWII there was a big uptick on cases, as the country mobilized for war)...plus a hearty effort is made to compensate the owner, so its hardly an issue other than in principle; a principle you rail on against as some kind of indicator that ""government has gone MAD"". 

Yet right now, in texas, asset forfeiture (a law intended to aid police in the war on drugs) is being used on everyday citizens to seize their assets on minor violations. So you have a conservative agenda law, which does not have enough regulation or oversight, being used on american citizens who are not the intended target. So yeah, another example of government gone mad, sure, but this is actually REAL, happens frequently....and to boot, off a conservative agenda: the DRUG WAR! 

We all know government needs to be watched, AND business needs to be watched (BUT way MORE business, since business BUYS government).",1

"4:22 ""We need an OR gate to check if either one of the carry bits was true""
But why? I mean, the only reason we would want to know if there has been a carry number would be to acknowledge overflow (keeping in mind that we are, apparently, adding two 1-bit numbers), in which case we would only be considering the ""carry"" from our second adder. So why is the OR gate connected to our first ""carry""? Can't we just see if the ""carry"" from our second adder is true?",1

"Knowing hardware is integral to being a good computer scientist/programmer/engineer. 

CrashCourse touched on this topic a bit but decimal numbers can't be represented perfectly on hardware. This is about floating point precision. 

The following Java code gives an unexpected result:

public class NumericalPrecisionTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double cnt = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      cnt += 0.01;
    }
    System.out.println(cnt);
  }
}

// expected: 1000 x 0.01 = 10
// actual: 9.999999999999831

This has many real-world consequences (think anything financial related). What about irrational numbers like pi?

Another example. I was reading a stack overflow thread a few hours ago where someone got a 20x speedup by sorting an array before iterating through it. That goes against everything you learn in an algorithms course and common sense in general. 

So how is it possible to get a 20x speedup by performing more work? Because branch prediction (e.g. design of computer architecture). OP got a recommendation (after a ton of discussion and research) to remove the sorting routine and slightly modify an if expression and BOOM instant gains.

The above are examples of why you learn system hardware while taking CS in University. It's pretty damn important!

"0:41: 📚 This class will cover linear regression, batch and stochastic gradient descent, and the normal equations as algorithms for fitting linear regression models.
5:35: 🏠 The speaker discusses using multiple input features, such as size and number of bedrooms, to estimate the size of a house.
12:03: 📝 The hypothesis is defined as the sum of features multiplied by parameters.
18:40: 📉 Gradient descent is a method to minimize a function J of Theta by iteratively updating the values of Theta.
24:21: 📝 Gradient descent is a method used to update values in each step by calculating the partial derivative of the cost function.
30:13: 📝 The partial derivative of a term with respect to Theta J is equal to XJ, and one step of gradient descent updates Theta J
36:08: 🔑 The choice of learning rate in the algorithm affects its convergence to the global minimum.
41:45: 📊 Batch gradient descent is a method in machine learning where the entire training set is processed as one batch, but it has a disadvantage when dealing with large datasets.
47:13: 📈 Stochastic gradient descent allows for faster progress in large datasets but never fully converges.
52:23: 📝 Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm used to find the global optimum, but for linear regression, the normal equation can be used to directly jump to the global optimum.
58:59: 📝 The derivative of a matrix function with respect to the matrix itself is a matrix with the same dimensions, where each element is the derivative with respect to the corresponding element in the original matrix.
1:05:51: 📝 The speaker discusses properties of matrix traces and their derivatives.
1:13:17: 📝 The derivative of the function is equal to one-half times the derivative of Theta multiplied by the transpose of X minus the transpose of y.
Recap by Tammy AI",1
which uni is that...,1
Bro who named that equation as normal equation?,1

"i think he did a mistake when he defined the cost function at 16:17 (for ""m"" training examples). He just gave 1/2 as the constant, which works fine for 1 training example. But i felt a bit weird to use this for m training examples. Its like we are adding ""m"" quantities and dividing by 2? shouldn't it be like an average? I searched google and it showed the formuale for cost function. It showed 1/2m as the factor. which makes sense. The 2 is just a trick so that while differentiating it cancels with the power (which is 2). the 2 in the denominator can be adjusted by the learning factor (alpha). but missing the ""m"" in th denominator doesn't feel right.   Can anyone please approve or disprove this??",1

How many others were ignored or passed over because they were not born into the right kind of family, were not seen as socially acceptable, were the wrong colour, gender etc? How many people currently work in menial jobs overlooked by decision makers, their insight, knowledge and experience ignored?

So first off, we add a machine after H that does that opposite it is told that happens, I don't understand how that disproves H, but I will move on. This new machine is then put in this new machine where it will go into an infinite loop of entering into it'self, thus it doesn't halt and it outputs a no and that is the end of it, and it is also correct as well. Let's assume bizzaro changes it to print out yes instead of H's no, then at that point H would still be correct and bizarro would be wrong. Am I understanding this correctly?",1

"Does the Turing problem really prove there are problems that can't be solves by computation?  Or does it prove that there are problems that can't be answered correctly in general?

For example, if you ask a person ""Will the next word you say have the same definition as 'no'?""
If they say Yes, they are wrong
If the say no, nope, or anything with the same definition they are also wrong.

Doesn't it just prove that it's impossible for anyone/anything to always be right in general?

"I've heard this explanation on the halting problem before. I don't know if it's due to it being simplified to make it easier to present, but the explanation given doesn't work the way it's explained. The program having itself as input would need the input for the input before it could make a determination.  

Lets call the instance of Bizarro sent as the program ""B1"", and the instance sent as input ""B2"".
The question is: Will B1 halt with input B2?
The answer depends on if B2 will halt, but to know that, we need B2's input. Lets call that B3.
Will B2 halt with input B3?
The answer depends on if B3 will halt, but to know that, we need B3's input. Lets call that B4.
Will B3 halt with input B4?
The answer depends on if B4 will halt, but to know that, we need B4's input. Lets call that B5.
...
And so on.

This breakdown occurs before we ever get to producing output. So the output being paradoxical does not really matter.",1

38:00 found the extra excitement and ""off-topic"" statements, smiling of small faults etc. what kept my interest throughout the lecture.

Why n/(2**k) = 1 then k = log(n)??? k should be log 2(n),1
Why is res = [] needed in the power set problem code?  I don't see any reason why it needed to be there.,1
23:09 Aren't string immutables? So this means it will reassign the string res = digits[i%10] + res (by creating a new string). Wouldnt that mean creating a new string log(n) times.Hence shouldn't the complexity be (1 + 2 + 3 ....... log(n)) = (1+log(n))*log(n)/2 == O(log(n)*log(n))?,1

"prof. if assumed are not,at that risk....?",1
"Around 5:30 he says ""... linear is, if you double the size of the input, it's going to double the amount of time it takes. Actually, that's an incorrect statement. Really, what I should have said was, the increment--if I go from, say, 10 to 100, the increase in time is going to be the same as the incremeent if I go from 100 to 1000. Might be more than double depending on what the constant is. But that growth is linear.""

I don't get the difference... he's saying 10->100 = 10x, 100->1000 = 10x, right? And the earlier version was 1->2 = 2x and 2->4 = 2x. Aren't these the same? What am I missing here?",1

"If I have a queue, and it's a tasks queue, once that one task is completed I should remove the element from the queue, or just move the pointers?
And if I should just move the pointers, once that the pointers are on its limits, I would have to create another bigger queue to do what I want, right? This approach wouldn't use a lot of memory?
Once I made this remark, am I right if I define a queue as something that should be just a collection of things that will be freed of the memory soon, once it's completed?

Edit1: I was searching about, and one good response that I found was to use linked-lists, what I think is a great approach, once that it is first-in first-out, so you wouldn't have the problem of needing to change something or access something in the middle of the list, at least I think so.

Also shouldn't the digits at the top be shifted to the right 3 bits to match actual long division, or is that just a quirk using it for CRC?",1

'1001' is 17, and '1101' is 25, so wouldn't you need to add on an additional bit so that '1001' becomes '10010' == 34, so that it is larger than '1101' / 17?

Why does only the first bit matter? Doesn't the divisor need to be less than the value it is dividing?",1

Did u append 3 zeroes before dividing,1
"Why is that called remainder. It is not remainder. Data is 111010, Divisor is 101, so you add two zeros so Data is 11101000 which is 232, 101 is 5 so 232 % 5 == 3 No it's 2 But CRC is 3.

The IPv4 protocol can contain only 4228250625 unique adresses, but there are way more physical devices, connected to the internet, and we can't assign every one of them a unique ip address. The solution I can think of is to have the top level routers split up the network into smaller bits (where the user count is below 4 billion) and then assign unique ip addresses, but then we run into the issue of having to know two (or more) ip addresses per device, one for the router, one for the device. Also, those routers would have to be monsterous to handle that amount of data and supply an adequate amount of latency.

So let's assume your array_2d at every index has a single sub_array or 1 element, then even if you iterate trough it with those 2 for loops, is still 1 operation per sub_array, identical to the normal array case so O(n).  Now in your example where you have each sub_array of size 4, you're still adding a linear ammount of element per each sub_array, therefore if your array_2d is size 5 (5 sub_array of size 4) you're doing `total += i` 20 times, and if your array_2d is size 10 (10 sub_array of size 4) you are doing `total += i` 40 times, array_2d of size 15 would be 60 operations and so on. Therefore this is linear and O(n).    Am I wrong?",1

Because the 'n' in my solution means something else than the 'n' in your solution. Notation wise it seems that my algorithm is more efficient than yours, which is not necessarily the case.

"35:49, how is the worst case scenario in a BST O(logn)?

Let's assume that we have inserted in BST in this order: 9 then 7 then 6 then 4 then 2 then 1

We would have something like this:
                         9 
                       /
                    7

              /
           4
        /
     2
  /
1

And let's say that we are searching the element ""1"". Technically this is a list, so the worst case is O(n). And this is still a BST.

The note says: Binary search requires the list already be sorted, so you can assume that to be the case. This example of BST is sorted. Very nature of BST is that it's sorted. And it's still O(n).

"+Mike Meyer I meant to type hundreds OF thousands, not or. But how often do you deal with game programming? Because when it comes to games where you have gigabytes worth of assets every memory optimization can make a major difference, to the point where people are even concerned over the size of pointers themselves. When you're making a game, or a server for example that may have hundreds or thousands of people on them (this time I meant ""or"") storing their names, and other info about them, plus localization files translating every sentence of dialogue in the game into other languages, etc, you'll end up finding that you use a lot of strings, so making sure you use them as optimally as possible is important in a game.

Secondly stop putting words in my mouth. I did not say loading an entire file is a bad idea, I said loading it all into a damned string is generally not a good idea. Usually in large programs data isn't structured in a format like YAML, JSON, XML, etc, large multi-GB assets are usually of a more binary format where the action you take next depends on the data you received previous, thus loading the asset may require seekable locations in the file. Reading data into a large section of memory is very different than loading it specifically into a string. When you allocate a large section of memory like you mentioned you usually also store the size of that section of memory as well, and you could do that with a string. I was simply trying to give a damned example of how one type of string is better than the other depending on whether you have a lot of small strings, or a few very large ones. If you're going to try to correct someone please pay attention to what they actually say and not what you think they said or whatever you skimmed over.

Many of the more efficient game engines load files directly into memory and then cast the pointer to be of a pointer to a struct, so that they save and load data directly already formatted. When you say ""bad intuition"" how that reads to me is you're saying that other people are pathetic at coding and you're coming off as acting like you're superior to others. I've been programming for 14 years and yet the way you worded your comment made it sound like you didn't think I programmed at all, which is a rather stupid assumption.

"People say that inserting into a linked list is faster than an array, but in both cases it's O(n), finding the element for the linked list or copying the elements of an array.
Except that it's closing to array insertion being n units of time while a linked list is closer to 50n units of time.
For the one use case that linked lists are said to be faster, it's in fact  far slower.
What's faster, knocking on every house on one side of a street, or asking the owner where the next house is and walking across town? People might not think that the ""walk across town"" part applies to a computer but it does.",1
"> inserting to the tail of an array is also O(1) most of the time.
If you are willing to waste space and do not care about the fact that you might run out of contiguous space, yes.

> The same operation on arrays (supposedly worse at this exact thing) in the same time was performed 1000000 times.
How many times has the array been resized during that run? How many times it had to move to
a new contiguous space region? Not all programming languages allow for realloc() like in C, btw.

Linked lists often make sense in combination with other data structures, like a tree e.g., where all leafes are
connected by a linked list. Here is a nice example of a clever data structure that utilizes a list:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_heap .

For most cases (like 97% or so) arrays (or vectors like the one in C++) are the better choice but there can be situations
where lists are better. One has to know both to make a sensible descision when to use what.",1
"Peterolen thank you for your replying, we cannot data is just information, information builds on top of true variable correlation, to define a information we must not only need data and also need relation plus the inspecting to prediction of these related data, these 3 components together combine the define of information, data is just a piece of information. But maybe you wanted to say data is flow just like information, yes it flow in data structure net work, and Yes data structure is organization of data, Address is a location in memory, but memory not represent RAM only, data structure is also memory, memory has sub address, data structure has sub data, so the data in data structure is address, it saved location, data structure is the memory of relations between address and address, so data structure is address structure, is organization of address. So the data is flow that flows in data structure or say data flows in address structure. Sorry for my rough explain. Do you get my point?",1

What does the DNA code for a particular trait look like and how different is a variation on that trait? Is there a biological equivalent of the software system that keeps track of active files vs deleted files that still exist on a disc? (To keep track of all the biological information that is no longer relevant.)

"Who said that philosophers don't posit answers? 
I can't think of one philosopher who just wrote a bunch of questions and never attempted at answering them. 
It is difficult to check the validity of Philosophy, sure. Simply because the question of validity is itself a philosophical question, what makes statements valid, when do we know they are, and why? Philosophy too is constantly informed by the natural sciences, and the natural sciences is informed by philosophy. It is no secret that Einstein studied Spinoza and Schopenhauer, that Heisenberg read Plato, not to mention Leibniz, Francis Bacon, Decartes, Kant, Schopenhauer as well, all were actively involved in the leading science of their time. This is true today as well. 
But I will agree, philosophy should not make claims about the empirical, or when it does it should leave such claim as an hypothesis, but this is not a strong criticism of philosophy as such since philosophy has taken a new roke since the enlightenment, no philosophers make such claims, or rarely so. 

So I haven't seen any well founded critique of philosophy here, ajd once anyone will come up with one, they shoukd realize that that too is philosophy xD",1

But in reality, the difficulty of programming languages is that (usually) you're forced to be unambiguous, complete, precise, and explicit about what you mean and how you intend to manipulate information.

""How do you learn something new, so that you don't forget it sometime soon?""

Because I often find myself forgetting stuff that I have just learned a few days or weeks ago. For example I learn about lists, maps and dictionaries. Then a few days later I want to realize a Programm and start cracking my head what I should use and how it worked. Then I have to Google again and look it up. I have this kind of problem for many things  except the absolute basics.

How did you Crack everything in your head so you don't forget it again?",1

I have a question. Which kind of data structure (array vs linked list) is better for thread parallelization?,1
"I use video editing software, and ran into an issue where it slows down like crazy(!) if I import and edit multiple separate clips(scenario 1). But, if I import one long clip (scenario 2), I can cut it and edit it with almost no lag or slowing down. 

I just watched your video and think the difference between arrays and linked lists almost perfectly fits why this slowdown occurs. The program has an autosave function that, by design, you cannot turn off, so every change to any part of the entire video gets saved after making it. Therefore, in scenario 2, any edit I make saves quickly because it just saves the changes in the single box in the ""easy to find, partitioned place"", and does not have to change or look at any other part of the array.  Whereas,  in scenario 1, the save feature has to run through every box/clip in the video in order to find any changed clip and save the changes made.  

Does this seem, generally, like an appropriate way to think of and apply array and linked list data structures? 

Thanks,  looking forward to watching more of your videos!",1

If we're only focused on order of arrival and not adding additional elements to a sorted list, wouldn't you just be able to start from the end of the array and add each in the order they arrived? 

What's the difference in terms of cost between adding additional linked list pointers to the tail and adding additional elements to the end of an array if the array isn't a fixed size? Am I missing something? I'm thinking in JavaScript so perhaps there is a fixed size for arrays in other languages...",1

"Me watching this wanting to go into a CS career but seeing this I have so many questions. Such as if you have a matrix, how does the read enable, write enable, and the data in get to the specific gated latch( I understand how it knows which one to go to but how does 1 wired reach each 1 independently or does it just send it to every single gated latch but only the one with the grid location get accessed). And if it’s 8 bit and has 8 256bit modules then why does the board only have 4 for each section. Does it count for 2 like since it’s 128 by 64?",1
Humans are amazing aren't they?,1
Jon Sleeper Welp that's the goal isn't it?,1
So this is cache memory? like the cache on a a processor?,1
How's your studies going so far? I remember when I first got exposed to this stuff and nearly dropped out due to its complexity. Luckily my professors urged me on and now I'm a graduate student for CS + working as a project lead for a company :),1
Can you imagine that... THE 1980s!!! If people knew how complicated the stuff we already have is and tried to understand it instead of letting a brilliant minority do everything we’d be a much more advanced civilisation.,1
Don't you mean blown to bits dwl,1
"kahdargo7, I agree with you. I really don't understand how loading each 256-bit block with the same data can store a unique number. And one 256-bit block can already store 8 bits, so I don't get why she needs multiple blocks. Should her address maybe be 11-bits so that there are 3-bits in the address to select which 256-bit block to store the data in?",1
   Wasn't a single latch doing the same task? How making a matrix saved the no of wire when storing a 256 bit number?,1
Isn't the transistor technically an AND gate since both inputs need to be on for it to work?,1
Does anyone here know of a playlist that covers more of this circuit stuff? I'd love to see more of it.,1
Wait. Shouldn't it be decoder instead of multiplexer?,1
"Believe it or not, there's a whole niche of scientists who specifically learn how to use a computer (i.e. computer scientist) so we can figure out how to better study DNA (i.e. biologist). Want a whole mess of pain from both CS and Bio? Try Bioinformatics :)",1
   By whom ?,1
"A decoder could be ANY circuit that takes `m` inputs and decodes it into `n` outputs according to some predefined pattern. It doesn't have to be BCD on the input nor decimal on the output.
Also, what's ""decimal output""? Logic circuits don't work in decimal. If anything, a BCD to ""decimal"" decoder simply selects one of the 10 outputs according to the binary number on the input, so it's pretty much the same thing as a multiplexer with a constant signal 1. A proper multiplexer would take one more input to know what kind of signal to put on one of those 10 outputs.",1
Where were you when I was studying for my computer engineering final two weeks ago?,1
Wait? I have to LOOK UP how a multiplexer works!?,1
No love for core memory?,1
"This confused me at first too because there's plenty of memory on one register to store the info, right? but there's only one data wire available to recall it. So a single byte would need to be stored across the whole memory bus",1
Ashton Cofer what if the test is literally this and more videos are needed?,1
Anyone notice the Minecraft creeper in the background?,1
"Why don't you say ""hello world"" anymore!!?????
It 'bugs' me!",1
Yeah. So what?,1
Carrie Anne is what makes this series! so pleasant to watch and learn from!,1
"Btw I have a question and it probably has an obvious answer, but I'm completely blind to it at the moment. 

With the AND-OR Latch, let's say it was set to 1 and then both ""set"" and ""reset"" pins are 0 afterwards, how exactly does the chip output a 1? I mean, how would a 1 be produced without... current?",1
Awesome video with quality information. Keep it up😃😀,1
Hey! Where's the Crash Course comp sci merch? Loving this series!,1
I used to make circuit boards for con Edison for small applications ie.street lights.very interesting stuff,1
John Hightower Dali? I thought that phrase sounded familiar!,1
"Awesome leture now understand what is ram ,what is registers thanks a lot",1
"All the videos are super cool, super easy to understand and entertaining, please keep doing this. Note: are we really starting to use billion to refer to one thousand millions instead of one million millions in science? I know that the financial sector uses it in that way (for what ever reason) but science has been using it correctly like for ever, but I keep seeing this use of billion occurring over and over. Is it a trend?",1
Is there a similar video on ROM? I've been searching for a video like this one on it but I can't find any that explains it this well.,1
"9:57 What does she mean by accessing any memory location in a ""random order""?",1
"This video is fantastic, but what logic goes into a multiplexer? Everything else made sense but that was skimmed over and is really important",1
how does this relate to storing data in certain structures such as the stack and the heap?,1
How do you build a ram stick with matrices that small,1
"So inside our gated latch, how does the charged or ""1"" state stay persistent even when it's disconnected from in and out? Isn't an OR gate with output tied back to an input like a perpetual motion machine or something? What's keeping it charged?",1
when we put the memory units of 256 bit together and feed up the same address to all of them how this address work in that scope? because I cant think of it as when it was explain in the smaller scope of 256bit,1
"Why we use mutiplexer for choosing rows and colums.Because i saw other references,they used decoders for that?",1
"One thing i'm confused on is that if a set of 8 x 256-bit memory registers were put together and then is fed the same memory address and the same write enable wire, would they not all produce the same output because the same thing is being done to all of them? Why would it not be just 11111111 and 00000000? How does each register have a different bit if they are all fed the same 8 bit address and same write enable? Is it that they all are fed different Data in/out wires?",1
So question: How did the computer 'save' the bit at a low level before silicon wafers? Didn't it require electricity to run through the circuit? Wouldn't that mean it wouldn't have persistent memory since the electricity would turn off once you unplugged the computer? Or does the saved bit continue around the circuit without power?,1
How does the multiplexer work? It seems important for understanding,1
"Are these memory registers the same as (or related to) Assembly registers (rax, rbp, etc.)?",1
"Dear Carrie Anne,

thanks you very much for the whole series! Could you please suggest me literatures/ reference material for this episode?

CrashCourse at 7:50 you didn't specify how 4 bits converted into one out of 16 and so I search the term multiplexer but the images that show the design of AND and NOT gates in a multiplexer only has an output of 1 bit from a combination of bits but then I see articles that link the term multiplexer and decoder so I look the term decoder up and it seems that that more accurately represents what is happening on the image on the screen. So I have been confused of how this works and if I'm missing something because of my bad interpretation of this image(or if it has something to do with something in the future)(or something similar) or  if you have mixed up these terms or the terms change from country to country.

There are 4 form of data stored In computer.

4. Magnetic pole. Hard disk use this way.

How does it work ? What component will make the decision that there is a 0 or 1 in the capacitor ?How does it work ?

For example, if pin 1 goes high for 2 nanoseconds, and pin 2 goes high for 1 nanosecond at the same time, will this trigger an output signal from the AND gate?  Or do the signals need to overlap for a certain period of time? (i.e. both signals need to be high on the AND gate inputs for 5 nanoseconds simultaneously to trigger an output signal)

At 4:13 you explained that the output wire was off because current could pass through the transistor.

"I'm really confused about the transistor diagram.
If the input wire is on the left (and you can't just have an electrical current flow in through a single wire with nowhere else for the current to go)
and the output is on the bottom
but the 'on/off' is controlling whether power can go from the top to the bottom
then
1. What's the point of the upper wire if all the transistor does is let power in from the left down.  Your input is the left and your output is the bottom.  Right?  So why is it any different than taking a 90 degree turn and ignoring the whole transistor?
2. What mechanism are we using to throttle the left signal on and off?  Isn't whatever is messing with that already doing the 0/1

"Hi crashCourse, i have a little problem. even so what you said was true, and the way you described the gates should work in real computers, i have learnt in the book ""But how do it"" that every gate is made of NAND gates. For example, the NOT gate is made up of a NAND gate which has both input linked together, which results that if you have input on, output is off and vice-versa. but NAND gates themselves schould be made up with an OR gate with to NOT gates at the input, or even an AND gate with a NOT gate at the  output. So do you have an idea why they decided to  explain it the way they did in the book? is there any advantage to build everything with NAND gates only?",1

"I'd like to point out some of the flaws in the competition argument: 
1. the EU tried it for about a year or two...it didn't go well
2. some ISPs have virtual monopolies of coverage in some places where they have no competition
3. even with competition bigger richer companies still have an advantage they can pay to prioritise themselves 
4. un-throttling a website could be seen as a business opportunity likely only doing so in pricier networking plans
5. if ISPs ACTUALLY believed this argument repealing net neutrality would change literally nothing to them the rule change would be inconsequential and they wouldn't be lobbying the goverment so hard to get rid of it",1
"Pfhorrest so how do you distinguish between the two? Inspect the traffic? Nobody is going to voluntarily make their service slow by setting some kind of low priority flag. How would you enforce that? Encrypted traffic can't even be prioritized by inspection.

Net neutrality needs all packets equal, or the system can be cheated and twisted by anyone.",1
"I mean, are you a shill? Working for Comcast? AT&T? WB?
A QoS service that runs on ISP networks and backbones absolutely violates net neutrality because differentiating kinds of services is as severe a violation of the core concept of neutrality as endpoints. If you pay your ISP for a certain speed of connection, and they then prioritize or deprioritize certain kinds of traffic unless you pay for their QoS ""Mega Streaming Bundle,"" then that's just as bad. You're paying for the speed of your connection and then also a fee for how you use that speed?
 That you paid for already? No endpoint differentiation required; all prioritization of traffic on any criteria violates net neutrality. That is in fact how they are most likely to start dragging us all into the worst case scenario. Besides, as many above me have pointed out, implementations vary far to much to identify traffic reliably by anything BUT the endpoint.
What's behind your great love of QoS anyway? Pay for a faster connection. Unless you share access across a LAN, or live in a rural area with limited bandwidth, QoS at the WAN level isn't going to impact your service because that's not where the bottleneck is. If QoS is going to help you then you need it on your router locally anyway or else it's not going to make any difference.
Also, it may seem obvious to you that video should take priority over email, but not all users are going to agree with you. Checking email requires almost no bandwidth by today's standards; if your streaming HD video has even a few seconds worth of video buffered any email download on the same connection is going register as barely a blip. Meanwhile, someone using email for a practical purpose may not wish to have their time sensitive, important, email check delayed because you happen to be watching Game Thrones on the same pipe. This is why net neutrality is important in the first place.",1
"   Because look at Google Fiber not even Google could get the proper permits to run Fiber in a few cities, all the lobbiest bullied them out. 
Could you imagine a normal group of people attempting to join the market? not only that the large upfront cost of setting up internet infrastructure, the market isn't free because no one can compete so there is no competition and if someone starts to act poorly to the customer they have no choice but to take it.


This is why Internet needs to be regulated like a utility and up until trump it was... Sadly Trump appointed a Verizon lobbiest to be the head of the regulators of the ISP's (FCC) and he killed net neutrality.

But isn’t it from Harvard?,1
   why are those bad?,1
"   do you know anything about modern programming languages? They are all based to an extent on C. Almost every language has roots in the C language.

   where is c used?,1
"Yeah I like his style too.  I used to teach C back in the day.  I wish I had thought of making a sandwich, for describing a program.  In the UK we like cups of tea.  So I used that.  Or sometimes, how do come to class, most came in cars...",1

I'm from morocco and I will never forget how you helped me improve my skills thanks to you and to cs50.Thank you verry veeerrrry much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,1

Aren't freecodecamp and cs50 entirely different programs?,1
where are the five minutes break😭,1
"At risk of reprisals....I thought it was way too fast and difficult to follow. Speaking fast without breaks is not necessarily great enthusiasm which is what society generally accepts in current generation. I would rather he took his time and gave us time for the learning to sink in. Am sure to this others would say - he is teaching advance students who don’t need a slow teacher. I don’t necessarily mean slow, but just some one who is not come out of fresh few lines of coke",1

"hey carrie (or anyone else if you would like to help) ,  I wanted to understand that private key sharing( at 10:00) , so i thought of making myself a simple practical example out of it, but my calculations say your equation from 10:00 is not correct . can you please have a look?   


So If i have to transmit character '""P' (ascii 80 )from Boy A to B:


>> I assumed x=2 would be private key of A and y=3 would be private key of B) 
>> I assumed my public  key function as cipher(x,y)= (3^x % 7)^y
Thus: 
   -  A would first Transfer cipher_a = 3^2%7 = 2 to B
   -  B would first Transfer cipher_ a= 3^3%7 = 6 to A



>> I assumed my publically available encryptor function as  encrypted_text = cipher(B) ^x  + ascii(character) 
- Thus, A would transfer the encrypted character 'P' to be as  e_t = (6)^2+80 = 106 


>> I assumed my publically available decryptor function as   ascii(character) = encrypted_text - cipher(A) ^y

- Thus, B would recieve the value as val =  106-  (2)^3 = 97 , which is not equal to our original value of 80


Thus (B^y mod M)^x != (B^x mod M)^y != (B^xy mod M)


But rather
(B^yx mod M^x) == (B^xy mod M^y) but != B^xy %M

    print ""x ="", x, "", y ="", y, "", z ="", z

If it was a built-in function, having a built-in companion function that did a similar thing without inserting spaces and adding a newline would be the logical thing to do (or adding keyword parameters to control that behavior; but I prefer a second function); but with only print as it currently stands, you'd have to switch to something like

    print ""x = "" + str(x) + "", y = "" + str(x) + "", z = "" + str(z)

A person throws their ""highest efficiency"" desktop in the trash and uses a ""lower efficiency"" smart phone. Thus a geometric increase in their efficiency. As efficiency has always increased in this manner, it reasonable to assume the same geometric progression will continue. What use is a measure of efficiency for what a person has no value of? Resource use efficiency absent the information of peoples wants. Reciprocal exchange efficiency is dependent on aggregate wants of people.

"""Letting supply/demand take it forward would have meant going at a medieval pace. 50 years may be optimistic.""
Analogous to: 100,000 people want resources to go toward innovating ALL others things by the calcuaiton of 100.000 self invested minds, but one person called ""government"" has a gun and forces those people not to innovate in EVERYTHING ELSE.

""Letting supply/demand take it forward would have meant going at a medieval pace. 50 years may be optimistic.""
And so what if allowing aggregate EVERYONE to innovate what they want slows the pace of what a few people in government want to justify taking tax for?
I think you should pay for what you don't want, therefore I'm correct? Explain.

"+ Dai Qibao I still don't understand. How is a system of research where scientists submit proposals to a gov't agency and receive or don't receive funding based on the priorities of the current gov't fundamentally different from a system where scientists try to impress venture capitalists, or rich philanthropists with project proposals and receive or don't receive funding based on that persons priorities?

Government ceases a person bank account for a tax purpose - A government cannot cancel or freeze some-ones bank account for not paying taxes but the bank that provides you will a personal bank account can cancel or freeze that account for not paying service fees or they can repossess your house and throw you out on the street for not paying your mortgage. Under the law in some states grocery stores and restaurants can refuse to sell you food if they suspect you might be gay. Insurance companies can deny you health coverage if they think you are too fat or because you inherited a genetic disease from your parents. 

PS without government there would still be authority figures backed by violence - crime lords or war lords to take over instead. Violence can never be eliminated the question is only how do we decide who gets to wield it.",1

If A, B, C, and D are all on the same channel, I would expect one of those (such as B) to be an access point while A and C are clients, so A only talks to B, and C only talks to B. So the only reason C would talk to D is if D is another access point which means if designed well would be on another channel and C/D wouldn’t even hear transmissions from B or A even if they were close enough

So would this problem only arise where all four nodes are in Ad-hoc mode with no Access Point, or if the system operator is forced to have adjacent Access Points on the same channel due to lack of available channels?",1

"Sir ,what is meant by noiseless channels and noisy channel?..",1
Sir u said if ack is lost sender waits for infinite time for it. This tells that it has got no timer based connection them how ack delay is even a problem for the sender. It is sending one data at a time why is it even going to thing it is the ack of some other data ?,1
If sender only sends data after receiving the ACK and it happening one by one then how a delayed ack might be wrongly considered as ack of the some other data???? The Ack must be of the data sent before it. !! Right ?,1

MIT instructors seem to do very well in comparison to others...but arguably the top schools are the same in this respect... 
The difference in MIT is the content. Typically, in the example problem sets the problems solved using each concept has more complexity, larger data sets or some bit of complex mathematics to solve. 
Perhaps this prepares the graduate for real world problems?
Perhaps this adds a bit of unnecessary complexity to a given concept?

"Xniva's notes:

4:23 - Knowledge of concepts, programming skill, problem solving

4:46 - Topics: 1. Represent knowledge with data structures / Iteration and Recursion as computational metaphors, 2. Abstraction of procedures and data types / Organise and modularise systems using object classes and methods 3. Different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting / Complexity of algorithms.

7:03 - What does a computer do? Performs calculation, remembers results.  What kind of calc? built-in to the language, one that you define as the programmer. It only know what you tell them.

8:44 - Types of knowledge. 1. Declarative knowledge - Statement of fact 2. Imperative knowledge is a recipe or ""how-to""

Imperative programming: telling ""How to do it"" and Declarative programming: telling ""What we want to happen"" without telling how

14:37 - What is a recipe: 1. Sequence of simple steps 2. Flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed. 3. a means of determining when to stop.

15:55 - Two types of computer - 1. fixed program computer - calculator. 2. Stored program computer - machine stores and executes instruction. 

17:33 - Basic machine architecture : 1. Memory(Bunch of data, sequence of instructions), 2. CPU(ALU - primitive ops, CU - program counter), Input and Output

20:04 - Sequence of instructions stored inside computer: primitive instructions - arithmetic and logic, simple tests and moving data. Special program (interpreter) executes each instruction in order - use tests to change flow of control through sequence, stop when done

20:39 - Turning showed that you can compute anything using 6 primitives - Read, Write, Move left, Move right, Scan and Do nothing. Modern programming languages have more convenient set of primitives. Can abstract methods to create new primitives. Anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language. 

21:58 - a programming language provides a set of primitive operations, expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language. 

22:58 - syntactically invalid , static semantic error

24:52 - Semantics - is the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors. 

29:34 - Program manipulate data objects. Object have a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them. 
Objects are scalar(cannot be subdivided) and non -scalar(have internal structure that can be accessed) 

31:14 - Scalar objects - int -5, float - 3.27, bool , None. type()

34:22 - Combine objects and operators to form expressions. An expression has a value, which has a type. Syntax for a simpler expression : <object> <operator> <object>

35:29 - Operators on ints and floats: + - * / % **",1

What happens to the old memory? You said that they are deleted after the old array is copied. So does the memory address of the last array now map to an empty space? Or is the whole “tape” of memory reconfigured?,1
What happens to the bytes that were used to hold the old array then? Will they be freed up?,1
"Thanks for your videos YK, they are really helping me out. I was wondering if you could answer this question for me:


In the last of your examples you talk about taking an array with a length of 10 and replacing it with a new array of 20 to allow for additional items. 
Is it possible to create an array with partitions but assign no values to them so they are empty and waiting to be filed with values? Eg. We have 11 items but we create a new array that can accommodate 20 items leaving 9 empty  partitions. If this is how it is, then what are the bit values of these empty partitions until they are assigned int or string etc values?


Thanks again!",1

But what happens when I use all the space for PyCharm and it reached the start of Chrome's memory.. If I need more space for PyCharm, how and where it will be allocated? I can see in the Activity Monitor app on mac, that memory for Chrome is split into different items.

"My biggest question after watching this is: 

what happens when you delete older arrays (or anything stored in previous pieces of memory)? For example, if you had an array of length 4, then made a new one and deleted that older array; you would have a 4-byte gap in memory. How does the OS handle these gaps so it's not just wasted space? Because obviously you can only put another 4-byte piece of data in that slot and the more you delete older data, the more gaps you'll have, increasing potentially wasted memory.

Hopefully that made sense...and I apologize if this is a bit too complex for the scope of what you're teaching lol",1
What the point of using linked list in language like JavaScript and python?,1
"u said that we can't add more numbers to the array, In Python and JavaScript there is methods that adds new elements to the array.

A) The numbers of cables neded in mesh topology is 15     
 
2) How many ports are needed for each device ?
A) 5 ports are needed for each device.

3) How many ports are Needed in entire network?

"Answer to H.W. at 03:50

Given Bit Sequence without Bit Stuffing (I think there is No Beginning and Ending Sequence) : 110101111101011111101011111110

I as a Sender taking that data bits sequence from upper layer and see three ""5 Consecutive 1's"". What are they ?

1101011111(1st)01011111(2nd)101011111(3rd)110  

Put 1st=2nd=3rd=0

1101011111(0)01011111(0)101011111(0)110 = Given Bit Sequence with Bit Stuffing in video.

Hence, It is Correct.",1
why there is an addition in the beginning of the sequence since there is no 6 1s,1
"Question. What if data recieved from upper layers is in fact five zeroes seperated by a one, how will the reciever know whether bit stuffing is applied or not?",1
"I think its incorrect as at the last there is series of 7 1's and that satisfies the requirement of not repeating the protocol sequence. though  a 0 is added in that series after 5 consecutive 1's.
Is it necessary to do so? Or is it possible to have the series of 7 consecutive 1's.",1
​   how bro? Receiver will start reading from the beginning sequence bits right,1
Doesn't matter ending and beginning sequences are palindromes /,1
True ...I got the same doubt...did u get the answer?,1
   but if the sender removes the 0 after 5 ones.. Isn't it making the data erroneous?,1
"   so bit-stuffing is something which should be there in all cases, regardless of the message you want to send?",1
great question. any idea?,1
"3:43 Sir, if considering a case where after 5 consecutive 1's the next one was already 0 and regardless of that bit value we have to stuff the 0 bit and remove while receiving the data in the receiver node?",1
"A question : what if the original payload contained a part where there is a 0 after 5 consecutive 1s, and the reciever will identify it as bit stuffing and remove it, would'nt it corrupt the original data ?",1
What if in the data the bits are originally having 5  ones and then a 0 ... Receiver then will consider the actual bits to be stuffed and will remove the 0 after 5 ones ... But that was the actual data?,1
what happens when there was no bit stuffing but sender confuses the zero after 5 ones as bit stuffing,1
Is the question contains only body part or not.. (Does it contains begining and ending part also? ),1
"Can anyone pls solve this problem?

a communication channel can transmit up to ten 8 bit ascii characters per second. find its bandwidth in bps and baud rate",1
"Thank you,  Based on what I learned,  both sentences should be Correct? Isn't it?",1
"if data = 11111011111 
then what will be output after bitstuffing?",1
"I guess both the question are correct as both of them as the bit stuffing done at some point in the whole data. Although bit stuffing is done 3 times in 2nd question and once in 1st question.
Is are answers matching?",1
"If sender sends 01111101
Then receiver will eliminate 0 after five 1 nd get wrong data 
What is solution of that",1
What if in flag all are 1,1
"   can you elaborate this as to why we still need to insert 0 deliberately? Since the ending would be different than that part of the message, there shouldn’t be any problem in receiving the data?",1
   well I actually don't get what is happening if the original data is itself five 1's and then one 0. Will this 0 also be destuffed? Cause this would change the original data.,1
Sir pls explain h.w sum.. i cant understand..there is no same bits in starting and ending sequence thn how will we identify bit stuffing in data part or not?,1
Hey wat if the data contains normally 111110 (five 1s and 0) it will change the original data to 111111 in the receiver part ?? But actually it shouldn't? Wats the solution,1
everytime bit starting and ending pattern has to be 01111110 or it can be any?,1
I think bit stuufing done correct in ending question of lectute... If am wrong kindly mention how.  Thank you sir,1

"Kayla Gallatin (this is in reference to your reply to me and not anything else).

I think they do discriminate and this media does legitimise (even only a few). Furthermore, I don't think it's an unconscious bias, I genuinely believe there's a conscious bias against men. I realise I probably sound a bit hysterical but I'm serious when I say this. What benefit does hiring a man over a woman give someone unless they are quantifiably twice as good as the woman?

Also, I have to admit I feel the only people putting the stereotype on girls not to do CS is feminists. I've known a few CS students and none would even dare to say it's a boy's subject. Educators at my school also wouldn't dream of saying they. I know it's my tiny world but I honestly don't know where people get these perceptions from",1

Can we just use 1 or just 0 as divisor? Or 1 bit divisior?,1
"Before corrupt the data:
Divisor:1001

Remainder(CRC):100

How many agree with this answer?",1

"   Actually, most colleges start with Java, I've been to 3 colleges in Colorado at least, CU Denver, MSU Denver, Regis University and they all started with Java, I know a friend in a college in California, and he said he started with C++ as his first language. Which college did you go to that they started with python? that Is my question, no doubt further down the line most of these colleges will have other classes that offer python as a second or third language. I don't think starting with python would be ideal in most colleges given that when they teach data structures and algorithms they use arrays as the foundation to teach you how they work in great depth, but arrays are practically non existing in python, everything is already predefined as list, tuples and dictionaries. 

However, if you aren't interested in writing effective code, given the rise of powerful computers, than python is a great first language, but it is not what ""most"" universities start with.",1

Hello sir.  I have a question when you get to 4:00.  I'm not sure what you mean about LAN 1 and LAN 2 having an IP address and subnet mask.  What has those IP addresses on those LANS?  Is it a computer?  Switch?  A LAN can't have it's own IP add and subnet mask.,1
why two set of IP address in a LAN eg:10.0.0.0 & 255.0.0.0 ?,1
what is an interface in router ??,1
Then how can it reach the particular pc r anything,1

How does the router 1 decides whether to route the packet towards  router 2  or router 3 in that case?,1
How the sender know Port number of receiver?,1

The closest I can think of are tasks which involve replacing a human in situations based on human interaction, but I'm not convinced that that would be economically viable.

Second, people are more than a bit creeped out by the idea of robots being human. The most complex tasks which would require programs closer and closer to strong AI to automate--management, child-rearing, legislation--are also the tasks which humans would be least comfortable handing over to what could some day turn into Skynet (or at least the Axiom).
