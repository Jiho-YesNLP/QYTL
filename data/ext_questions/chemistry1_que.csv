Is the deltaH = q approx = deltaU only at constant Temperature?,1
Hello first thanks about you're explain but I ask if scientists predictions methods can they reach to determination of finding exact speed and position? ,1
"Sir, is this correct?

The measurements (in S.I. units)of minima of uncertainties position and momentum of a particle of mass 1 nanogram is that their ratio is 1:4. Then what is the minimum uncertainties in the measurement of its kinetic energy?
Suppose the uncertainty in position be x, then uncertainty in momentum =4x
Then 4x2 = h/4œÄ = 5.3 x 10-35
So x = 3.64 X10-18
So uncertainty in momentum= 4x =  4(3.64 X10-18 )= 14.56 X10-18
Then uncertainty in speed = (uncertainty in momentum )/mass
= (14.56 X „Äñ10„Äó^(-18))/(1X „Äñ10„Äó^(-12) ) = 14.56 X 10-6
Uncertainty in kinetic energy = 1/2 m(‚àÜV)2 
= 0.5X 10-12 X (14.56 x 10-6)2 = 1.06 X 10-21J",1

"Hi, I'm hoping you can help me with this question. 

My son is in 10th grade chem, and he has a test coming up with questions about ionization in relation to Coulomb's Law. On a practice test, he is shown 3 Bohr Models (Sodium, Potassium and Aluminum) and is asked ""which one would requires the least amount of energy to remove an election? Using ionization energy and relate Coulomb's Law in your final answer.""  The answer key to the practice test says that Aluminum is the easier of the three to remove an electron because there is more that one valence electron in the shell, and the inner electrons are shielding the nucleus, thus making it easier to remove an electron. 

Everything I've come across only speaks to the position on the periodic table. I can't find anything that includes the number valence electrons. Does the number of valence electrons influence ionization energy?

Based on your video. I would have chosen Potassium as requiring the least amount of energy to remove an electron because it is below Sodium and below and to the right of Aluminum. Meaning, it's valence electron in further from the nucleus of both Na and Al, and Al has more protons and thus a stronger pull on the electrons.

Still, something remains unclear to me, maybe you would be so kind to answer it?

The thermodynamic potential for G = U - TS + PV,
with U the inner energy.
With dU = T dS - PdV (no particle exchange assumed),
this leads to dG = -SdT + VdP.

You said that the derived equation, dG = dH - TdS, only holds for constant pressure and constant temperature (dP=dT=0). But then for the above eq. we have:
dG = -SdT + VdP = 0 = dS_universe

      7) Formal-Charge ==> FC(atom) = OG_Valency - DOTs - LINEs
====================================================================================================



1. When Atoms Share Electron ==> It's a Covalent Bond ==> We write it:- WITH a DASH 
    - 1.1) SHARING ==> UNDER THE HOOD:- 
    - 1.2) What happens if we get to something a little bit more complicated, WATER? 
    - 1.3) How are electrons shared in Covalent bonds? ===> That is where LEWIS comes in / will help 
2. Lewis Structure P1
    - There's a fairly Simple Recipe 
    - Water 
    - Lone-Pairs / Non-Bonding / Not-Bonding 
    - SHAPES NEXT WEEEEEK! 
    - Chroline-Oxide-ANION 
    - Formaldehyde / Carbonyl-Hydride / Formalin / Methylene oxide 
    - Carbon-Dioxide 

    - Invoke Step-6 / STROGER SHARING BOND! 
    - Multiple seems legit, which one is correct? ==> Formal-Charge (FC) 

3. FC(atom) = #OG_Valency - #dots - #lines 
    a) BIGGEST NOTE:- 
      - it is FC(atom) .... not FC(molecule).... ====> i.e. we calculate Formal-Charge on ""each individual atom""
      - OG_Valency:- #Valence-Electrons of that atom that we are calculating Formal-Charge of, before it participated in the bond ===> That atom's neutral (Not ION) #valence-electrons

    b) UNDER THE HOOD:-
      - Why not (-2) for each LINE? ==> Bonding Electrons are divided equally between the bonded atoms 

    c) What's The Big Deal / Connection to LEWIS?
      - Lewis-Structure /w set of FCs ""closest to zero"" (i.e. we count the ABSOLUTE VALUES of FCs) is usually the most stable!
      - NOTE:- ABSOLUTE VALUES
        - | FC(atom) |         [mathematical absolute values symbol (bars)]

    d) WHY THIS MATTERS? 
        - Has to do it, with ====> HOW IT MOVES ====> with it's VIBRATIONS (wiggling).... (whooooah, not covered in this series)

    => Tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electron to itself (in a bond). 
    5.1. PAULING:- Arbitrarily Set  ùõò(Fluorine) = 4, he first set ùõò(Hydrogen) = 2.1 -----------> After years, now it's ùõò(Hydrogen) = 2.2

        a) If the DIfference is High ==> Then that means, One of the Atoms Grabbed the electrons  e.g. Œîùõò(Sodium-Chloride) = 2.23      & again 
        b) If the DIfference is Zero ==> Then that means, PURE   COVALENT BOND                                      Œîùõò(Chlorine-Diamar) = 0         
        c) If the Diff. is Smwhere in between ==> means, POLAR COVALENT BOND                                 Œîùõò(Hydrogen-Chloride) = 0.96   

    5.2. There are actually many ElectroNegativity SCALES 
    5.3. If the DIfference between this concept (of ElectroNegativity) from One atom to another, is ZERO ==> well, then That Must be a Pure COVALENT BOND! 
    5.4. Sodium-Chloride (NaCl) 34:15
    5.5. POLAR COVALENT = PARTIALLY IONIC 
            GRAPH:-    IONIC CHARACTERISTICS PERCENTAGE v/s/ ElectroNegativity  

    5.6. a) Œîùõò > 2 --> Ionic           
            b) Œîùõò < 1.6 --> Polar Covalent          
            c) Œîùõò = 0 --> Pure Covalent 

            d) Œîùõò in Range (1.6 --> 2.0) --> VARIATIONS (either IONIC or POLAR-COVALENT).... in that Intermediate Regime 

    5.7.               Œîùõò(NaBr) = Œîùõò(HF) = 1.9                   [Gotta be Carefull]

"It seems the most obvious & logical explanation for a #particle acting like an #AxialWave when moving thru space is that it's orbiting something (a dark matter particle perhaps) or visa versa.

It's not unlike Earth being pulled into a wobble by the moon, or a distant star's wobble evidencing planet orbits making our trajectory as we fly thru space have an axial wave (packet) as well.

And since we think we know undetectable dark matter exists but don't yet know where it's distributed, this seems the most logical possibility.  What do you think?

This could explain the double slit experiment results, including with a detector with some interaction between the dark matter and the detector.",1
"¬†¬† ‚ÄúBlind belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth.‚Äù Albert Einstein.
Take the Earth and the Moon instead of an electron and a proton. They attract due to gravity in the Newtonian theory. (Einstein said that they each move without acceleration in spacetime curved by gravity). Would you now say that the classical Newtonian theory is invalid because the Moon and Earth would crash?
The argument why classical theory doesn't work with atoms is not that the particles would crash because of their attraction. The classical theory would work if they would circle around each other like the Moon and the Earth if you are not taking into account that Maxwell's equations say that accelerated charges (circling charges are accelerated) radiate energy. The latter is the reason why classical electrodynamics fails.
So the MIT instructors argument is flawed.",1

Question from 33:00-34:00: Is the RDS for a multistep reaction the step with the largest Ea (i.e. largest energy gap from reactant to TS for one step), or the step with the highest Ea (i.e. highest energy TS overall)?  In your example the 1st step is both of these, but if the 2nd step had a slightly higher TS energy than the 1st step, would the 2nd step now become the RDS, even though the 1st step still has a larger gap from reactant energy to TS energy for that step?",1

"Thank you for posting this lecture ( and the others ) on the Gibbs free energy.  The derivation you worked out in another video that shows the change in Gibbs energy is simply the negative change of the entropy of the universe multiplied by the absolute temperature was particularly helpful. :) 
I would like to challenge you on one point however - in several of the videos you describe the system at constant T and P ; and then you go one step further and declare the system at constant volume using ideal gas law.  
I am wondering if this is an unnecessary restriction.  Using the closed form of the 1st law - and by differentiating the property relation h=u+pv, it is straightforward to show that Q=deltaH.  The only restriction is constant pressure and reversible boundary work.  
In any case, isn't the constant T and V case managed with the Helmholtz free energy?

Wouldnt heterogenous and homogenous mixtures be on a scale from one to the other? if so how would you define a mixture as being hetero/homogenous? or is it a broad term?,1
"i find all of your videos extremely helpful (took me 5 min to understand electrolytic cell). i have two questions regarding this topic.

1. how do you determine bond strength?

2. do the 3 factors you listed that influence acid strength have any priority over each other? eg. if i have two acids with two corresponding X-H and Y-H bonds , if Y-H is more polar than X-H, would that fact trump factor 1 where if we suppose X-H has a stronger bond than Y-H?¬†

another quick question (sorry took gen chem a LONG time ago), these rules are only relevant when comparing the ¬†strengths of weak acids/bases RELATIVE to each other, correct? because strong acids will disassociate completely and their conj. bases will not want to re-attach an H+, thus having virtually no basicity.¬†

Sir the time in the video is 24:34 sir you said that when atomic orbitals overlap they now cease to exist and create a 2 molecular orbitals ok. Sir well if both the atomic orbitals have same mathematical signs of function it will definitely leads to constructive overlap but sir if the mathematical signs of orbitals remain unchanged then how do simultaneously the anti bonding molecular orbital create ??

"Hi Chad, can you explain why acids only donate 1 H+ to become a base?  For example, why isn't the base of acid CH3COOH  then CH2-COO- for example, or why not donate all the H to become C(3negative)COO-? Or NH4+ then N(4negative) instead of NH3?",1
What does your shirt say?,1
But did you mean to say the C-H bonds are not polar?  Instead of H-C?,1

"I have a question about the color. You said ""If we have more H+ (acid), the equilibrium shifts to HIn (blue)."" Does it mean the color of the indicator becomes blue? Isn't the color corresponding to acid ""red""? Am I misleading something?",1
"I've been watching a lot of your videos lately, thank you.  I'm looking for a video that will explain how to calculate the theoretical pH-value for solutions.  For example, how to calculate the theoretical pH for a 2.5 mmol/L H2PO4- solution and a 5.0 mmol/L NH4+ solution.   There are apparently different formulas based on  strong, middle or weak acids, and for strong, middle or weak bases.  I'm learning it in a language other than English (Danish), which adds to my confusion since I'm not a native Danish speaker.  I'm looking for a good explanation in English.  Do you have a video that teaches this?  Thanks in advance.",1

Is there a continuing lecture?,1
"@ 40:38  Intuitively, it appears taking two electrons from two copper atoms (one from each 4s orbital) is easier than plucking two electrons from 4s orbital of a single Zinc atom ( to form Zn2+). In this case where one copper atom has to lose only one electron to reach stable configuration, It appears like two copper atoms combined, can easily achieve +2 oxidation state than a single Zinc atom (which has to lose 2 electrons from the same atom). Also, compared to copper zinc has an excess proton, so the (second) ionization potential should be more to from Zn2+.   I could be wrong. Can someone please explain why this doesn't happen?",1
