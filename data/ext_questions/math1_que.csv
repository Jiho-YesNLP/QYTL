these teenagers are 40 now. crazy how time flies,1
Did you get into MIT?,1
   krl vc vem do futuro?,1
"   HAHAHAHA nao, só quer dizer que eu me formo em 2024. tipo, essa turma ai dessa aula entrou em 2007 então eles são class of 2010",1
How was your experience with 18.02?,1
"Did anyone add 2024 just got done? Beautifully explained concepts with such practical examples! Couldn't thanks MIT OCW along with Prof Jerison and Prof Muller enough.
India, 2024.",1
wouldnt it be called maclaurin series if the taylor series is centered at 0?,1
 Do you have any idea how many grammatical errors there are in that one paragraph?,1
"Now that I have completed this course, am I considered to have taken calculus 1&2 or just calculus 1?
I wanna know what the next step for me IS.",1
"Completed the course, thanks MIT OCW & prof. David Jerison.  I couldn’t find any bibliography listed in their webpage. What book is recommended for this course?",1
i'm following 18.01SC course and there is no mention of error functions. Where is this explained?,1
Glad to have finished this topic. Can someone provide me the link of next topic which I should cover.,1
Why don't they just use the ratio test to find the radius of convergence?,1
Hi how many total lectures are their in 18.01 and how many are skipped over because of exams mitocw?,1
why the heck does he looks like shakes pear!?,1
Thx for that video. How you see the patterns for series?,1
"hii, i would like to ask if i can find the sigma notation ‘E’ with using only the series, if that makes sense. for example. (2,4,6,8,10) i have to find the ‘E’ of this series. is there a formula to find a sigma notation with using only the series?",1
Would you mind adding this to the calculus playlist??? I was wondering why I hadn't watched this before!,1
How do we determine the lower limit?,1
when i have the sigam notation i always use i in stead of n is this a problem ?,1
One question. What does i=1(for example) under sigma means???,1
"Your explanation of e was really cool! Can you make a really in-depth video about e? I feel like it's everywhere, but still kind of mystifying. The same with ln.",1
Professor Dave for the first comprehension question can the answer be :: an-1 +3?,1
Might I mention how truthfully based it is that Dave teaches sequences so early? I didn't these things in college and they feel largely out of place in their conceptual simply being introduced after limits...,1
Could you do some multivariable calculus?,1
Thanks for the video. I'm a little confused at 2:20 . How does 2 * 3  to the N power - 1 give us 18 or 54?. Is N the term number?,1
What is the capitalised pi notation? I heard it’s used for summation as well,1
"6:09 How do you know what a1, a2, ... is equal to if it wasn't specified?",1
"Professor Dave Explains Thanks,professor!!!!! Are you going to make a tutorial about capital pi???",1
Straight away I’m lost. What is a sub n?,1
"Can e be expressed like this?
∞
Σ (1/n!)
n=1",1
whats the point of me going to school if i can learn this easier by watching a 5 minute youtube video,1
......isnt the x coefficient in standard form supposed to be positive not negative ???????????????,1
Ok this has me messed up at the end. Someone please help. 2nd comprehension I got -6x+3y=21 which I simplified to -2x+y=7 because everything is divisible by 3. It looks like you forgot to divide on the y term because it still says 3y? Shouldnt that just be y?,1
Did you make it 🌚,1
   How'd you do,1
"Hey guys,
Does anyone know the reason why the coefficients have to be in integer multiples?
I tried them as fractions, put in values for x and y, and got the same value for the other variable.
Also,
Why does the coefficient of the x value have to be positive, according to google?",1
What ?? Can A be a negative in standard form Ax+By=C,1
Wheter its standard form or the y=mx+b if it has fractions you divide the numbers and round them off and thats the answer?,1
why is this guy better at teaching math than my math teacher,1
why does y=2 in the beginning?,1
ok but how do we find the standard form from 2 points?,1
what if you've got the points already and you need to convert it into that,1
"For 6y = 12, does it become 2 because we divide by 6?",1
why is my techers torturing me with so much homework,1
WHY IS NOBODY EVEN EXPLAINING WHAT IM SEARCHING UP,1
What are you searching up?,1
why won't the rest be uploaded?,1
Isn't this knowledge considered as a prerequisite to be adimitted to MIT? In UK this stuff is taught to 15 y.o. GCE students.,1
How can this lecture be SO much better than what I see at the university! Everything is so clear and concise.,1
"Hi, when is the rest going to be uploaded?

THANK YOU MIT
I Passed Calc 1, now awaiting Calc 2 integration.

Best supplementary lesson.",1
"​   Dude, what are you doing here when there are Turkish academics =D",1
"   OMG I can't believe you replied to me. This is so cool you have a PHD in mathematics. I am a high school student and I also want to do phd in mathematics and eventually become a mathematician or a theoretical physicist.
Any advice or life experiences you would like to share?",1
​  Do you remember you watched this 8 years ago ? . Are you alive ? Reply man . Are you married and have kids now ?,1
"whate beautiful chalk. my teachers here have flimsy chalk that breaks with every use, they go through a box each class (3hs).",1
"At 28:50 he says, this is a key fact we deduced from Mean Value Theorem (MVT). I don't see how it is so. Can someone explain?",1
at 35:35 if we take derivative of the answer that is not going to be x^3(x^4+2). we need x^4 multiplied by (x^4+2)^6. Can anyone explain what is going on?,1
"I don't understand how David Jerison can take the natural log of a negative number, the domain of the function doesn't exist for negative numbers. Am I missing something?",1
Do we also need to take absolute value of x at 48:22?,1
"He defines dy by using dx, but what is the formal definition of dx???",1
"I can't understand, how?",1
 what about it? I don't see anything bad in that. It doesn't effect the teaching so what's the harm?,1
What came first? The differential or the Leibniz notation?,1
What is the professor's name ?,1
48:07 why du/u = ln u?,1
whats wrong with the cameraman this lec.,1
why is there a dislike -.-,1
"   yeah, that guy probably claimed that Indian students were smarter, wait, can anyone remind me the no. of medals India has in comparison to Us/China? (Referring to IPHO, IMO etc.)",1
At the example at 4:38 the number 1/5 = 0.2 and 4/12 = 0.3 which is larger. The terms don't get smaller. How can this series converge?,1
What is the use of series?,1
"How do you pronounce the difference among ""p"", ""п"", and ""π"", when discussing mathematics in your language?",1

wow what an explanation my teacher took 45 min to explain this to me,1
Elaborate sir. 35% can also be 35/100. How did you figure out that you needed to divide 35 with 5 ?,1
"Hi 
sir this pranesh over here how do we convert numbers like 35 58 into percentage fraction and decimal ?",1
Show eg like what percentage is 2500 of 12000,1
"If you are still looking for an answer, could you clarify your question? Do you mean the whole numbers 35 and 58 as percentage, fraction and decimal?",1
How did you get 7/10 and 0.8?,1

"In his second example, Strang says he is ""freeing up the other end (at x=0)"" and then writes the mathematical condition du/dx = 0 (at x=0). Is he just saying that he wants to impose the condition that no force is acting at the beam at x=0 (i.e. like a cable lying on the floor at x=0)?",1
The way the equation is at 33:16 to solve for U1 to U5 doesn't give the right answer for U1 and U5 since the difference equation for the end isn't complete. (It's just 2 -1 and -1 2). Isn't that right?,1

I suggest arctan and even not atan as I've seen you using atan earlier in the meaning of a * tan as you told me that multiplication was implied on adjacent terms.

Based from the combination with repetition formula -> 11C2 = 55
Pink and Blue -> 12
Pink and Black -> 8
Pink and Brow -> 4
Blue and Black -> 6
Blue and Brown -> 3
Black and Brown -> 2
Pink, Pink -> 10
Blue, Blue -> 6
Black, Black -> 3
Brown,Brown -> 1
which all totals to 55, Am I on track or completely off track? or do I use the other formula?
so for example pink and blue to convert it into percent its going to be 
(12/55) x 100 = 21.81 percent ish of getting it


or is it going to be 
pink and blue example
(4/10 x 3/10) X 100 =12 percent of getting it??

1) typo at 46:03 in the notation of the matrix A. 
2) Note that transformations exist regardless of the basis, and so do vectors. If a transformation is given, the numbers consistuting the transformation matrix change as we change the basis, but the transformation itself does not change, and also the eigenvectors themselves(_not_ the numbers constituting them which change as the basis changes) do not change. How about the eigenvalues? - They stay the same regardless of the basis. Also think about the similar matrices - they share the same eigenvalues. Now you get the idea.

To understand my point, imagine you have a 2d triangle with
a²+b²=c²
c²=√(a²+b²)

However. If you added a third variable, z. It shouldn't affect the result of c. You're only expanding the triangle into a different dimension. This new value it obtains shouldn't even remotely affect the 2d size. ??so why is it doing exactly that?😊",1

25:11 I didn't understand this concept . Can anyone explain this in the comments.,1
"+Buildbox tutorials In the case of matrix spaces, I like to think of dimension as something like ""degrees of freedom"" for ease of understanding. In other words, to find the dimension of a matrix space, I might ask myself something like ""for how many entires of the matrix am I allowed to choose any value?"". In the case of 3x3 symmetric matrices, I can choose any values I like on the 3 diagonal entries because this will have no effect on the symmetry of the matrix, so that gives me 3 ""degrees of freedom"". I can also choose any values I like for the 3 entries above the diagonal, so there's another 3 ""degrees of freedom"". But at this point, I no longer have choices. If I want my matrix to be symmetric, my 3 entries below the diagonal MUST be the same as the 3 above the diagonal. So, in total, I have a freedom of choice over 6 total entries in the matrix and therefore, my matrix space has dimension = 6. (Note: I could have also chosen the 3 entries below the diagonal thereby fixing the 3 entries above as well). Does that clear it up at all?",1

Backing up at 10 mph = -10 mph
Rebounding at half my original speed = multiply by -1/2

mostly the second derivative partial derivative is symmetric isn't it?,1
"This isn't 'multiplication' of derivatives, it's application of two operators (the y-partial and the x-partial) to a function. As these operators don't always commute, order does matter. In many cases the two end up being the same (i.e. for nice functions these operators commute), but the notation must be kept consistent so you know what's being talked about in the not-so-nice cases. 

f_xy means apply the x-partial first, then the y partial since this notation means (f_x)_y.

d2f/(dx dy) means d/dx [ d/dy [ f ] ], which applies the y-partial first.

if you know it spans and number of vectors > number of dimensions, it can't be a basis.
if you know it spans and number of vectors = number of dimensions, it MUST be a basis.
if you know number of vectors < number of dimensions, it can't span?

24:15 is my favorite part so far just for the fact that I chose 3 in my head and so did the professor some people have an easier time with numbers other with letters in the end they're just symbols by which we can communicate and calculate formulas.

On the interior of an O’Neill cylinder, couldn’t you just put everything on a grid and have a machine that takes pictures every day, plug in the values, that way It can give you each rate of change or delta, or lack there of. Hopefully?

Also, It could give you the slope, and delta over a period of time, that way you know your ground better before you build - you’re essentially building on a slope, and whether you’re tapped down or plugged in an interface, you need these numbers and equations to keep track and in case of an emergency.

Also, you can calculate the horizon and what it would look like from the top of buildings in that cylinder 10,000 feet in diameter, 80,000 feet long, and so on)",1

MIT is probably the best technical university, but the way of teaching which lecturer shows isn't good. Maths requires talking about the problem and solving it together. The lecturer should ask student what to do in some examples.

Professor Gilbert Strang
Do you think it is too late to learn?
If it is such an extensive and complex discipline",1
Wow Mr Strang! He looks so old now.. Why does a gem of a person like that have to age? 😕,1
"1. Who is Gilbert Strang?
- Gilbert Strang is a mathematician and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

2. What is the goal of Strang's teaching method?
- The goal of Strang's teaching method is to help students think through problems, rather than simply presenting solutions. He believes that giving students time and encouraging them to think with him is crucial for their learning.

3. How does Strang use humor in his teaching?
- Strang uses humor to make the learning experience more human and relatable. He believes that seeing mathematics as a natural and approachable subject can help students engage with it better.

4. How does Strang decide when to go into detail when teaching complex material?
- Strang tries to think through the material and recognize the words and steps needed to convey it effectively. He also pays attention to the thinking of the class and adjusts his approach accordingly.

5. Does Strang ever encounter difficulties while demonstrating problems in real-time during lectures?
- Yes, Strang sometimes gets stuck or loses the thread while working through problems in real-time. However, he sees this as an opportunity for students to see how to work through difficulties and find solutions, just as they will need to do in their own studies.",1

Wallop Wallop absolutely false. Diversification has been proven time and time again to be the best way to provide optimized returns for a given level of risk. Investing in individual stocks is uncompensated risk. This unsystematic risk is effectively eliminated when properly diversifying across sectors and size and value factors. Do what you want but academic research consistently points to diversification and using factors as a determinant in allocation for that diversification,1
"Connor Matlock exactly man, good to see your perspective too, it seems like we were more or less on the same page from the start, we just misinterpreted each other’s beliefs.

Do you balance your portfolio with the likes of gold and bonds out of interest? An all weather approach for example? I’m not asking for advice necessarily but I’m 17 and have the power of compounding on my side and the luck of coming across the concept early (as I’m sure you do as well), so it may be worth DCA over the long-term. I’ve proven I can stomach the dips I think in this recent drawdown, but it might be a different story when my house or car depends on it! 

The issue I have is that there is just no best strategy. If there was, we’d all be millionaires. It’s finding one, I think, that you can put, say, 90% of your portfolio in, and then using 10% as ‘fun’ money to practice other asset allocations etc. I’m favouring the idea of 85% stocks for the long term and 15% inflation linked bonds as a hedger, but maybe if I’m DCA 100% stocks is the best for my age.

How on earth is this better than reading 10-k reports and waiting for the market to mis-price your favorite businesses so you can buy them below intrinsic value?

How do you invest your portfolio in 2015? Definitely all in bitcoin :D,1
"All of this is only true if you Know the return of an asset in X years. 1. Who told you the return will be Positive at all? Wishful thinking?...
He says R1=R2 while they are negatively correlated, and he says that the final return is R=R1=R2. But if a 1 negatively correlated asset goes up, the other for sure goes down, that's the definition of negative correlation. So 1 goes up by $10, the other goes down by $10. Then how could you have the same return? Looks like your return will be 0 if you put 50/50 weights...

A fourth equation would appear dependent, or make a solution impossible. Is that the point? While b could have been any thing had there been four variables, but constrained when there are only three variables.
Edited: I get it. b can not be any thing arbitrary. Unless it is in the column space of A, there can be no solution.",1
"I got a question, why A is an R⁴ subspace when we got 3 different unknowns. shouldn't that be R³?",1
so far the examples given for subspaces are all n+1 * n matrix. How comes that? Is it just a coincidence or does the 'missing' column represents zero vector?,1

"​   Doesn't that depend on how the fat tailed distribution look? 
The probability for a extremely large loss are indeed higher in a fat tailed distribution. But it can still be more likely for a 2,33 sigma loss in a normal. 

For example, 2 distributions, one normal and one fat tailed with the same mean and variance. Both have 1000 observations. In the normal it will be approx 10 events outside 2,33 sigma, but in the fat tailed it can in the extreme case be 1. If that observation is far enough out in the tail, like 15-20 sigma, then the distributions can still have the same variance. Thus the probability of a 2,33 sigma loss is smaller in the fat tailed.

   Hi Kenneth. In uk the business accounts are insured for max 85K. This is nothing for companies depositing millions. How would you act in this case? I'm not sure the deposit insurance might be considered as parameter here. Maybe assessing the financial soundness of the Bank itself included PD? even in this case I cannot identify a risk matrix to say 5 millions are safest than 15,1

"Is there is a mistake here??
The base 'e' initially defined at 14:15 was never referred to as natural number, and it was only supposed be some base for which the derivative of e^x is e^x because its slope at x=0 is assumed to be 1. This was never proved. Later on (at 24:30) it was just stated as a fact that e, the natural number, is really that base and that its slope at x=0 is 1. I thought the idea here was to prove the derivative of a^x by proving derivative of e^x, where e = natural number. What am I missing?",1
"people shouldn't at 46:39 it should be e^0 since the limit is equal to 0. If you use direct substitution you get that 1/any number approaching infiniti will always be equal to 0, and so 1+ that is 1. Therefore, 1 to any power=1, and so you get ln1. That is 0 since e^o=1.

"Curious - what does using the ""curly d"" really add here?  Could we not have done exactly the same thing using the standard d/dx, d/dy notation?

What (I think) I am trying to say is that since we know we're dealing with a multivariable function, is it even possible that the standard d/dx (etc) notation could be misunderstood as referring to the ""derivative of the whole function"" even if that made any sense? 

The gradient sort of does that, so if we're looking at derivatives w.r.t. x and y, what do we gain in the intermediate steps by changing to ""curly d""s?

Or am I overthinking this, and we use curly ds purely as a label to remind ourselves that we're in a multivariable problem?  Seems odd, should you need reminding if you're at this level of calculus!? 🤔",1

Thank You. Finally a person here who can accept the teaching without bags of candy and or allusions to American movie stars.  Not every teacher needs to be highly extroverted and a comedian and taking selfies every five minutes.  I feel like many of negative comments here show repressed desire from the student to teacher for forbidden intimate physical contact.  It would be nice if these extrovert addicts would tone down their  affliction for a moment.  What will the negative comment generators be like in 20 years?,1

   where are you now?,1
"I never really got the whole picture thing even until now. Does it give any conceptual meaning beyond the definitions embodied by it? Or it is merely a memory aid to remember the definitions? The definitions embodied are:
For any m by n matrix A - row space and nullspace are orthogonal complements in Rn, column space and left nullspace are orthogonal complements in Rm.

i.e. does it supply meaning to the 4 subspaces the way a graph would supply meaning to a function? From what I see, no... Or am I missing something?",1

"​   Well. I think Professor is right. It depends on what 'elsewhere"" means. Since the projection matrix projects onto the column space of A. Column space and left null space both span the whole R^m. Right?",1
"Only when A is invertible can that projection matrix equals to identity. Since A is invertible, it has n independent columns. What happened when you project a vector into a subspace where the vector is actually inside it? The projection matrix is the identity, isn't it? It's like the least square problem AX=b where b is in the column space.",1

"I suppose that not asking questions during the video taping of the lectures was an agreement with the students to make the video time efficient, this is, to be fitted in an hour . He has stated on different videos that students approached him after the lecture (and the taping) was over.
As for introverts/extroverts, technical topics like math, basic sciences (physics and chemistry), machines and computers tend to attract introverts, it is not uncommon though to see extroverts on those fields. On the reverse, you see less introverts in MBAs which more commonly  attract extrovert personalities.

Can somebody tell me if I'm wrong about this?",1

"25:17 Is it necessary for those vectors to be orthogonal to satisfy the projection?

Is there any theorem stating that A(T)*A is always a non negative defined symmetric matrix?

"Hot off the presses : We can pair every positive floating point number 
using up only about 20% of the integers 

Algorithm #1 : Convert a float with a zero whole part into an integer

1. Reverse the character sequence representing this float
2. Remove the decimal point to obtain the desired integer

Example :  Convert the float 0.002743 into its integer equivalent
1. Reverse the float string to obtain 347200.0
2. Remove the decimal point to obtain the integer 3472000 
3. Note : All corresponding integers will be terminated by the character  “0”

Algorithm #2 : Convert a float with a non-zero whole part into an integer

1. Count the number of whole digits or NWD (those preceding the decimal point ) 
2. Append a number of  “0” digits equal to NWD to the float. 
3. Append a digit “1”  to the resulting float
4. Remove the decimal point to obtain the desired integer

Example : Convert the float  1230.0098 into its integer equivalent 
1. Count the number of whole digits : NWD = 4
2. Append NWD = 4  “0” digits to obtain 1230.00980000
3. Append a digit “1”  to obtain 1230.009800001
4. Remove the decimal point : this gives us the final integer of 1230009800001

Note : We append a digit “1”  to distinguish the integers derived from floats with 
non-zero whole parts from integers generated by floats with zero whole parts .

This can be done for every  float [whole.fraction]  where whole  >  0  !!! AMAZING!!! 
We just came up with a scheme which pairs each positive float with a positive integer.

a) Theoretical. For this part start learning statistics. Most day-to-day tasks are kind of related to statistics. 
b) Technical. For this part learn:
   i) Python [Python + pandas + numpy]
   ii) Machine learning. Here you will need mathematics [this channel is one of the bests] and at the same time learn the Sk-learn package for python.
In general, you need math if you want to go be able to customize algorithms for different scenarios. 
What mathematics do you need?
- Algebra [basics]
- Linear Algebra [Vector/matrix]
- Calculus

then, (P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (U2)
then, (P3)(E3)(P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (U3)
... so on ....
finally, (Pn)(En)...(P3)(E3)(P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (Un) = (U)

"1:57:45 these particular solutions can't really exist no? if there are two free variables, then the last 2 numbers in the particular solution vector has to be zeros. Is that true?


About the plane in this example: the original system of equation that produced this solution set has 3 total variables, two of them are free variables, so this system has only 1 linearly independent basis vector. Which means this system is a transformation of the 3D space into a 1D line that exists in the 3D space and points in the direction of the basis vector. Basically it squashes the 3D space into a line. 

So can we think of the plane created by the solution set as ""scanning"" the 3D space as the particular vector changes? The particular vector will change if we leave the left side (representing the matrix) of the equation alone, and only change the numbers on the right side (representing a vector after transformation), not all numbers (vectors) will be valid in this case, as many will be outside the span of the matrix, but there are infinitely many that are within the span and are valid.

SO. Each and every single vector within the span of this matrix (the line cutting through 3D space) has an entire infinite plane of vectors that were all ""squashed"" down or mapped into it. And the particular solution simply leads you to this plane of vectors... so you can imagine all of the 3D space as infinitely many planes that were all transformed/squished into the infinitely many vectors of this line..

"Why the divergent harmonic series cannot proof Zeno Paradox of movement? Why is proved with the series of 1/2^n and not with that of 1/n if both sequences tends to 0 ? Ok series 1/2^n is convergent and our harmonic divergent, but if Zeno asked for 1/2, 1/3 ,1/4, 1/5 ,...,1/n to the destination, this divergent is  one case Against the other convergent used to proof of movement. Is not a ""math cheat"" choose one sequence convenient to the proof without explain why others are not valid AGAINST that choosen? If the answer is only :""divergent is infinite sum"" this gives reason to Zeno, as he have one valid infinite sum against that convergent proof. Who wins? I think have math answer to this, but post my initial fair though. PS: i see in the convergent as in each step summing 1/2^n to the acquired also remains 1/2^n to destination, as in the harmonic summing 1/n to the acquired remains (1-1/n) to destination.",1

Does anyone know of other professors like this? I truly dislike the professor who rambles on endlessly without writing a thing on the board and expecting students to figure out for themselves what is and what isn't important enough to be written down.

So, an axiom set is complete if every proposition can be proved as true or false. But wasn't a proposition something which is true/false by definition. So are these two definitions (i.e. complete axiom and proposition) inter-dependent i.e. an axiom set is complete if it can prove all propositions as true/false AND every statement that can be proved as true/false by an axiom is a proposition?

You are probably thinking of the 3-4-5 special case of a right triangle that meets the Pythagorean theorem with three integers.  Given a base of 4 cm and a height of 3 cm, you'll get a hypotenuse of 5 cm.   The sine of the angle with the base will be 3cm/5cm which equals 0.6.  The cosine of the angle with the base will be 4cm/5cm which equals 0.8.  It is the ratios of the height and base to the hypotenuse.  Does this answer your question?",1

"Great video! I love this series. In this lecture, Dr. Strang briefly mentions that the cost of operations for the det(A) will be (n!) He also shows us how the cost of getting A into upper triangular form U will be (1/3)n^3. But from Lecture 2 we know that one way of finding det(A) is to get A into U and then simply find the product of all n pivots. So it seems like the cost for finding det(A) would just be a bit more than (1/3)n^3, perhaps (1/3)n^3 + n. I must be missing something here; any thoughts?",1

Why the number of operation is equal to n^2 ? Can anyone ?,1
"26:10

I have a question about the cost of elimination.
Ax=b

For an nxn matrix A
For the 1st pivot, instead of 100^2, shouldn’t it cost 100*99?
2nd pivot, instead of 99^2, shouldn’t it cost 99*98?
3rd pivot, instead of 98^2, shouldn’t it cost 98*87?

So, instead of n^2+(n-1)^2+(n-2)^2+...., shouldn’t it be n(n-1)+(n-1)(n-2)+(n-2)(n-3)+.... instead?


Also, how did he get n^2 for the matrix b?",1

"at 32:35 => Should not the first cost be 99*2 instead of 100^2 because there are 99 rows below first one. For pivoting each row below, you need to multiply the first row by some constant then subtract from the row you are pivoting. So, essentially are we not ending up having 2 operations per row for those 99 rows, hence, 99*2 instead of 100^2 ???",1

+Érchegyi Dávid Or does m have to be the greatest common divisor of a and b?,1
"First, for the in-class problem, we had a 5-gallon jug and a 3-gallon jug (you said we had a 4-gallon jug and a 3-gallon jug, but I guess it's a typing mistake).

The problem he proved is

""If m is a common divisor of a and b, then m is a common divisor of any result of the game""

For the 5-jug/3-jug problem, we have that the ONLY common divisor for 5 and 3 is 1. So, any multiple of 1 (smaller or equal than 5, obviously) would be a reachable result for the game.

Now, for the 33-jug/55-jug problem, we have many common divisors and ALL OF THEM should satisfy the theorem. 

You're right, 1 is a common divisor of 55 and 33, and also divides 4. However, 11 divides 55 and 33 but does not divide 4, therefore, 4 is not a possible result for the 55/33 game. QED.

Did it help?",1
"   ""Now, for the 33-jug/55-jug problem, we have many common divisors and ALL OF THEM should satisfy the theorem."" This is a good explanation.

What........... Number theory is a study of integers,1
What happened to the other professor?,1
"In the lecture, he proved the theorem

""If [ m|a AND m|b ], then [ m | any result ]"".

By ""any result"", he means any state ( x , y ) of the game.

(So, if [ m | any result ], then [ m|x AND m|y ] ).

In your question, let's say,  a = 6 and b = 3. Also, we want to get 4 gallons in the 6-gallon jug, therefore, we want to reach the state x = 4. 

Following the theorem, any number m, which divides a and b, must also divide x.

In this case, 3 divides a = 6 and b = 3 but does not divide x = 4. Therefore, x = 4 is not a feasible result. Namely, it is not possible to reach x = 4 in any state of the game. QED.

If I have another matrix with 3 linear equations that use the variables u and v, one column has all u’s and the other has all v’s. If I multiply the two systems of equations using matrix multiplication, the first entry has me adding an x*u to a y*u to a z*u, and I assume that I can just add the constant coefficients together.

"Can someone help me out with something, whether I'm think about this correctly? He seems to prove that for each t, the brownian motion is non-differentiable wp1, which is different from the third property he writes on the board that brownian motions are nowhere differentiable wp1. What he proves is that after fixing a t, the collection of paths that are not differentiable at that particular t is measure 1. If this collection of paths were the same for each t, then you'd get a full measure set of paths that are nowhere differentiable. But if for each t you get a different measure zero set of paths that are differentiable at t, since there are uncountably many t, the union of these measure 0 sets is not necessarily measure 0. This would imply that the set of nowhere differentiable paths is not measure one... so it seems like he proved something different from what he wrote. Is that right?",1

"It took me some time to convince myself why As has two identical rows. The example only shows an example of 2x2 matrix, but the question of why is still there.  Someone helps explain this? 


I have a thought on this. We know that the reduced row echelon form of A has no more than 1 of ""1"" at each row and cols. If we multiply a row of A (let's say the 1st row) with a col of C^T (let's say 2nd col), we get 0 because each co-factor matrix in 2nd col of C^T (e.g. C21) always consist a zero vector. (C21 consists of zero vector of col  1 of A). Thus, their product is 0. 

Is it the right thought?",1

"so from the comments I've gathered that the boundaries are taken as is in the question (0<x<2) and (0<y<2). However, this doesn't make sense because the surface equation z = x^2 + y^2 describes a cone-like shape, and if there's a box that contains some of this with the given boundaries, when you project it in the XY plane you get a quadrant line so the y boundary I calculated as; 0 to 4 -  x^2. Have I visualized the problem wrong? My final answer was ~28 and the answer you give is ~21, so pretty similar but I guess that doesn't mean anything if I've visualized it wrong?

What's different have n and no n?,1
"how do you figure out r=<x,y,1-x-y> at 3:43??",1
"Summary:
- We have F, some vector space <a, b, c>, where a, b, and c can each contain x, y, and z.
- We have C, which is the boundary of our surface, some equation involving x, y, and z.
- We have r, <x, y, {x, y}>, where {x, y} is z in terms of x and or y [isolate z from our curve equation]

1) Find the curl: Del x F
2) Find the normal vector of our plane surface: d/dx (r) x d/dy (r)  

3) Dot product 1) and 2) 
4) Take the double integral of 3. Look at the surface x and y span, may need to sketch it out. If they are not constant (like the box at the end's sample problem), you will need to find x in terms of y or y in terms of x depending on which you want to integrate first.


The part I'm least sure about is 4. In the main example, we have x + y + z = 1, and use (1, 0) and (0, 1). The reason we ignore z seems to be because we already have the integral in terms of x and y. Let's say we have ax + by + cz = d. More simply, we use ax + by = d. It seems like the points we use for the sketch is where the other variable = 0, or ax = d, or by = d. 

Idk if that is even right tho, is it? and what about other cases, too--besides something where its just constants for x and y like the sample prob at the end [And assuming the graphs of them are not just given to you to make it easy to see]

OH and how do we calc whether or not it is positively oriented",1

"Good work. But 9 over 9 (9/9) equals 1 not 0.9999... , right?",1
"    first, I want to thank you for responding.  
And hopefully we can dialogue about this just for a bit. 

So, You mention integers, and whole numbers.   
Well, let’s talk about that; what are the various classifications of numbers.  
Off the top of my head. 
1:  Natural numbers:   Are the counting numbers.  But exclude zero, fractions/decimals and negative numbers.  Probably because it’s more empirical, where zero and negative numbers are more abstract. 

2:  Whole numbers:  This includes the natural numbers and also includes zero.   but still excludes fractions, decimals and negatives 

3: Integers:  include what it means to be natural and whole numbers, but also includes negatives. But still excludes fractions and decimals. 

4: Rational numbers: I thought included all of the above but also includes fractions and decimals. 

But you say that “rational numbers can be expressed by integers”

My thought of an integer includes whole numbers and negatives, but not fractions/decimals. 

But let me stop there.  Do you agree with the definitions above?",1
Just to clarify: Do I only conjugate if there's an irrational number in the denominator?,1
"Do irrational numbers really exist? Because even if you can't calculate the exact number, obviously circles do exist and...well I'm not sure how else to say it but circles exist and they have boundaries.",1

"Professor Strang mentions that U and V form bases for the four fundamental subspaces of A, but it's not clear to me how C(A) = C(Ur) and C(A') = C (Vr'). I know that U and V were determined by the eigenvectors of AA' and A'A, respectively, but how are these related to the column and row spaces of A?",1
" if A is a matrix of m x n, (m rows and n columns)
Each row vector is in Rn  space. There are m rows.
Each column vector is in Rm space. There are n columns.

Then shouldn't Vi be from v1 to vm ? and not vn? Since there are m rows?",1
Why so few people at the lecture?,1
"This is how I see it.
Suppose A is m by n, it means that row vectors are n-dimensional.
When we write Ax = b, x is also an n-dimensional vector, and it lives either in a row space of A or in a null space of A, if exists (Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra). On the other hand, b lives in the column space of A (or left null space of A, if exists).
So, when we start from A*v = sigma*u (in the matrix form: A = U * Sigma * V'), v is in the row space, and u is in the column space. Then come the clever steps to determine what are u and v with the use of A'A and AA'.

"clyton dantis  Imagine having the equation x + z + w = 2 and  y - 2w =0. What values of x,y,z and w can solve both equations? Well if you only had to solve the first equation then there are an infinite number of solutions for x,z and w. 
But when you include the second equation you are limiting the values that w can take on, though this will still not stop you from having an infinite number of solutions since YOU have the power to choose any value for w. Simply add 2w to both sides and you will get that y = 2w. Thus, your value y ,which can be associated with a pivot variable, can be anything as long as it is equal to 2w ,which can be interpreted as the ""free"" variable.",1
"Transpose([0 1 -2 1]) 
 is also nullspace....why didn't he include that??",1
"If you think of each row as a  polynomial equation, then the zero pivots mean the coefficients of those variables are zero.  So it doesn't matter what value  you assign the variable, it doesn't change the result.

I think of it this way.  Imagine a straight line going through the X-Y plane of your computer screen.  ax + by = d.  Then imagine that line in 3-D (X-Y-Z) space.  What is the z-coefficient?  The z-coefficient is zero.  a*x + b*y + 0*z = d.  So it doesn't matter what value I use for the variable z because the z-coefficient is zero, and I get the same straight line that never leaves the X-Y plane.  He has an equation with zero coefficients for two of the variables, so he can put any value for those variables without changing the result.

So he just picks the values that make his calculations easier.  You could use other values for the special solution, but it won't change the result because the coefficients are zero.  So he picks 1 for one of the zero pivot variables to make his calculations easier by yielding the identity matrix, and he picks zero for the rest of the zero-pivot variables just to get rid of them.

I think if he had three zero pivots, then he'd pick [1,0,0] or a variation of that.  For four zero pivots, he'd pick [1,0,0,0], and so forth.  One value for the special solution would be 1 to get the identity matrix, and all the rest would be zeros.

I've gotten that far, but I still don't get what happens after he has the identity matrix.",1

What the hell kind of multivariable calculus course is this? thats 3 full lectures on vectors and 1 so far on matrices...,1
"x+y+3z=5
is the equation of a plane ..
Then you find normal vector from that equation
which is perpendicular to the plane..
So maybe the equation of that normal vector is
x+y+3z=0
Then normal vector to the plane is
N=<1,1,3>
Then do dot product between N and Z
If it is 0 then it is perpendicular to N and thus Z is parallel with the plane x+y+3z=5
People might be mistaken ..
Ah just do dot product between Z and <1,1,3> ..ah it's 0 so it must be perpendicular to the plane x+y+3z=5
And doest not realized <1,1,3> the normal vector of plane x+y+3z=5..
I don't really understand this..
Because what does x+y+3z=0
Represents?
Is it perpendicular to x+y+3z=5?
It must be not true
Because the planes must be parallel to each other because the coefficient of x,y,z are similar
Maybe the way he gets the normal vector is weird but it is what it is",1

WHY do all the 3rd order and higher terms in the Taylor expansion for Ito's lemma all disappear??,1
"Let's start at the basics: why do the 2nd order terms and above vanish so that 
f(x+dx) = f(x)+f'(x)dx
(here I'm treating dx like an infintesimal, but if you want to make it standard just add the limits)?

Answer: because for a smooth function, the linear approximation using the slope is good enough in the limit. It also has bounded variation as a function.

So why isn't that good enough for Ito's lemma?
Because the Brownian motion isn't smooth. In fact, as a stochastic process it has quadratic variation. This means that (dB)^2 and dt grow at roughly the same rate. So if we're going to keep the first order terms, then we also have to keep (dB)^2 as well.

So it's not that we're not getting rid of the second order terms and above- we are- it's that we're forced to keep one of them as it contributes as much as a first-order term.

But since it is only quadratic variation, it's safe to throw all the higher order terms away. If your question was ""why do the higher order terms vanish in general"", then that's just because x+(x^n) is basically equal to x for very small x and n>1.",1

What is a theorem that you think is more important/applicable than the ones discussed here?

Now, I do agree that all else being equal, I’d prefer to use a more realistic model when doing some math, but all else is not equal. Often the most accurate model isn’t as elegant or theoretically nice as  some simplified models. Often   these simplified models make for interesting mathematics while being tractable, while sometimes the full detail thing would be intractable.

Though, yes, it is important to recognize when and where a model differs from reality.",1

dudee how's it going cuz samee 🥲👍,1
"1:24:49 The answer is actually 20, right?",1
"video: 5 hrs

ads: are you sure about that?",1
"15:25 That doesn't make sense. If x1<x2 in [-2,1], then f(x1)<f(x2). That means that the function is increasing on [-2,1]. It is not a convention. It is literally the definition of an increasing function.

23:42 What are those sources? It just doesn't satisfy the definition. And once you learn the derivatives, it doesn't satisfy the criterion. It surely is not a stationary point.

26:31 I usually don't care too much about naming, but come on. Absolute is obviously in contrast to relative, and local to global. Calling them absolute and local is weird. :-|

Again, cube and sqrt are drawn very wrong around 0. See my comment on Algebra video about that.

58:24 Your drawing is way off. f(4)=-5, but it seems greater than -4 in your picture. :-o

1:40:15 There are many things wrong here. First, y in the image doesn't seem that close to 100 at all. That's because a 75° angle doesn't look remotely like what you've drawn. :-( The students should be encouraged to check their results by testing them agains the rough feeling for the size of numbers. Second, nice to know you're ignoring the height of the person, it seems right given the input (string length) has only one significant digit (in fact it's just an order of magnitude). But that makes your cm-precise height of a kite completely bogus. Not just the person, the kite itself is larger than 1cm, so it really doesn't make sense.

1:59:35 tan(theta) is not a function, tan is a function. You say it correctly when speaking about sin and cos at 1:58:20 and 1:58:29.

2:03:00 If you partially extract sqrt from 45/49 in the denominator, you should also do so in the numerator. It's 3sqrt5/7, of course.

2:04:27 ""Just sticking a negative sign in front"" really should be better justified. What you just showed with the picture is sin(t)=2/7 implies cos(t)=3sqrt5/7. How does it follow that if sin(t)=-2/7 and cos(t)<0, then cos(t)=-3sqrt5/7? Either back to the Pythagorean property for arbitrary angles, or at least draw two triangles in the coordinate system, in QI and QIII, and argue they are congruent.

2:10:59 Of course not. You should also say that 2pi is the smallest such number, in order for it to be the period.

2:16:13 If you look at my comments on Algebra video, you'll see exactly why is that. You're transforming coordinate systems, not graphs.

2:41:44 But also a number. There is a very weird idea in precalculus, that angle measures are something different than ordinary real numbers. Of course, as soon as you start thinking in terms of calculus, and realize that sin'=cos, the LHS would have to have units number/angle, and the RHS just number, you see there is no other way than just accept that arguments of trigonometric functions are the most mundane real numbers.

2:46:17 It always is (when dealing with a noninjective function). When defining sqrt, we could have picked the negative branch. :-)

2:57:00 Of course not. Same as sqrt(x^2) is not x for all x, arccos(cos t) is not t except when t is between 0 and pi. Yes, you correct yourself later, but ""this gives me"" should already be suspicious.

3:12:15 It's not the same thing. It is the same thing unless cos x is zero. If you really want to define identities as equalities that hold for all values of a variable, then this is not an identity.

3:27:50 Only if A+B is less than pi/2. Other cases require different proofs, it seems.

3:38:17 Or simply x=pi/2+kpi.

3:43:19 That's obviously impossible, since theta is obtuse. You probably meant pi-theta.

3:44:40 I thought it was customary to rationalize the denominators there.

3:49:26 Because theta is inside the domain for restricted cosine. That's why your idea of ""another planet"" where the aliens use a different branch to invert cosine doesn't really hold water: since trig functions are usually used and primarily motivated to solve the triangles, we better make sure that the restricted versions (and their inverses) are useful for that particular case. (Also in 3:58:41 for example.)

3:53:25 Why? Yes, in the same triangle larger angle is opposite to larger side, but those are different triangles. It can probably be proved (without using law of cosines:), but it is in no way obvious.

4:00:54 You should teach students to use calculator's memory for intermediate results! Or at least use ""double the decimals"" rule: calculate everything with 4 decimals, report results with 2 decimals. Otherwise, there will almost always be embarassing accumulation of errors.

4:10:46 Probably b isn't 20 degrees. :-D

4:21:36 Not exactly the same. The distance from y=-p should be the absolute value of y+p, and then it would be the same. In this case, it isn't y+p, but -y-p.

4:22:30 Or you could just swap x and y coordinates in the previous derivation, mirroring the image around y=x line.

4:41:00 You probably mean absolute value of a difference. Otherwise you'd have only one branch.

4:45:53 Not really. The equation below is more general, and holds for both branches, the equation you started with holds only for the right one.

4:47:07 Less known fact, which really gives a nicer characterization: b is the difference from (any) focus to (any) asymptote.

4:49:50 You might want to point out, in contrast to the ellipse and despite all the images you drew, it is not the comparison between the axes that determines the orientation: in the ellipse, a is always bigger, in the hyperbola it doesn't have to be.

4:57:00 All your rs are off by one. The inner circle (r=1) is barely visible, but it's obvious that the one you think is r=1 is not half of radius of the one that you think is r=2.

5:02:33 You're mixing two different notions. One is _explicit equation_, where y=f(x), and another is _implicit equation_, where g(x,y)=0. Both are Cartesian in your sense. Not passing a vertical test is not the reason not to have Cartesian equation, as you yourself show few minutes later. Same mistake on 5:13:10.

5:10:39 A really exaggerated one. It's 6 and 5, not 14 and 5. :-D

5:11:19 We already do have a Cartesian equation for the circle before squaring. And squaring isn't always harmless, though it is in this example since r is positive.",1

"    Wow, I really hope you’re a professor at a community college at best and not a prestigious university like MIT. And I’m not sure what to tell you, your “counterexample” doesn’t disprove anything. I literally wrote out all the math for you in my last comment, look at it and disprove me if you’re so confident about your obviously incorrect notions. Otherwise, I want you to rewatch the video and think about the mathematics, work it out for yourself, and take the time to understand why the professor brought up that headline. And why your “counterexample” is totally, 100% irrelevant. As I already said, taking the Boston Globe’s findings and applying it to your counterexample demonstrates that it only proves the Boston Globe’s headline. And I’ve done all I can to show why that is the case. 

What mathematics field do you teach and where? Normally I would not be so presumptuous as to think I am more capable at math or logic than a professor, but for you I make an exception. You clearly do not understand the point the professor and I are making and your blatant disregard for all the math and explanations I presented in my last comment reflects that.

There would be biases because of the difference in numbers of course, but the study isn't complete trash. Or have I made a mistake?",1
is your daughter at MIT now??,1
"Alright, I agree with them not being comparable.

I may have overlooked something, but I still am seeing something wrong with his proof. When he applies math to get the answer to be the ratio of populations, he says that the average degree of each node on the men's and women's side both equal |E|, and then they cancel out in the division. Wouldn't the average degree only be equal if he is considering the population of people who have been in these partnerships? If he uses the 300 estimate for the population, he is also considering people who have not been in a partnership i.e. degree of 0. The only way now for both degree averages to be the same is if the ratio of 0 degree men to 0 degree women is the exact same ratio of men to women in the population.

"What really made related rates click for me was realizing what we're differentiating with respect to when we solve a problem. What I mean is that I was used to d/dx, but with a related rate problem, you're differentiating X and Y with respect to time. So rather than dy/dx and dx/dx, it's dy/dt and dx/dt",1
"What does it mean to have dV or dr or dt just on its own and not in a derivative fraction?

Here is what I mean. First example can also be solved like this:
dV/dr = 4pi*r^2 --> dV = 4pi*r^2 * dr
dV/dt = 100 --> dV = 100*dt
4pi*r^2 * dr = 100*dt
dr/dt = 100/(4pi*r^2) etc

My question is, what is actually happening when the separate d terms start bouncing around in the expressions? Are they just infinitesimal changes in a variable? It's strange that they can be split off from derivative fractions and recombined to form a different derivative.",1

"Lets suppose you have 2 independent vectors that make the row space. Lets call them vector Q, and R.  Two independent vectors describe a plane. Lets also suppose that you have multiplied or divided Q by what ever number is needed to make vector Q have a leading 1. The next thing you are going to do is to subtract any multiple of vector Q in vector R to get a new second row with no component in the first column. What does this literally mean when you draw vectors Q and R? Draw some vector Q and some vector R through the origin. Now break R into a component parallel to Q and a component perpendicular to Q. IF you subtract whatever multiple of Q from R, your left with that perpendicular component. Notice that these 2 vectors Q and the vector R-kQ are still are in the plane initially made by Q and R.  Swapping the order in which you write the vectors does not change the space spanned by vectors. Taking a multiple of a vector in the row space does not change the space spanned by that vector and the other basis vectors....because....you already can take any multiple and or linear combination of basis vectors to describe the space. 

On the other hand, what do row space operations do to the columns. Suppose you have the first column vector <a,b,c,d> transpose ie write a then b then c then d in a vertical column.  Subtracting some number k times the first row from the second row as you would in row reduction and you have the vector      <0,b-ka, c,d> transpose. This is not the same column vector as <a,b,c,d> transpose.  This problem happens in every column where the component in row 1 is not zero for that column. 

If you wanted to preserve the column space....take A transpose, and do row operations. This is sometimes done for example if you wished to determine if the columns of A are linearly independent OR if you wished to determine a basis for the column space of A with numbers much lower than those used in the original matrix A. 

Can you define a set of operations where you take linear combinations of columns and take those away from other columns in matrix A? You could do that and know that this preserves the column space but not the row space. In working with determinants....both column operations and row operations are allowed before calculating the determinant. Sometimes this will reduce a matrix from something with huge numbers down to a matrix where the determinant can be calculated in your head. You have not yet studied the determinant of a matrix. My point is that it is not that column operations are NEVER done, its just that if you mix column and row operations you must know what changes and if that is what you want. For now just do row operations on A, or row operations on A transpose. Once you are very fluent with those....the book will lead you toward when column operations are appropriate and what that means. 

Question: Could you take a vector....and arbitrarily set one of its components to zero and claim the vector is preserved? Isnt that what you do to column 1 when you take some multiple of row 1 from row 2 Didnt you just set the first component of row 2 of the column 1 vector to zero while leaving all else intact? From the column point of view, row operations allow you to set any component to zero while leaving the other components in the column intact.",1

How to find Maxima and minima of y=x^2+1/x^2,1
"why it's called ""local"" and Is there something like universal Maxima and minima???",1
"Start by determining the domain.  Forget about imaginary numbers, and focus on real numbers only.   What is the minimum x-value, and the maximum x-value that you can plug in to this equation.   In order for the square root to be real, the contents of it need to either be positive or zero.   This means the maximum x^2 can be is 1, which means x ranges from -1 to +1.

However, at these extremes of the domains, we run in to another problem of a zero in the denominator.  So our domain is -1 < x < +1, with exclusions of -1 and +1.

As x approaches these extreme points, the value of the function approaches positive infinity, due to the function being positive just before this, and due to the denominator approaching zero.   So this lets us know that y < infinity is part of the range

Intuitively, something interesting will also happen at x=0.   But we can also prove it by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.  This allows us to calculate that x=0 is a critical point, which might be a minimum or maximum.

d/dx 1/sqrt(1-x^2) = x/(1-x^2)^(3/2)
Which equals zero at x=0

Take the second derivative, to determine if this is a minimum or a maximum.
d^2/dx^2 1/sqrt(1-x^2) = (2*x^2 + 1)/(1-x^2)^(5/2)

Evaluate the second derivative at x=0, and get a positive number, indicating that this is a local minimum.

Now evaluate the original function at x=0, to confirm our minimum value of y.
1/sqrt(1-0^2) = 1

We now can conclude that the range is
1 <= y < infinity",1

Wait! I think I understand now. Derivative is actually the SLOPE OF TANGENT LINE of a function. So when it's 0. That means the tangent line is going horizontally. This means that the function's y value can't be any greater as it is contained by the tangent line. Thus the f(x) is largest when dy/dx =0. Am I babbling??,1

"In the first example using 2400m of fencing the constraint was that the enclosure was to be rectangular with one side being the river, but what if instead of a rectangle the fence was arranged as half a circle with the river being equal to the diameter.  In this case the area enclose would be over 916,000m --nearly 200K more than the rectangle.  One of the problems with questions like this is knowing what the constraints are and in this case the constraint was clearly stated that the enclosure was to be rectangular, but what if that constraint was not specified and the question was:  what would be the greatest area enclosed with 2400m of fencing if some portion of the enclosure was defined by the river.

"why is it that when x is positive, it is the local minima and when x is negative it the local maxima?",1
"Then you investigate the end-points of the domain.   One of those will be the maximum.

As an example.  Two positive integers have a product of 100.   What is the maximum possible sum?

You'll find a critical point at x=10 and y=10, where the sum is 20.  This is a local minimum to solving this problem with calculus.  We were interested in a maximum, rather than a minimum.   But 5 and 20 are another pair of integers whose product is 100, and they add up to 25, which is greater than 20.

To get the maximum sum, we have to look at the end of the domain.   The smallest positive integer is of course 1, and the corresponding other number in our constraint is 100 itself.  1*100 = 100, and 1+100 = 101.   This is our maximum.",1

"   I almost take your point, but ok not rounding out..2.428. You've asked in this video to convert that into a mixed number which is an integer and a fraction. So surely you are in fact asking to convert a decimal answer into a fraction in order to format it as a mixed number (i presume in the same format your video demonstrates, as in (for example) 1 1/3. I'm rubbish at maths so I'm not saying you've done something in error, but you've made no reference to a previous understanding of how you would represent .428 as a fraction as a part of a mixed number (does that make sense?) You've said look at other lessons, but if they come after this one..I'm not sure how I'm expected to know how to do this, therefor, can't solve the problem. if the problem can't be solved then the lesson doesn't demonstrate the use of solving it.

"Don't you see that between the Greeks and the 17th century scientists there is a two thousand year gap, where Europe was living in dark ages while other nations were developing science, machinery, philosophy and arts?
It is impossible that the Greek contribution was waiting for 2000 years till the Europeans wake up, find the Greek books on some shelf waiting for 2000 years, unjust them and take it from there and developed them!
Now I can tell you to go and do your homework to fill the gap before talking about the history of Maths. Still, I can tell you that in this world there are other nations like Chinese,  Indians, Persians and Arabs whose wisdom contributed to mankind knowledge. Indeed, the Europeans were the last to contribute to human knowledge. Besides, the Greeks of that time are not a European nation.

"   One might recall that it was Newton himself who, in 1713, wrote the anonymously-issued official report of the British Royal Society and their supposedly neutral investigation by a responsible committee, into the hoked-up debate over who had first invented the calculus.

If one can prove how gravity works by simply drawing a cycloid, then what is there to stop one from winning all one’s arguments by being the anonymous judge of one’s own debates?",1

Gravity's value is 9,8m/s^2, not 10m/s^2. Hence, the equation is h = 80 - 4,9 t^2 (4,9 is half the acceleration - gravity in this case), and not h = 80 - 5 t^2 as shown. How can a MIT teacher say it's 10m/s^2?
The formula the student asked for is: y = y(initial) + v(initial)t + 1/2 at^2. 
y= position (y at ground level, y(initial) at the top)
v= velocity (zero at the top)
a= acceleration (gravity in this case)

uh, I was under the impression that that was actually a reasonable and common strategy, because, it should match the growth of the total market, and also, one doesn’t have to repeatedly make trades, because as the market caps shift, they will continue to hold them in proportion to the market caps?

So you cant get (1,0,0) from the vectors and certainly not the entirety of R^3, right? The first and second row would even be the exact same written as a Matrix, so they should be linearly dependent for that reason as well.

"Thank you, sir!!! 

It has started with a simple matrix and look it is creating the whole universe, explaining the existence. That's the beauty of it!!!
It feels amazing when I spend my time with the abstract world.
My intuition says ""There is something still hiding and right now you are in the dark place so either you can't get out from that place or you can't stand still"". 

Let's look at these beautiful connections:

A matrix has some columns and these are called vectors. The vectors are independent if their combinations give no zero except if they are zero vectors {How???) and dependent if the opposite of the statement is true. 
What is the connection between independence and null space and the rank of a matrix?
the vector are Independent when the Null space of that matrix = zero vector and
the rank is no of columns (Think !!!) =Invertible = nonsingular matrix.
For dependence of vectors there exists at least one free variable ( Do you know what is free variable?) and rank is less than the number of columns. ( Singular???)

The linear combination of the whole vectors forms space. (Here your existence, experience, can be explained!!! Can you visualize it in your imagination? )

The basis for a vector space is the sequence of all the vectors with two properties
1) They are independent ( look independence again comes here!!!)
2)They span a space ( what is span??? Think!!!) ( What space can be formed from these vectors (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,1,1)? )

The basis!!!  The children of a space!
In a three dimensional space with any two vectors, what is the basis for that space?
(Is it  a plane or a space or a line???)

Every basis for a vector space has the same number of vectors given space and that's called
the dimension of the space. The number of vectors is very important.(why??? Think!!!)

The Dimension of a column and a null space???

The dimension of the column space=The rank of matrix =Number of pivot columns. Remember, it does not depend directly on the dimension of the matrix. 

The dimension of the null space = number of columns - rank of the matrix = The number of free variables.
The basis of the column space is generated from the all the linearly independent vectors of a matrix given a space. If We know the dimension of the space then a couple of vectors that are independent be a basis.

Algorithm
1)Matrix -> row reduced echelon form->no of pivot columns->rank->dimension of column space
2) free columns = no of columns - rank= dimension of the null space.",1

"Providing more clarity on the Horse Problem.
For the Induction Axiom to work, there are two requirements.

1. Base case must be true 
- P(1) is trivially true, because the 1 horse will always be the same color as itself.

2. P(n) => P(n+1)
- So, when we write n horses, we typically write
h(1), h(2), h(3) ....h(n)
& for n+1 horses
h(1), h(2), h(3) ....h(n), h(n+1)

In the above statements, we sub-consciously assume that n is a bigger number greater than 1. Here lies the mistake. Since n can be any number, n can also be 1. So, the list can be:

h(n) -----> for n horses
h(n), h(n+1) -----> for n+1 horses

More specifically:
h(1) -----> for n horses, where n being 1
h(1), h(2) -----> for n+1 horses, where n being 1

Now, as per inductive step, predicate is assumed to be true. 
Assumption: Set of any n horses is of the same color.
=> h(1) is the same color as itself, say color c1
The assumption also implies that h(2) is the same color of itself, say color c2
Now does h(1) => h(2)? i.e. does c1 = c2?
We can't determine that, can we? There is no way we say c1 is always same as c2.
So, the inductive step breaks.

The takeaway from this problem is to remember the ""..."" bug that we sub-consciously tend to make. Hope it helps someone :)",1

"Horse Problem Clarification:
The inductive step doesn’t work when n=1

So P(n) = H1, H2, …, Hn
And P(n+1) = H1, H2, …, Hn, Hn+1

1. We assume P(n) is true by induction
2. In P(n+1), we know that the first n horses are the same color because we assumed P(n) is true
3. Now, remove H1 from P(n+1), you’re left with the set {H2, …, Hn, Hn+1}, which now has P(n) horses
4. So now we know that {H2, …, Hn, Hn+1} are all the same color because again P(n) is true

5.(Now here’s the error) The next step WOULD be to say that H1 = {H2, …, Hn} because of step 1 and {H2, …, Hn} = Hn+1 because of step 4, thus implying that P(n+1) are all the same color,

BUT look closely at case n = 1: 
P(1)= H1
P(2) = H1, H2

Remember step 5: H1 = {H2, …, Hn} = Hn+1

"How does induction work?

This is what i understood :

Let's take the example of this formula

S(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + -------- + n = n(n + 1) / 2

Now suppose I asked you the value of S(100) and you solved it for me 

S(100) = 1 + 2 + 3 + -------- + 100  = 5050

Similarly , You also solved for me f(100) = 100(100 +1) / 2 
                   = 5050

Now, assuming you weren't lying to me about S(100) and I'm required to find S(101), I can do that as follows :

S(101) = [1 + 2 + -------100] + 101 = [5050] + 101  = 5151

f(101) = 101(101 + 1) / 2 = 5151

Similarly If i have to find S(102) and assuming you did'nt lie to me about S(100), I can do 

S(102) = [1 + 2 + 3 +--------- + 101] + 102 = [5151] + 102 = 5253

f(102) = 102(102 + 1) / 2 = 5253

|
|
|
|

Similarly I can keep on calculating it for values greater than 100 (means 100 is the base case here)  based upon the answer you told me...

So here, I'm not verifying the hypothesis, but assuming you verified it for me and using that I proved a conditional statement that

If p(n) holds true then p(n+1) also holds true.

i.e. p(n) => p(n + 1)

And when you check base case you are giving yourself that initial start...(just like you told me that S(100) is true.)..but here solving for the basecase you know its true cuz you verified it yourself...

"You're actually pretty spot on with both speculations. 

If the object was a car then its position graph says that it was (1) stationary, then (2) sped up away from the origin, (3) maintained a speed, (4) slowed to a stop, (5) stayed stationary for some time, (6) slowly sped ""up"" to reverse towards the origin, (7) maintained that speed, and finally (8) abruptly slowed down to a stop at approximately the origin. 

For reference, let each of the points above refer to successive vertices on the second graph. Imagine slicing the three graphs vertically at each of these points:

The second graph describes the car's velocity (or speed) in the same time frame as the position graph.  Simply put, if the car moving forward then its velocity hovers above the x-axis (points 2 to 5) and if it is reversing, then its velocity hovers below the x-axis (points 6 to 8). If there is no change in velocity (intervals where the velocity graph is flat) then the car is either stationary (velocity is zero - points 0 to 1, 5 to 6, 8 to 9) or it is moving at a constant speed (where the velocity graph is flat but not at zero - points 2 to 3, 6 to 7). 

The gradual rise/fall on the velocity graph refers to a change in velocity. Let's try and develop an intuition for why this is true but before we can do that, let's first review mathematics. Recall the definition of a slope: rise/run. When we talk about ""the rate of change"" of a function, we are referring to its slope within some interval. In calculus, this is referred to as the derivative of the function - its slope over an infinitely small interval. The second graph demonstrates the rate of change in position over time and the third graph demonstrates the rate of change in velocity over time; thus, we say that velocity is the first derivative of position and acceleration is its second derivative. But what does all this mathematical jargon actually mean?

We all know from experience that a car cannot just go from rest and magically travel at 60mph at the snap of a finger - it has to speed up from rest and traverse through 1mph, 2mph, 3mph and so on until it reaches 60mph over some time. This gradual change in velocity is just the car's acceleration (""speeding up/down""). Notice the first rising curve in the first graph (points 2 to 3)? Well that section corresponds to: (1) a positive change in velocity (the first rising slope in the second graph) and (2) the first positive ""step"" in the acceleration graph. By interpreting the acceleration vs time graph, we find that the car is speeding up at a constant rate in this interval. The steepness of this slope describes how fast the car is accelerating (speeding up) or decelerating (slowing down) - where a steeper slope = greater acceleration (analyze the first two slopes in the second graph and compare it with the magnitude of acceleration in the third graph). In English, we would describe a steep positive slope in the velocity graph as ""speeding up quickly,"" and conversely, a steep negative slope as ""slowing down quickly."" At the extreme end, we would describe a nearly vertical negative slope as ""abruptly stopping."" 

Notice how language agrees with math - [speeding up] [quickly] = [velocity/time] per [time] = [distance/time] per [time] = [meters/second] per [second] = [m/s]/s = m/s^2. Voila - we have derived the SI units for acceleration using just English!

When the car is speeding up, we should expect: (1) a positive ""step"" in the acceleration graph, (2) a rising slope in the velocity graph, and (3) a rising curve in the position graph. Conversely, if the car is slowing down we should expect: (1) a negative ""step"" in the acceleration graph, (2) a downward slope in the velocity graph, and (3) a flattening curve in the position graph. 

It is also important to keep in mind that while a negative velocity implies that the car is in reverse, a negative acceleration does not imply the same - a negative acceleration just means the magnitude of its velocity (speed) is decreasing relative to the direction of motion - a car can still be moving forward even if its acceleration is negative. Given enough time, a car moving in the positive direction with a negative acceleration will eventually come to a stop. This is evident in points 3 to 4. Moreover, a negative acceleration also does not imply that the car is slowing down. Take points 5 to 6 for example. The car is speeding up but in reverse!

Bonus:
The area under the curve of a velocity graph is the total displacement (vector counterpart of distance) of the car - in this case, by our analysis of the position graph, we can extrapolate this value to be zero which means that the car returned to the origin. By analyzing the geometry of the velocity graph we see that the area (in blue) above the x-axis is approximately the same area below the x-axis. A positive area ""I"" plus a negative area ""I"" equals zero, thus the net displacement of the car is zero. This is yet another relationship between the position and velocity graphs. The same relationship applies to velocity and acceleration. In calculus, displacement (position) is known as the integral of velocity (speed) and velocity is known as the integral of acceleration. In essence, integrals are anti-derivatives *wink*, vice versa.
