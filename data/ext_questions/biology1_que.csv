"Honestly, looking at where we are today, was the guy who tried to kill Reagan really all that paranoid?",1
Are these lectures covering complete thing? Or just an introduction to human behavioral biology.,1
How are those students doing today ?,1
   What doesn't tequila    makes you stronger.,1
"   , are you sure that it was evidence of resurrection, not evidence of not being actually killed?",1
" Kuffar Legion  , Frum... that's some first priest or he is that mystical pilot, they have done strawradio-contact to?",1
"   , wasn't shvirat kelim and all that suff just an unavoidable consequence of the light and the vessel properties?",1
   In all of your comments you give no references to the evidence you claim. Do you know what a reference is?,1
"   I kind of had the opposite experience from you. I was a Christian and avoided looking at the evidence carefully for a long time. And when I finally did look at it with a critical eye, despite being biased heavily in favor of Christianity, I eventually came away not believing in it. I really wanted it to be true and I was very sad that I didn't find justification.

I think the resurrection in particular is a really bad place to start though. Any miracle really, I find it really hard to get around Hume's argument about miracles. Or more particularly, how do you weigh evidence for a natural law being violated. What do you weigh it against? If you look at it in a Bayesian sense, what is your starting probably for a natural law being violated?

If someone looks at my lottery ticket and says it looks like I won the powerball, if I estimate their chance of being wrong as 1 in 1000 and my chance of winning as being 1 in 292,000,000. The chance is overwhelmingly likely that they are just wrong. If I double check and my chances are also 1 in 1000, the chance is still overwhelmingly likely that I'm wrong. If I continue to check and recheck and take the ticket to the office and they check with a computer. Once I rule out dreaming or psychosis etc. eventually I can reasonably conclude that I did indeed win as I will have overcome that starting probability. 

But what is the starting probability for a violation of natural law, if you are unbiased? How could you ever have enough evidence to overcome an undefined likelihood? And if you are open to violations of natural law, why only accept one supernatural explanation? Why not let every undefined explanation in? The trickster god is fooling you? You're in a simulation? We all live our own separate realities? Aliens did it? etc. It seems you would need to accept all of these as possibilities if all natural explanations were ruled out and any unknown natural explanations. Of course it's a different story if you are already convinced God exists and regularly performs miracles, then there is some starting probability for you that could be overcome.

If you looked at a magician performing a really solid trick, how long would you scratch your head saying you don't know what the natural explanation is, until you shrug your shoulders and accept that he really just sawed that guy's head off, carried it around the stage and then reattached to the guy's body? I suspect you would likely just say you don't know what happened. 

That's the boat I would be in if ever a miracle had some really really solid evidence. But that being said, I have never seen anything very compelling for any miracles. So I'm curious what you have.",1

It has doubled in a year (400K+). How cool is that for a professor to know that in effect they gave their lecture to many thousands fold more than were in the lecture room.,1

"James Morgan – Are you sad because of all the so called behavioral problems humankind has?

Well, consider this: Sapolsky has the most serious behavioral tick associated with all scientists called self-righteous blind eye syndrome that causes them to arrogantly not see that all of these issues are past life experiences that have been epigenetically written to their DNA prior to reincarnation.",1
David Mollura How exactly?,1
"That final speech brought me to tears.

What marvelous, beautiful, and hopeful view of science and the human capacity. And also responsible, at the same time.",1
What a awesome lecturer ...,1
"What a beautiful way of ending the lecture. After 10 years, I have finally complete this series. I am so happy - it only took me 2 weeks, once I got down to it, and this is just wonderful <3",1
What an emotional rollercoaster this was. One of the most deeply moving experiences of my life.,1

"I didn't see it coming, how the conclusion took a serendipitous turn. But it makes sense and fills me with wonder. What a great lecture series.",1
"Thank you so much for sharing this lecture with the world. I can't express with words how much I have learnt from this lecture. I am inspired and fulfilled in so many ways.

What to do?  Love thy neighbor as thyself. Cellular automation on that rule will ensure that compassionate structure results. Thanks for the wonderful lectures.,1
What a fantastic lecture series and what an incredible teacher!!!!,1
"The greatest lecture giver of our age, i hope to be half the teacher of Prof. Sapolsky",1
What a great class thank you for sharing!,1
Why is he so amazingly inspiring? ❤️,1
"""The purpose of science is not to cure us of a sense of mystery. The purpose of science is to constantly reinvent it."" 

The last 35 hours of lectures has shown me the full gamut of human emotion: Sapolsky has moved me to tears, moved me to clap, moved me to laugh. He piqued my curiosity, my my intellect, my wonder, my disgust, my everything. Most importantly he has moved my intent to 'do something'.

""What's that about?""",1
Robert Sapolsky is boss. A severally likeable boss. Which is beyond unique. Thank you sir  :),1
Another fascinating lecture.  Has he lectured on senescence (aging)?,1
What a great person.,1
I love this series and have never gone to any university. Why do you not like it?,1
Is this course open for all backgroungs  ? And which text book should I refer ?,1
"I have heard the phrase ""the essence of who that person is"" or similar at the beginning of this lecture a few times. I haven't listened to all the lectures, only a few, but this phrase perplexes me somewhat. Has he defined this essence of who a person is? Can someone fill me in on this if I have missed it?",1
Is there a season 2? Or any recomendations about another course?,1
"I voted for ""greater free will"" after watching the whole series.  It seems like every disorder is a case where the fine balance between all our neural systems, the balance that lets us choose between different courses of action, gets unbalanced, and we lose some of our free will.  When we stop being able to make a choice, we call it a neurological disease.  It seems that our normal biology is designed to maximize our ability to make choices, compared to other animals.  What do you think?",1
What a last lecture of the course!,1
We all want the best. How can you judge others feeling.,1
"I have a question of legal matters: If a person that is diagnosed epilepsy and is being treated, has an even while driving a car and ends up killing a bunch of people because it lost control of his/her body and subsequently of the car.

"One of the possibly most important subjects that needs further research is plurality.

Any person with an open mind should be capable of seeing that the re-branding of Multiple Personality Disorder to Dissociative Identity Disorder is just constantly trying to avoid the term 'consciousness'. Even though it is understandable that within the pathological version most of these personalities or identities seem more like fragments of a consciousness, or simply 70% or just 10% of a 'full consciousness', there's a lot of moral and ethics that nobody wants to address in this issue. If a fragment has no memory of any other fragments existing, is it okay to still label it as merely a fragment and work against its existence? Does it have free will?

It gets even more complicated within the realm of positive plurality. When you identify yourself as several, at which point are there so many that each one's life quality suffers from it so much that nobody gets a good deal out of it? 10? 100? And if it's 100 different souls, is it okay to supress, merge, inactivate or kill them to increase the life quality for a smaller portion of these forms of consciousness?

In our opinion science is here still heavily under the influence of the demonic possession hypothesis, just not about demons, but about the ""one body, one soul"" rule established mostly by the big monotheistic religions. If a gene sequence exists that forms the singular consciousness within the mind, it can just as easily be duplicated or read in a way that it simply won't stop producing consciousness. And if it does, where's the boundary of morals? If one of the souls decides to go on a rampage and eradicate everyone else, is that a crime?",1

"Need a reviewer for an essay I wrote for extra credit, is this all correct?

Cells use ATP or Adenosine Triphosphate as their energy currency, but where does it come from? It is created through a process known as cellular respiration consisting of three parts, Glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and the electron transport chain. Inside the cell's cytoplasm a Glucose molecule is turned into two Pyruvates and two NADH molecules through a process called glycolysis. Each of those pyruvates are then turned into three NADH molecules and one FADH2 by the Krebs cycle. Next, The NADHs from the Krebs Cycle and Glycolysis along with the FADH2 molecules are deposited inside the Mitochondrial Matrix. There are a set of four Complexes along the inner membrane of the mitochondria that take two electrons from each NADH and each FADH2 and pump out a total of six hydrogen Ions into the Intermembrane space, the area between the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria. This creates an electrochemical gradient, meaning that those Hydrogen Ions want to get back into the Mitochondrial Matrix. A fifth Complex Lets these hydrogen ions run back through, like water through a water wheel. It uses the energy generated by the movement of the hydrogen ions to put together ADT, or Adenosine Diphosphate with An extra phosphate creating Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP. The NADHs and FADH2s from one glucose molecule create 34 ATP molecules, as well as two extras as a byproduct of the Krebs cycle and four as byproducts of glycolysis. Take away two because of the initial two ATP spent doing glycolysis and one Glucose Molecule can be turned into 38 ATPs",1

"Ana Mesia Erm, what you are saying doesn't make sense... 38ATP in glycolysis? Glycolysis is the first part of the any respiration, be it aerobic or anaerobic. The reaction itself is anaerobic, meaning it does not require oxygen. In aerobic respiration which I was talking about, I already counted glycolysis in the equation. Glycolysis gives 2 net ATP, Krebs Cycle another 2 ATP. The electron transport chain in most cells give 32 ATP, giving 36 ATP overall from 1 glucose molecule. Only specific cells like the liver, heart and kidney have aerobic respiration giving 34 ATP, for an overall of 38 ATP.﻿",1

"THIS ALL SEEMS SO COOL. there's something I don't get though. When working out, do you not feel any pain from torn muscles? Because whenever I work out I always make sure I have a lot of Oxygen for my next set. This is gained by a 45 second period of decently fast deep breathing. Then after I'm done doing 4x8 90lbs dumbell bench presses, or 200 crunches, or skull crushers, etc.(which is all intense for me),  I never feel sore even after 1hr and 30mins of just working out then breathing. The only time I ever feel any range of soreness is when I'm done doing cardio - in which I inevitably go through anerobic respiration because My lungs can't keep up. That's obviously because of Lactid Acid. So, why is it that I don't feel any soreness? Is it really because I always take the time to breathe so much?",1
"Is there a way to increase atp synthetically? The idea being, to continue to workout without becoming fatigued. If so, what would the effects be?",1

"I formerly worked assisting children with Special Needs in public classrooms.  I provided one-to-one assistance to a student who was born with Mitochondria and hydrocephalus.  Hydrocephalus does not necessarily cause any disabilities or developmental delays if caught and treated early.  My daughter's father was born with hydrocephalus and is a very healthy, athletic 6'3"" 44 year old. Mitochondria is a rare condition with little information known so much more unknown. My general understanding is the body is not able to store & metabolize protein.  The few known information I've  seen states mitochondria comes from the maternal side (I am not sure if they are referring to the condition, disease?)  How is it determined that the disabling condition mitochondria (or the lack of mitochondria passed on to the child) comes from the mother?   All healthy functional adults have mitochondria, without it we wouldn't be able to do basic daily functions like pick up our toothbrush and brush our teeth.  A child's chromosome (DNA) comes from the half paternal and half maternal.  How is it the insufficient/weak/mutated/excessive (I don't think excessive is a possible reason for mitochondria) mitochondria does not come from the paternal side and the condition is link with the maternal?  Perhaps there's new findings I don't know about but can you please explain what mitochondria condition or is it a disease is?  How mitochondria (is only) linked to be contributed from the maternal side?",1

Yes, the very term fitness is so badly understood, even amongst non-creationists. They think that the fiercest strongest most selfish animal is an idol of fitness. To them, I would say, look at the diverse ecosystems in a climax stage of succesion - who´s the fittest? Nobody. All are interdependent and individual fitness is dictated by how much an individual is getting the logic of this interdependance, and the logic of interdependance is called ethics. How come may someone think that accepting evolution will automatically prime them for becoming immoral...
As for adaptation vs evolution, and microevolution vs macroevolution, that´s also pretty messed up in the eyes of lay public. Micro and macro is just a matter of zoom, still the same process. Yes, about the insects, that´s right, and many other instances of evolution in situ were observed, even a transition from unicellular algae to a colonial type. But they will always say - it´s just adaptation. Yes, the line is curvated, and what do we get from the curvation if the line is long enough?
What is necessary is patience, everybody has to discover it for themselves, it can´t be forcefed. Have a nice day. :)",1

"Speciation is the process by which new species are formed. For a new species to form a group of the species must first be isolated from the population so that mating and reproduction cannot occur. Here are some examples.

Geographic Isolation is when a part of the species is isolated due to some physical barrier, like a mountain range.
Behavioral Isolation could be that they are active at different times of the day or they use different mating calls.

If these groups stay isolated, they will evolve independently and eventually form new species.

""A group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.""
Textbook, but can be misleading. People usually picture two different but related species meeting each other then trying to mate with each other. There are various physical, environmental, as well as behavioral reasons this does not occur, even among closely related organisms that are different species.
Sometimes the song and/or dance is just not right. This happens in allopatric speciation, when two related organisms live in overlapping areas but do not interbreed.
They need not be incapable in the sense of being unable to produce fertile offspring, or the sexual apparatus does not match, but incapable under naturally normal circumstances.
""A species is often defined as a group of individuals that actually or potentially interbreed in nature. In this sense, a species is the biggest gene pool possible under natural conditions.""
...
""That definition of a species might seem cut and dried, but it is not — in nature, there are lots of places where it is difficult to apply this definition. For example, many bacteria reproduce mainly asexually...The definition of a species as a group of interbreeding individuals cannot be easily applied to organisms that reproduce only or mainly asexually.
Also, many plants, and some animals, form hybrids in nature.""

Or is it a subtle way of hinting, ""Here's the stuff, don't strain yourself remembering the details. Do as you like.""

"Yes, thanks for saying that. One of the most common misconceptions out there is that the internet and social media is unfavorable to our acquisition knowledge because it doesn't teach us about different subjects the way that books do; but the reality of it is that if one knows how to utilize social media and what to search for on the web one can learn just as much due to its variety of information. One just has to know what to avoid",1

"Consider the following:
With so many brain cells and brain cell interconnections, how exactly does the brain even think a coherent thought?  How does the energy signal 'know' where to flow?  Obviously it does, but how exactly does it do it?  For example, spread the brain out like a map.  The towns and cities represent the brain cells and the roads and highways represent the interconnections between those brain cells.  A vehicle traveling between one or more towns and/or cities represents a coherent thought.  How exactly does the 'unconscious' vehicle 'know' what path to take to complete a specific journey?


A higher intelligence would have to tell the unconscious vehicle what path to take to complete a specific journey.  But, that is a 'specific journey' or coherent thought in and of itself.  So, how exactly does our brain think a coherent thought before it thinks that coherent thought?  How exactly do thoughts think?  What is the specific 'higher intelligence' that controls the 'unconscious vehicle' or energy signal to follow a certain path in the brain to achieve a specific journey or thought?  Consider also, that at every intersection or juncture, something would have to control the chemical flow between the neurons to have the energy signal flow a certain way.


I once heard it said that as the energy flows in the brain, it strengthens that connection, kind of like water flowing down a hill due to gravity.  But then, why isn't the brain stuck on thinking only the same thought over and over and over again as each time that thought is thought, it would ingrain that thought deeper into the brain?  But obviously, that is not how reality appears to be.  Or at least from my side of my 'consciousness' that I am supposedly experiencing.  You might be experiencing reality differently than I, assuming of course that 'you' and 'I' even actually exist.  It's possible that only 'I' exist and you all are just a figment of my imagination.  I don't perceive reality to be that way, but then again, how could I ever truly know for sure?  And for 'you', do 'I' even actually exist or am 'I' just a figment of your imagination?  Or then again, maybe there is a 'higher intelligence' imagining both of us imagining each other?


But also, 'if' there is a 'higher intelligence' behind the very thoughts I think, that thinks the very thoughts before I think them, then do I even have my own thoughts and own freewill?  How could I if I couldn't even think my own thoughts?  And if the 'higher intelligence' is a part of my own brain, (let's say my sub-conscious mind or even unconscious mind), then how exactly does it think thoughts before my conscious mind thinks those thoughts?  And if those thoughts can already be thought before I consciously think them, then why even have a consciousness that can think thoughts?  Obviously, thoughts could be thought somehow, someway, without all those pesky neurons and interconnections getting in the way cluttering up the map.


So, how exactly do thoughts think?  Do I even think my own thoughts?  What exactly is the 'higher intelligence' that thinks my thoughts before 'I' think those thoughts?  Do 'I' even actually exist to even think my own thoughts?  If so, then how does it all work.  Tell me your thoughts, if in fact you actually exist and even actually have your own thoughts to think and could convey those thoughts to my thoughts.  At least so I currently think, if I even actually exist and am thinking these thoughts that I appear to be thinking.",1

Good catch up lesson. If viewers are just here for Prof. Sapolsky and think about skipping this one: if you learned about brain function, specifically neurons and synapse function, you should be able to skip the second part (by Anthony Chung-Ming Ng) as he is mostly talking about well known chemical neurotransmitters being introduced in future lectures. 
The first part of the catch-up (by Nathan Woodling) goes into the specific names and functions of the neuron's different cell parts, which might be helpful, so I recommend at least giving it a go if you are not well versed in that (put on quicker playback speed, if you are somewhat familiar).

-Exocytosis so exciting.
ACH bonds light it up like lightning.

Questions about the story?
What?
-3, 2
Hmm.
Do the transmitters always excite?
-No.
They can be inhibitory, depending
on whether they're the ions of [INAUDIBLE] positive charge
gone.
-Only one synapse?
What if there's more?
-The hillock will sum it up, like I said before.
The synapse is the location for neuron to neuron communication.

The synapse cleft has receptors that rock to the sympathetic.

That's a small problem for medicine,

-The disease is only one part of the brain.
A pill's not a sniper.
It's a hand grenade.
It'll act wherever there reside effects plus everywhere

Don't want to sound like a cynic.
We've all got a protein they call nicotinic.
It's a receptor that can't tell the diff between ACH

-But nicotine leads to too much binding.
ACH receptors get to hiding.
Neuromuscular junction, it can't quite

"   (copy and pastes from my files):

Question:  Where do thoughts actually come from?

For example:  Modern science claims that we have billions of brain cells with trillions of brain cell connections.  How exactly does the energy signal 'know' where and when to start, what path to take, and where and when to stop to form a single coherent thought?

An analogy I utilize is to spread a brain out like a map.  Brain cells are represented by towns and cities, brain cell interconnections are represented by roads and highways, and the energy signal is represented by a vehicle traveling between one or more towns and/or cities.  A coherent thought is a coherent trip.

How exactly does the vehicle 'know' where and when to start, what path to take, and where and when to stop to form a single coherent trip?  A higher intelligence has to tell it those things.  But, that is a coherent 'trip' (thought) in and of itself.

So, how exactly does our brain think a thought before it consciously thinks that thought?  And if thoughts can be thought without consciously thinking thoughts, then what do we need to consciously think thoughts for?  Just to consciously think thoughts that are already thought?  What then of 'freewill' if we don't even consciously think our own thoughts?

And then to further that situation, modern science claims that many different energy signals are starting at various places in the brain, take various pathways, and stop at different places, just to form a single coherent thought.  (With the analogy, many vehicles are starting at various places on the map, taking various routes, and stopping at various places, all together forming a single coherent 'trip'.)  And somehow it's all coordinated and can happen very quickly and very often.

So, where do thoughts actually come from?  Who and/or what is thinking the thoughts before I consciously think those thoughts?  Do ""I"" even have freewill to even think these thoughts ""I"" am thinking about thoughts and type these thoughts to you here on this internet?

Modern science also claims we have at least 3 brains:  The early or reptilian brain, the mid brain, and the later more developed brain.  So, are early parts of the brain thinking thoughts before the later parts of the brain consciously think those thoughts?  If reptiles can think thoughts, then couldn't the early part of our brain think thoughts, and somehow pass those thoughts on to later more developed parts of later brains?  Is our 'inner self' really just our  reptilian brain thinking the thoughts that we think we are thinking?  Are we all just later more evolved reptiles?  Who don't even consciously think our own thoughts?

If not, then how exactly does the brain think thoughts?  Where exactly do thoughts originally come from so our brain can consciously think those thoughts?

So ""I"" am thinking about thoughts, if it is even ""I"" thinking the thoughts that ""I"" believe ""I"" am thinking about thoughts.  Or so ""I"" currently think, here again, if it is even ""I"" doing the thinking.  ""My"" thinking is imploding as ""I"" think about thoughts.  But then again, is it even 'me' that is imploding?  I will have to think about it some more.  Poof, I'm gone.

"This lecture is less complex and interesting compared to previous ones, pretty much because of these two lectors focusing more on reading notes than providing the general knowledge of the process. Even considering that lecture was structered just as an introduction, there were some crucial things which were not covered. E.g. a neurotransmitter was getting into a postsinaptical neuron, causing the potential to raise and fire the signal - what particularly happens to the neurotransmitter within the cell? Is it passed along with ions from dendrites to axon or does it stay and ioans are the only one moving within the cell? What about sensory system and neuron junction?

"Was ""Huxslapped"" a subtle reference to Christopher Hitchens?",1
Will we get a video about sponges?,1
But when do we get to the part that is completely dedicated to sponges?,1
"What makes sponges animals, if they're the exception to everything? Only the fact that they are multicelular and heterotrophs? Are they animals just because they couldn't be classified as fungus because they don't through digestive enzimes on the floor and then absorve the nutrients? I'm curious!",1
So the shell of a snail and a turtle will be also convergent evolution?,1
What's the name of the first organism with a digestive system and a muscular system?,1
How can you not agree with evolution? What's your better theory on how it all happened?,1
trololo what could possibly confuse you about jellyfish? one of the simplest multicellular marine invertebrates out there,1
"What about the sponges??
Thumbs up if you think Hank should do a separate video on sponge anatomy.",1
"Sponges are the only are the only animals who lack either nervous systems or a body cavity... Some multicellular plant ancestors are classified as protists because they are basically closer to algae than to the simplest of plants, yet the protozoaic flagellates have their kelp equivalent, and we consider them animals instead of protozoa?",1
So was choosing the plant the wrong answer?,1
Make a video about what makes a Sponge an animal! ,1

Are the sponges invited to the animal family reunion?,1
"am I the only who, after every Hanks sentance, said ""unless you're a sponge""?",1
"So if sponges are the exception to so many common animal traits, why are they classified under Animalia and not their own kingdom?",1
Tell us why sponges are so different...?,1
Did Hank say that common animal ancestor lived 1.6 billion years ago? I think that is roughly a time when an eukaryotic cell appeared. Animal ancestor lived about 0.6 billion years ago.,1
What about corals...?,1
Someone explain this mongol thing to me >:o Is it a reference to his brothers segments on world history?,1

Do we get a sponge t-shirt now?,1
"Aw, why don't the sponges get an awesome montage, just like the Mongols?",1
Where can I get these books!,1
"First yes theory comes after experiment, but it also comes as a result of the conclusion. The conclusion is the last part of the experiment, you look at your results and draw conclusions from them. This can lead to the formation of a theory to explain the results.

Second where did you make that point about RAVEN criteria of credibility?

Third science builds upon prior work inorder to expand knowledge. If anyone in science did as you suggest scince would grind to a halt.

how on earth is a sponge an animal?? ,1
"But sea anemones and squirts don't move either, no?",1

Do you see the sharks in the background?,1
Are sponges the Mongols of the animal kingdom?,1
"How come when we refer to other animals, we say they are mating, not that one is being raped? Also, when an animal kills another of the same species, we see it as a part of life but if it happens to us, we say its murder?

If we all come from a common ansestor, and we're all animals, then why are we not held to the same standard? 

If morals seperate us from animals, then why do other animals have some sense of morals, and if it doesn't seperate us from eachother, why is there a double standard?",1
Don't you mean the animal KINGDOM reunion?,1
Why are the sponge animals then?!,1

Unless your a sea sponge? What are you implying about the mongols?,1
"I'm not getting the ""unless you're a sponge"" jokes. Anyone care to explain?",1
"Where are all the evolutionary dead ends in animal structures, fossils or living?

If everything evolved from a single cell then it means that the genetic information of any organism is 100 percent variabled via mutation, albeit generally static after birth. Everything, from the length of your bones, their thickness, etc, all of the specifications of your body plan is contained in your DNA, correct? And mutations may act on any part of that specification ""information"", hence every trait of an organism is 100 percent variabled via mutation if a mutation happens. Okay, so what am I getting at? Essentially, why are there no failed nodes in bone structure? I say bone structure specifically, because having a bone anomaly is not necessarily a life ender, but all bone structures are basically smooth and perfect to do what they do, and are not bumpy. Life in general is very not ugly, which it seems it should be according to this line of thinking.

The only explanation for this is also problematic. That is, only traits (which are built on mutations) that cause an organism to be more fit to survive in its current environment are retained, and develop into traits. This is problematic, because then there should be a very visible, non-gapped, progression through all living things. Talk of supposed missing links is missing the real point. Where are all the missing intermediary intermediary forms? The intermediary intermediary intermediary forms, etc? It should be entirely smooth, in the fossil record and in living things, and when I say entirely I mean ""very very"". 

Also, problematic with this apparently harmonious view (which is essentially what all evolution-accepting people believe) is how can a mutation be retained if its contribution to the survivability of an organism cannot be felt, or if it is just barely apparent? For example, it is said that a wing developed from bird-like tree dwelling animals gliding to the ground via burgeoning wing appendages, but what about the form before it was even able to be used to glide? I've seen one explanation for the bat wing, saying that it could have been used to hold water, previous to being used for gliding. That's fine, but what about before that, and before that? What I mean is, we know now that our cells correct for changes in our DNA (this is not to intone that mutations cannot cause change, but that there is definite impediment to ""natural"" change), so if you were to take a form to its very origination, when it juuuust started, why would it be retained? We, also, know that changes in features are very small and compiled over time. Often, Darwin's finches are used as an example of such a change happening, and over a relatively short period, but this still misses the point. A beak has a function, (and arguably potential function), but small fluctuations leading to change on an already functioning trait do not explain how the trait originated, or how it was retained. So, what about the very beginning of the formation of the beak? Day one of the beak, if you will. There has to be an apparent advantage on Day One. To say that every burgeoning trait simply did increase fitness from day one seems implausible.

I've also heard that mutations may be stored sometimes, and appear later on, but my research here is very lacking. So, I'll leave it at that.",1

What's the name of the book again? Thank you.,1
"there's one thing she said that I am not sure about: if a non-sense mutation causes the translation to stop, you end up with a truncated protein, that most probably is not functional, so it's going to be degraded. That can be a huge problem if that's the only allele coding for such a protein, as your organism can't make any functional protein.
Am I correct?",1

lool because why would i start early?,1
"+The Chief I'm not 100% sure if you're joking or not about ""ending things"" but you said you're serious. Ending it isn't worth it man, if you failed the class you can just retake it, if you're somewhere that you have to pay for college and you don't have enough money to do so just give it a while and go back at it. A year or two of resitting something is nothing in the long run. Have you thought about maybe taking a leap year or something? I'm not sure if that'd be possible where you are but it could be beneficial to just take a year out - while you're at it, look through your old notes a couple times a week to keep it in memory. Then when you decide you wanna resit, you'll already be prepared. Failing a class isn't the end of the world dude, you have loads of options",1

"I was put on ketamine after a had several surgeries within a month (they were worried about the amount of opioids I had been on, and the amount needed to control pain straight after surgery having a shoulder replacement  might kill me post-op). I beseech the medico's out there, be it G.Ps, surgeon, nurses etc, to give patients the heads up about ketamine BEFORE the surgery - I came out of surgery, woke in the recovery room, and thought I was in a cartoon - everyone looked like something between a Disney character and Avataar (did I spell that right?). I would have panicked, except I was too smashed. I asked if I was hallucinating, and some guy I assume to be the anaesthetist said ""no,"" that's the ketamine,"" - if this wasn't hallucinating, I need a new definition. I was in a lot of pain, but it was someone else's pain, if that makes sense (if you were on ketamine it might - it's called a ""dissociative state"", IMT). Very trippy.

"I'm not knowledgeable on this subject and will probably screw up this question but for what it's worth, here goes . . .

In any male dominate species, I'll use lions for example, where they are known to kill the offspring of other males. The dominate male mates with the female of his choice and therefore his genes are propagated accordingly.  If only one male has the opportunity to breed and all the other males do not, how would that affect the future of the species if there is not sufficient genetic variances to offset the problems associated with inbreeding. Evolutionarily speaking, with any species having similar mating behavior, how did that behavior come to be if the behavior leads to the detriment of the species?",1

In particular in relation to - how does early childhood trauma especially sexual abuse impact on shaping the physiology, FAP and sexual behaviour? Especially where the peadophile parent groomed their child to accept that ""intimacy"" included having sex with them.... let alone an organisational structural environment (aka cult) to further enhance that behaviour ... what happens to the testosterone modulating system, as a child and into adulthood??

"Hi, I also have a few questions,...
first Mitochondria (or rather their DNA) in human cells can be used to find this one Eve, but I wonder how much does the Mitochondrial DNA in animals differ from ours? And why does the mitochandrial DNA not change with time? We observe mutations in the DNA of rhe nucelous all the time - this is what makes us different - so why doesn't the mitochondrial DNA change? Also I wonder if there is something like Mitochondrial-cancer, you know cancer cells divide and divide and grow. Couldn't a mitochondria do the same? So back to the plants, what brought me to that questions the first time. If chloroplasts are like mitochondria, swallowed up bacteria, and if we can use the mitochondrial DNA in Mitochondria to find Eve for humans, can't we than use the DNA in chloroplast to find plant-Eve. And also if plants also have Mitochondria and and also their cells are eucaryotic couldn't it be that there was one cell in the beginning that did catch a mitochondria and kept it and then divided, and one of those then did catch the cytoplast? What I'm getting to is couldn't we use the DNA in those litte organells to find the common ancestor (cell) of plants and animals?

Also - is there a point of no return in the developmental phase of an animal for genes to activate for example could that eye be grown from scratch on a fully formed adult fly or does it have to be directed from the beginning whilst its still just an embryo?",1

"correct me if I'm wrong, but in the evolution of the tooth to beak, would the beak gene not need to be developed anyway, regardless of whether it was activated or not?

Any ideas anybody???

"ArcanE LogoS (theGhost) "" ... A-biogensis ... and it's physically impossible. ""

Really?  Then why are there scientists still working on it?  You know more than they do?  Why not write a paper and submit to a scientific journal like Nature or Science?",1
ArcanE LogoS (theGhost) You still have not shown that abiogenesis is impossible.   Care to take another stab at it?,1
DNAunion (ehem) LAW of biogenesis. There's people who get funding to try to communicate with ET's too! Does that mean we should take them seriously? No. ,1
You realise biogenesis doesn't biochemistry right? Because it doesn't deal with biochemistry. Yes life does not  just pop out of dead bodies or rotten food but life can arise from chemical processes. Also lying for athiesm? Abiogenesis has nothing to do with athiesm. ,1
ArcanE LogoS (theGhost) Can you show it's use in a peer-reviewed scientific journal?,1

why are these videos always about evolution now?,1
"Crazy idea?  Of course it is false!?  How the heck can a explosion create life, and don't say the evolution scientists don't know yet.  Plus what caused all the animals to evolve anyway?

If you are a Christian, then our way on how the universe was created makes more sense.  Scintists say that there was a catastrophic flood a million or something years ago, but they don't know what caused it?  That flood was Noah's flood and it didn't happen a million years ago, ha!  That's not even close.

And we (the Christians) know what creates life, God does, you know, since he can do anything.

There is a TON more true evidence that evolution is entirely false, but that would take up a dozen pages, and you probably still won't believe me, because you have to understand the Christianity.   For example, if I said ""God created the universe, not The Big Bang"", you would just say ""there is no God"", so you wouldn't believe me anyway sadly.






And if the reason why you don't believe in God is because you think ""if there was a God, then why would he let evil in the world?"".  Its because a loving God would let his creation have ""free will"", and if the only thing you could choose was God and nothing else, then thats not free will at all.  You would choose God because you don't have a choice, even if you didn't want to.",1
"Dangarous016 Just step outside. Hear the birds singing, the crickets chirping, and see the beautiful lumbering trees. Now how did this diversity come to be? Evolution of course. Evolution caused everything to be different and equally similar. But what started evolution? What gave the universe this magnificent system in which atoms create molecules, molecules create amino acids, and amino acids eventually create me and you? Most people will say life exists because there was a need for life to exist. There are many things that are wrong with this. First off, why would life need to exist if doesn't exist already. Now yes, of course a bolt of lightning could have struck a pool of liquid that contained all of the necessary elements for life to arise, and create a cell. Now this is all is fine and dandy for this little cell, but the cell can't do anything. The information for it to reproduce, metabolize, and even simply function as a unit is stored in DNA. If you break it down even further, the formation of a simple protein, which basically regulates most of the body's processes, is incredibly complex, and is created by proteins. Basically all the information of proteins was created by a protein. This leads me to my final conclusion. There had to be some driving force, some kick in the but that started this whole machine of life. What was this driving force? What kicked life in the but? Now, of course it couldn't have been a lightning bolt, as lightning bolts can not tell the cell how to make proteins, or how to code DNA, or how to regulate your body temperature to the degree. Something or SOMEONE, had to give this original set of information that told the cell how to form proteins, and later an entire organism. This is where God comes in. He set in motion the machine that has ran since the beginning of time. God is not the 'biggest bullshit in the world', he is the very reason life exists. Just look at the facts.",1
"***** Oh my goodness!  What are you saying?  (I know what you are saying, I'm just surprised you are saying it).  Do you really think that random people wrote the Bible on, what, theories?  Heck no!  And if what your saying is true, that Jesus was just an ordinary man, then how could he do all of those medicals?  Like walk on water, turn water into wine, or make tons of fish and bread appear from nothing?  And if you think it is because people mad him up, you can't, because the way you talked about him meant that he was real.  And if the people in the Bible believed in a God that was not real, then how could they talk to him?  There are many parts in the Bible where people talk to God, and he still talks to us sometimes.

I know a few people who heard God talk to them.  My Mom even said that when she was young, she was hanging with the wrong crowd, and when she walked home one night, she heard God say, ""why do you disobey me?  Did I not die for you?"".

There was another experience one of my relatives had one time.  When he was young, he didn't want anything to do with God.  He was married to a Christian wife, and she loved listening to hymns on the radio.  One time, when he was alone next to the radio, it turned on by itself and immediately went to the Christian hymn station.  He tried turning it off, (since he hated God) but the power button wouldn't work. The music was still on.  He unplugged it, it had no electricity, but the music was still playing.  And then he heard God speak to him.  He's been a Christian ever since.

And when people die in a hospital, and then the doctors bring them back to life (on rare accessions) they said that they saw heaven when they died, because they believed in God.  But when it happens to people who don't believe (like you BiscutCat), they said that they saw hell, and how horrid, terrifying and frightening it is.  Do you think I made this part up?  Think again, because there are a few documentaries on rare accessions like this.

And did you know that Noah's Ark was found?  That's right!  Real proof!  The reason why you might of never heard of it or seen picture of it is because the country it is in, Turkey, has a government that keeps it hidden.  Like Area 51.",1
"UltraSonic ok, then why don't you believe in Islam, or Hinduism, or the Nordic gods, or the legend of Hercules etc...They were all written by ancient people that you say ""weren't random and crazy"" They all claimed miracles that people saw and they all have people today claiming to have supernatural experiences. Why the fuck then do you chose Christianity. Using your logic, apparently all myths and extraordinary claims are true. What about the muslims that claim to be visited by jinns? Or the hindus and their myths and so on. If those are true then those religions are also true and if they arent then why is yours specifically true? ",1

"Well, this ""scientist"" just gave us some pretty interesting name drops: ""control"", ""architects,"" ""construction,"" ""building,"" ""subcontractors,"" ""send instructions,"" ""basic blueprint."" etc., etc., Evolution is based upon RANDOM MUTATIONS, nothing being directed for the origin of the new information. Does anyone believe that ""architects"" build with randomness? Does anyone believe that ""buildings"" are the products of random failures with paint, steel, and glass? Does anyone believe that ""blueprints"" in construction are just random lines? BS!!!! All of it is the product of intelligence, a mind putting into action. None of these terms he used are random :)",1

If evolution is quack then why are there different races of people that are better suited to places where their ancestors grew up? Why do some animals become unable to mate with others and speciate? Do different species of things not exist now?,1
"Um, all discoveries were initially random. No we don't build buildings through random failures with paint/steel/glass, but before we knew how to do that, there were a lot of random failures while people figured it out! Billions of years before we had today's species and the insanely complicated DNA structure that now exists, there were lots of random mutations which failed to survive - the whole point of natural selection???",1

"The automatic breathing. Very interesting I would love to talk to Dr. Sapolsky about this. Did you guys hear about Shoujo the albino baby dolphin in Japan? What happened is in 2013 the Japanese dolphin hunters brutally slaughtered dolphins in Taiji. They separated Shoujo from her mother with force cutting into her muzzle. After Shoujo was brought to a pool in the Taiji dolphin museum the mother of Shoujo stopped breathing and died. People speculated on whether she committed suicide or whether she was so stressed and in so much grief over her daughter that she did not have the energy to breathe anymore. Note that dolphins have to come to the surface to breathe because they are mammals, but this surfacing mechanism is fairly automated just like our breathing and they do that also when they sleep. So when the mother lost her energy to breathe it is very similar to depressed humans often having to force themselves to breathe deeper or breathe at all. I had that happen to me many times out of grief as well. (Grief over the animals suffering.)",1

That 20 minutes - for a woman less for a man - allows their physiological status to return to normal/baseline, so they can interact with you normally and not in a heightened state.

"   Analysis is still needed for some who still believe God actually exists besides just as a concept and for people who still believe humans have a 'soul', and an immortal conscious soul at that, and for people who still believe humans have a conscious afterlife, and an actual eternal conscious afterlife at that.

How else can one educate delusional individuals unless one can have valid arguments to do so?  Do you just accept everything you are told as being really true?",1
"   I ask for actual factual evidence of their apparent supernatural beliefs.  Do you just believe supernatural items without any actual factual evidence to support those beliefs?

And yes, they can believe whatever they want to believe, as can I and others believe whatever we want to believe.  But truth is still truth and reality is still reality.

Many people claim that God is a 'male' and yet cannot even prove God actually factually exists much less being able to prove God is a 'male'.  And some claim other human characteristics of God, and cannot prove those claims either.

Reality appears to indicate that these individuals are delusional and are believing in fairy tales as if those fairy tales were really true.

Santa Clause is just a concept, and so is God.  Nothing more.
(Or so the evidence and analysis supports).  Now if you have any actual factual evidence that Santa Clause or God actually factually exists, please feel free to present that evidence here.

And this is my thread for this video.  Why do you and others attack me for my beliefs?",1
"   Hopefully these items will help humans and other species to survive beyond this Earth and solar system.  (To help prolong human's life).  But does it ultimately matter?  If so, to whom eternally to?  Currently, the analysis indicates that we are it.  We either figure out how to actually exist throughout all of future eternity somehow, someway, somewhere, in some state of existence, even if only by a continuous stream of ever evolving species, for life itself to have continued meaning and purpose to, OR none do and we all die one day from something, will forget everything we ever knew and experienced, and would all be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.  It wouldn't even matter that any of us existed much less how we existed while we existed.  Life itself would all be ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things.  Life itself would only matter to life itself only as long as life itself still existed.  It's just that life itself will not always exist.  Or so the current analysis would indicate.

I currently consider my self to be an 'existentialist', defined as one who studies topics related to existence itself, including ceasing to exist and non-existence.  I can even show how it's possible that existence and non-existence can exist side by side for all of eternity.  (Dependent on the gravity test results, which will speak for itself).  But does it ultimately matter?  If so, to whom does it eternally matter to throughout all of future eternity?  Here again, the current analysis would indicate that we are it.  And when we die, we are dead for all of future eternity.  Game over.  Thanks for playing the game of life, but no conscious entity is left to care.

Well, what if the gene simply functions differently? It is suupposed to produce this much protien, but it produces a little more, resulting in a stronger body part or something. Or maybe the opposite, it is supposed to supply this ammount of protien, but it supplies a little less, thus something being weaker. Would you call that a mutation, or simply just a difference between person to person?

"A little before 7:30, Mr. Lander says that in this flipped version you would be adding on the the 3 prime end. It was my understanding that that is how it usually is? Also, if his primer contains Ribose than means it is RNA. I was also lead to believe that RNA doesn't contain Thymine so how could his RNA primer have that sequence?",1
"I cannot understand why DNA Ploymerase 1.)  Needs an RNA Primer  2.)  can only add nucleotides to the 3' end.

The professor addresses my second question around 7:50, but I couldn't conceptualize what he is saying ""It is bad to invest your tri-phospates into the growing strand because if they hydrolyze you loose your growing strand?""  By what mechanism?  Are the tri-phosphate nucleotides hydrolyzing randomly in the nucleus?  If they are, how is the energy harvested?  Why is that optimal?",1
What is the directionality of helicase.. Does it differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes..!? Do all types of helicase stick only to one strand during replication..!?,1

If you had pppApppTpppCpppCpppC, and those phosphates hydrolyzed, the rest of the growing DNA chain would be destroyed.  That makes sense.  However, why not allow the phosphates to be hydrolyzed prior being attached at the 3' end?

I thought 'Primers' are short strands of RNA.. how can they have Thymine in it to complement the Adenine of DNA template? Shouldn't that be Uracil instead?,1
Do you really think this is simply about chemicals and random chance? Have you considered that if it takes geniuses to unravel some thing that possibly a genius designed it in the beginning?,1

No, this is not consistently the case. Can't believe this old myth is repeated here.
What recent, high quality studies have shown again and again is that poverty does not cause violence, but it are big differences in socio-economic status along with low cognitive ability.

In other words: If you are at the end of the social ladder, there is lots of room to climb but you do not have the cognitive ability to climb by fair means then you turn to criminal behavior and violence.
From an evolutionary POV this also makes tons more sense than the notion that you could gain much by violence in a very poor society.

Some individuals are explicitly trained to problem solve using the scientific method, controlling variables very precisely; others go about problem solving very well without explicit instruction about the scientific method-implicit— in both cases the frontal cortex functioning very well consciously and unconsciously respectively, with very little involvement of the amygdala until one makes a preventable mistake... all of this happening outside a functional MRI!
Some individuals take substantial risks, with or without risk-benefit and cost analysis.

Enjoyed the video.   Just one question: what happened to the ovaries of the strawberry seeds if they are not a fruit and their seeds are suspended on a stalk?,1
Where have you been all my life? I've never understood Biology until you appeared on my youtube page! Same goes for your brother in the history department :P:P,1
What came first... the gametophyte or the sporophyte?,1
"how do needle trees differ from broad-leaf trees? which came first, I suppose my real question is. It seems to me like needle trees are more advanced since they stick around during the winter and can get a head start on expanding in the spring, but they seem sparse when not had local maximum elevation (I've noticed they seem to fair best on mountains during my New England hikes). 
Any help please?
",1
"Is this alternation of generations something that has been used to describe plant reproduction for a long time?  I took a college biology course in 1997 and we went into a lot of detail but it was never described this way explicitly.  If it has been a thing for a long time, then has it been mainstream in teaching it?

they they clone themselves?",1
"what do you mean ""taste like they do"".  In what way does their taste relate to their category?",1

Where is he?,1
How was that nectarine?,1
"hold up so do bees know what theyre doing when they pollinate a plant, or are the plants just hoping the bee somehow touches the anthers and magically brush up against the stigma?",1
Hey hank can you do a video on animal classification? It would really help,1
"lol; will you eat strawberry in replacement for carrots? 
Fruits, in the diet sense, are more sweet and you will eat them more as a desert type of food. You don't usually present carrots and salad as a desert. Tomato is a fruit, strictly speaking, but you will eat it as a vegetable.",1
"I've a question:
If there are in some cases male and female plants, do they, like animals have a different set of chromosomes?

"My strawberry plant reproduces asexually by cloning itself and planting them in nearby soil. So, what is the purpose of the seeds on the outside of the strawberry if it reproduces a different way?",1
why do u care,1
you eat fruits and vegetables differently?,1
What symbiotic relationships are not mutualistic?,1
What does that say about honey?,1
"Nothing in evolution *knows* everything. But plants that were tasty to insects gained an advantage over other plants because the insects would move their pollen around. And plants that started secreting nectar gained an even greater advantage, because no important parts would be eaten by the insects.

Meanwhile, insects that sought out plants gained an advantage because they could exploit a great food source, so plants and pollinators evolved in response to one another. Y'see?",1

so a tomato is a fruit right? ,1
"So, is Hank in the doghouse for something?",1
Isn't it technically a double entendre?,1
"another important point, species that reproduce sexualy are more diverse genomes, and thus much more resilient to microbes and viruses because some of them will have genetic combinations that will render them imune, where asexual organism are ""genetic bankrupt"" and thus tend to die in larger numbers.
If a specie can double in 20 minuts as E. coli that tends not to be a huge problem, but for animals who take many years to reach maturity like us and elefants it would be a disaster",1

The reddish-white part inside, which you referred to as the ""carple"", does not contain seeds at all- it is the receptacle of the flower turned into the fleshy bittersweetness we all love. The ""hard things"" on the outside are called ""achenes"" which is a miniature hard fruit that contains the actual seed inside. And in case THAT was was you were referring to as ""carples,"" no, they do not have Carpels inside them either.

Young earth creation? You'd have a great deal of beautiful science to reject..

YECs would obviously disagree.

So you would say that modern humans are the same kind as homo habilis?

Or that domestic cats are of a different kind than the Asian golden cat, Lynx, panther, cheetah, Leopard cat, Pallas's cat ..?

Well, I'd agree but I wouldn't use ""kind"".

The ancient greek word genos actually means ""race, stock, kin"".",1
"John Doe Yes, YECs would disagree with me. So don't talk about all ID proponents as if we agree with YECs about the Bible.

I don't know what homo habilis was, and neither do you.

About the cats, are they all in the same genus?

And, finally, where did YOU get your definition of GENUS? (not genos)",1
"Ed Reynolds
ID, creationism ... same nonsense (as shown in court and even by Templeton Foundation documents).

We do know what homo habilis was. Same genus as modern humans. By your definition they belong to human-""kind"".

All these cats are not in the same genus. They are in fact all different. By your definition these are all different ""kinds"" of cats.

There are several places where you can find the definition of ""genus"". Try Encyclopaedia Brittanica, biology books ..

What ID/creationist source defines ""kind"" as genus?",1
"John Doe ID is science; young earth creationism is religion. We don't let courts decide for us what we believe.

IF homo habilis was human, then it was of human kind. Do you have a problem with that? I don't.

About the cats, yes, they ARE different kinds of cats, but are they different created 'kinds'? We don't know. And neither do evolutionists know whether they are PROPERLY considered different Genii. Recall what this video says at 2:00:

ACCORDING TO EVOLUTIONISTS, ""THE LIVING WORLD IS ALL ONE GREY AREA"".

Isn't it a little hypocritical to demand sharp delineations from creationists when evolutionists excuse themselves from the same requirement?

You still haven't cited your source for your definition of genus. Please supply it.",1
"John Doe So you DON'T have a source for your definition of genus. Then you don't have a definition of genus.

"Ed Reynolds
""So you DON'T have a source for your definition of genus.""
WTF? I just spoon-fed you two different sources.
Can you not read?

Encyclopaedia Britannica and a publication in the Journal of ""Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research"" is not reliable?",1

Unfortunately, I have to correct you there. Humans are in there OWN GENUS - Sapiens. Figure it out; the first word is the species, HOMO, the second word is the genus, SAPIEN. 

To call humans a ""SUB-SPECIES"" seems way off the mark. Do you care to explain that?",1
"Ed Reynolds With pleasure. 

Modern humans are actually Homo Sapien-Sapiens. Sapien-Sapiens are a sub-species of Homo Sapiens, which is of the genus Homo such as Homo Erectus. 

And the genus Homo is part of Hominidae, which is either family or class. 

You got it backwards. Organisms are named in science by their Genus-Species (Homo Sapien), not as you suggested by their Species-Genus (Which would make us Sapien Homo). 

Is this a sufficient explanation?",1
"Vir Animus yes, thank you Vir for that correction. So that still means that humans are in their own genus, correct?",1
"Vir Animus ""A hypothesis would be ""Life is Intelligently Designed""""
Yes, that's what I said.

""Then there MUST be a way to test it to prove that it can be wrong""
Yes, that's what I gave you.
As soon as scientists find a detailed evolutionary pathway (via random genetic mutation) to explain the appearance of life or any of its major structures/systems, Intelligent Design will be falsified.

What part of that did you not understand/agree with?",1
"+Ed Reynolds Currently, the only surviving member of the genus homo is homo sapiens. Extinct members of the genus are Erectus, Habilis, and Neanderthalensis. What does that have to do with anything? 

I said modern humans are a sub species, you said no. I showed you that you were wrong. You said it was species-genus, I showed you that you got it backwards. Now you ask if homo is its own genus. Of course it is. Homo is the genus. What are you trying to get at? 

And that is not what you said. You said intelligent design is the best way to explain life on earth. That is not a hypothesis. Period. If that isn't what you meant to say, don't say it. Also period. 

You can't say your theory is falsifiable if and only if another theory proves itself in a particular way to your liking. That isn't how the scientific method. It has to be able to stand alone. 

Intelligent Design is not falsifiable, there is no testable hypothesis to prove or disprove it, so it isn't compatible with the scientific method, so it isn't science. That's the end of that, Ed. I would have been happy to talk to you, or anyone for that matter, about all of this stuff because it's interesting to me, but you're such a pompous, pretentious blowhard.

"If you look at it carefully, evolution has no element of faith in it.

It is tautological.

Evolution is selection on mutations.

Premise 1: selection occurs. Selection alters genotype frequencies. (no one denies this, by the way) A very simple example of selection: suppose you have many sheep, some black and some white. You kill off all of the black sheep every generation. Over time the gene for black wool become rare and the gene for white become more prevalent. No problems so far? Okay. 

Premise 2: Mutations occur.
The DNA sequence can change (mutate) by many means: replication error, random mutation, resulting from environmental factors (mutagens), UV damage, etc. A change in the DNA sequence of a gene can change the way it works. If a mutation occurs in a sperm or egg, the baby can be born with a new version of a gene that didn't come from its mother or father.
Continuing the sheep analogy; in a very, very rare event, a mutation occurs that results in a sheep being born with a gene for brown wool. This is a new gene that wasnt present in the mother or father.

Conclusion: If you accept that selection changes the gene ratios, and if you accept that mutation can result in new versions of a gene, then it follows that selection can act on  the new genes.
That is, it  is possible that over many generations the gene for brown wool - the mutant gene - could spread through a population. Eventually, you could change from a white and black flock to a population of all-brown sheep. via the process of evolution.

Excuse my typos- using phone again- 

sadly even so, the fact is eminent- Those who do not believe shall die eternally.
Starting with the first thing, is if your single, obveously thats different, Naturally that's not adultery saying she's good looking. Duh-
Read the definition of adultery, you have to married in the first place. In the case of rape before marriage, God says they are forced to be married. He goes on saying, if that is not followed, You have committed a sin. By Human laws, if your American, we still call it rape, by court of all wther it's valunteered or not. We naturally by court of all follow what God says there. Actually did you know most human laws are based on the 10 commandments?


Second, Father or Mother, why curse the thing that gives you life? Doing so you say your life is meaningless. That you parents should have never had you. Meaning you're calling it a mistake? Wouldn't you in your mind punish a kid who does such a thing?
That;s saying your mother of father hates you, and you should go die. That would be wrong in your mind correct?


------ Why is it that people fight eachother these days? It's becuase everything is so mixed up. It starts when one defies a truth. I'm not completely agains Same sex marriage and stuff,  but in Gods eye's it's wrong. For one we see it happen Naturally. It just doesn't work. THat destroys the value of life, causes decay and death. From Birth we have that decay. I've noticed people who live longer always been true believers. Not somebody who does it to gain stuff. Just like the first sin committed. It started with Greed.
Greed is the source of Corruption",1

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour- correct you are, and look its a law based on the commandment

"Max Spiegel for a start, you seem to think the 10 commandemtn are narrow minded, when they're more open than you think. Why do you think there's a new testiment explaining the 10?",1

a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.
a set of principles on which the practice of an activity is based.
an idea used to account for a situation or justify a course of action.

Science most commonly uses the first definition by the book, but in things that cannot be physically proven by science is taken by the 3rd definition.
A theory is also known as a belief. Thats why we fight Evolution- it's more Belief orenated then factualized. Just like our selfs theres no physical proof except our books which in your eyes is just a book. Which in a case it is by definition. :P

Is creationism compatible with the reality we see in the present? Nope. If creationism were true we would expect to see humans and dinosaurs and trilobites in all rock layers equally. We would not expect to see ~2 billion years of single-celled life before the first signs of multicellular life. How would something like the Green River in Colorado form if creationism were true?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_Formation

Creationism can be flatly and completely disproved through a single observation like the Green River. It has no science supporting it at all. Evolution could be disproved easily by finding a rabbit in a pre-Cambrian rock layer, yet nobody ever has. Instead every piece of evidence we find corroborates evolution further, and makes it more clear that creationism is absurd.",1

"***** The fossils are separated by the geologic layers. If you understand the ages of the layers, how can you explain the fact that we don't have humans in the layers with dinosaurs, or dinosaurs with trilobites, or trilobites before the cambrian?",1
"Max Spiegel Though what I've been told is a Theory and is unproven, they say there used to be a layer of water that surounded the Earth. Those old fossles show less signs of radiation then we get today. That means two things, either our atmosphere once had a protective layer which today they say was the layer of water, or the sun had to be less explosive (Just using as a sub) then it is now. If the Layer of Water existed, that water would serve as a barrier. The Water would become a reflector. But also the greenhouse effect would be more imminent. That would prove Pangea that existed. Which in Biblicals temrs would before the Babylonian tower. Which this happen later on

The account in Genesis makes no mention of any destruction of the tower. The people whose languages are confounded simply stop building their city, and are scattered from there over the face of the Earth. However, in other sources, such as the Book of Jubilees (chapter 10 v.18-27), Cornelius Alexander (frag. 10), Abydenus (frags. 5 and 6), Josephus (Antiquities 1.4.3), and the Sibylline Oracles (iii. 117-129), God overturns the tower with a great wind. In the Midrash, it said that the top of the tower was burnt, the bottom was swallowed, and the middle was left standing to erode over time.

which would been consider the seperation point of Pangea. The Destruction of this would in a since if were proven true would explain not only the collapse of the tower, but Pangea. The Massive force which is desribe in the Bible is known to be strong enough to acomplish this, which in the Bible states the Seperation of Tongue- Race etc.

Later on, this would cuase the failure of the outter layer, cuasing rain. For greenhouse could no longer work. The Layer of Water was then lost, and cuase what we call THE GREAT FLOOD. 

There's more, but I'd rather not hit you with all the details, I'd rather you research it.",1
"***** You have been lied to. I don't know who told you this stuff, but older fossils don't have surprisingly low levels of radiation, and a layer of water wouldn't have changed anything even if it did. It is hydrogen and nitrogen which stop radiation in the upper atmosphere, not water. This is all wrong on both in terms of scientific principles and evidence. Pangea existed over 300 million years ago - before humans even existed - so you can't believe in it and be a YE creationist at the same time. Next time, ask a biologist to explain whether or not evolution is unproven, or what even constitutes ""proof"" to a scientist.

I don't need to research anything, because you have given no viable explanation of the raw physical data. All you did was say ""meh, it sounds like the Tower of Babel,"" which it does not. Explain how the Green river formed. Explain why we don't see trilobites in the dino layers, dinos in the human layers, and so on.

So why exactly are organisms hierarchically classified,1
"Cladistics is a system of classification. Cladistics classifies all things by their evolutionary history, into clades. Evolutionary history is inferred through phylogenetics. So phylogenetic studies are what inform cladistic classification.

There's not much of a difference between a cladogram and a phylogenetic tree. The differences between them are not super well defined like their parent ideas. One way to explore the differences would be to considered almost characterized ideals of two extremes, however real diagrams in real academic journals are in the grey between these two. A cladogram is usually more concerned with relationships than anything else, and usually has little supplemental data. A cladogram will be made to look pretty and/or exemplify relationships at the expense of distorting or ommitting other information. A phylogenetic tree is more concerned with the information that was used to infer relationships. Branch lengths are usually proportional to some trait of interest, and other information such as confidence in support of nodes may be present as well. As a general statement though, a phylogenetic tree is a kind of cladogram, which is why trying to differentiate them seems so tricky.

Speciation is a process in evolution. Evolution is defined as just, ""change over time."" Biological evolution specifically how life forms, species, change over time, and how new species come into existence. In life it can most simply be said that there is diversity, and complexity. Genetic/genomic are responsible for how a species descendants can be vastly different from ancestors. Geneaological processes (which define speciation), combined with genetic/genomic processes are responsible for why there are separate and distinct populations, different species!

"Ethology is about interviewing an animal in it's own language. 
Nicolaas Tinbergen, Conrad Lorenz, Karl von Frisch (1973 Nobel laurets in Physiology/Medicine)

Contrasts with behaviorism - which is about extreme environmentalism - you can control everything about an animal's behaviour through positive and negative reinforcements.

The questions that ethology asks -
1. What is the fixed action pattern? 
2. How can it be improve upon? (ie what are the contexts in which the animal learns to do it better?)
3. What are the evolutionary advantages of having that fixed action pattern?
4. What stimuli from the outside environment triggers the pattern?
5. What happens inside the animal's nervous system between a stimulus triggering a behaviour and that behaviour actually occurring?
6. What does learning have to do with all this?",1

"The more different environments you study something in the lower your heritability will be. So you need to study in maximally natural and different environments.
BF Skinner and Behaviorism. All tabulsa rasa and are environmentally and can be purely reinforcively conditioned.

Ethology. The variation of behavior. Contradiction with behaviorists.
Tinbergen, Lorenz, Frisch.

Species have fixed action patterns which are normalized but can be improved upon. And they have adaptive value. Bees moving in an 8 figure. The fixed action patterns are the own language of the animal. Experiments are strictly natural. Modifying some stimuli what modifies the trajectory or some measured gradation of a property of a fixed action pattern.
When females are ovulating their voices go higher, and males can detect this.
Visual, and olfactory stimuli.

Olfactory. Sweat difference depending on stress quantity. Their amygdala activates if their smelling it from the terrified individuals.

Electricity.
Vibration. Elephants.
Tactile Stimulation. The child goes not the wire with milk, it goes to the cloth for warmth and bonds, Harry Harlow. More incubators the lower the life expectancy.

Congruences in babies cross species. People react similarly to baby faces.

How does a bird learn its specie (rough) song
Lordosis reflex in hamsters.

What does learning have to do with fixed action patterns.

Animals teach behavior (eg. to progeny.)
Animals make tools. Use wood as weapons. 

Learning that violates reinforcement theory. Animals will imprint on something over a short period, (recognizing mom, there is a short period). No trial and error!
Critical period is a relative term.*

Prepared learning. Certain associations with something are more likely than others. He had prepared learning with food much more than external stimuli.

Humans show prepared learning for being afraid of spiders and snakes. Change in a flash and we can pick up a snake or a spider.

( ) discovered echolocation. Published on the book animal awareness. Do animals have self awareness?
Marmasets never look at themselves in the eye.

Theory of Mind. When do you realize there are other individuals who are different?
Chimps can only do theory of mind in highly competitive dynamical states.

Are these examples of learning all examples a situation where if you could run back the tape some novel behavior was transmitted culturally to other members of the group?
2) Theory of mind: does the bee dance ( these other bees don't have have the same information as me therefore I will communicate it with them ) count as theory of mind?

"Symmetry of face?

 I've spent years, daily checking my face. 

My right side is usually the problem as it can look up to ten years older than my left. As I check my eyes I notice whether there are bee-sting eye lids, bags below, or even V-shaped eye overhangs. 

This check gives me feedback about food allergies and general health. If my eyes are symmetrical -- no overhang or bags under either eye and both eyes look the same age, then my health is superior and my diet free from gluten, meat/fish/dairy, preservatives, rancid oils, and especially MSG. 

I'm 74 years, if I change my diet away from fresh home-prepared foods my health suffers, my face loses symmetry, and I age 5-10-years.

Is there some benefit to this daily bother? 

Well I could walk 20-30 kilometers tomorrow without a problem. 
So I believe the bother of CHECKING THE MIRROR DAILY FOR SYMMETRY is well worth it.

Summary Points: 

1. Origin of life millions/billions of years ago
-Introduction of Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes. 

2. Multicellular organisms and their genetic material. 
- Length of their genome 
- Evolutionary study of their genome

3. How we understood the basis of genetics. 
- Structure of DNA 
- How we all have 99.9% same genome 

4. Use of Fluorescence to sequence genome (Visualisation)
- Comparison of genome of trillions of our own cells
- treatment of diseases (genetically)

5. Ethics in Biology 

6. Inheritance

7. Application of everything we are going to learn (in real world: Crimes and medicine)

8. Know about your ancestry/Lineage
- for catching criminals

9. Cell signalling and how molecules/cells interact within our body 

10. How our body takes it's shape? 
- Learn about our body with the help of some models of Fly's embryo (I guess can't study with human embryo because of those ethical stuff explained before👀)

Thank you!

We get 23 single pairs of chromosomes from each of our parents and when the sperm and egg fuse they fuse each of their chromosomes. So now instead of being single chromosomes they are pairs and it would be 23 pairs. Why do people say we have 46 chromosomes when it’s just 23 pairs and I was taught that the single chromosomes in the pair are chromotids so that would be we have 23 chromosomes and 46 chromotids?,1

The one who owns the highest of description, and placed us in a firm lodging and extracted us from the womb of our mother so that we may dwell in this land. In this land we live and to the womb of the land we will be buried and to him we will return. It is he, the true king of all dominions, who created everything in pair, the heaven and the earth, man and wife, night and day , truth and falsehood and it is he who separates the two seas with his light. It is he who BEGINS creation and REPEATS. None begins and repeats except him, the Almighty. How are we then deluded by the truth? ""While He has created you in stages?"" (71:13)

""Allah originates the creation, then He repeats it, then to him you will returned"" (30:11)

"​   Education is incredibly beneficial. Yes, a lot of educators do a terrible job and do more harm than good, but if you are comparing some of the atrocious systems we have set up in our K-12 public school system with a lecture from Stanford then that is a pretty stupid comparison to make and depending on your teachers there was plenty of value to be had in K-12 education as well. I can't imagine going back to school at 35 to take advanced mathematics courses in my CS degree if I never was forced to go to school. They have to force you to.

I've never been big on typical romantic gestures like getting flowers,jewelry, what turns me on is excitement, drama(though I've mellowed in my old age, cuddling and companionship is far more important to me than sex.

"   Don't apologize, you did nothing wrong.  Just because YOU say I'm wrong, doesn't mean I AM wrong.
Here's a scenario where the person pays no attention to boundaries.
Shipwrecked in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Life raft has no devices to tell global positioning, and has no raw materials to craft a makeshift compass.  No food, no water, only the raft, a paddle and a small sail.  The sky is completely overcast, so he doesn't have a means to tell east from west.  The oceanic current is around 3mph so that's negligible.  No radios, no phones, no walkie talkies, no ability to tele-communicate with another human being.
Isolated and alone.


Objective: get to land and sanctuary before you die of thirst or hunger.  What do you do?  


The above scenario I know for a fact, according to the US Coast Guard, has happened numerous times.  Container freighters have found people that died of thirst (or even worse, salt poisoning from the ocean because when you're severely dehydrated, you become irrational and delusional).


Now, you're probably thinking ""Hey, I bet I could paddle until I reached land.""  Nope, the average human male (5'10"", 180lbs, 18-24% body fat) needs 2400-2600 calories a day to maintain weight and energy levels (assuming a good balanced diet).  If you're very active (paddling a life raft for several hours a day would qualify), you'd need 3000 calories.  Your body basically starts eating itself around 7 days with no caloric intake.  Fat goes first, then muscle mass.  Look at some of the photos of the people in the Auschwitz concentration camp. and you'll see what I mean.   https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10829470/colourised-pics-auschwitz-horrors-hitlers-regime-75-years-ago/


Big picture is you're stranded.  After 7 days with no water, you're basically going to have a heart attack and die.  Some people have been known to go beyond that, but they're keeping themselves in a meditative state (doing little to know exercise).  


You're concentrating on the ""Big Picture"", but you fail to notice the boundaries.  Boundaries? Who needs them!  This guy who's going to die in 7 days if he doesn't get any water (not to mention food) needs boundaries.  Namely, a GPS device, or a transceiver radio, a sat phone, a mirror, or some other device that is capable of tele-communicating with another human being.  A clear sky would be nice too (tell east from west.... you know, the Sun rises in the East? Sets in the West?)  Also, a clear sky is nice for celestial navigation (if he has a sextant).  
All these things are boundaries.  So the teacher's and your argument holds very little weight.",1

I think it's incredible our genetic evolution. We like to believe we have come so far as a species but we are just taking baby steps in everything,. 
I think it's amazing all this information is just swirling around and all it take is active conscious awareness to piece it all together, 
That's what sets us apart. Our conscious self awareness, it's the fundamental to our existence. And whats setting us apart from animals such as apes..

"Nehmo Sergheyev why can't menstrual cycles cluster due to the influence of pheromones? This is an alternate hypothesis that needs to be ruled out. 

Deborah Whitehouse What is the evidence that menstrual synchrony is experienced by a great population?",1
"But don't you think a man can have deep insight on the subject? While subjective introspetive beliefs of individuals should not be ignored, if a large pool of empirical data contradicts subjective claims, you should probably trust the empirical data I would venture. A female urologist knows more about penises and testes than I ever will, in spite of me being a man. She has seen more penises and gathered more reports than me, on top of being well versed in the biology of the penis. If a female were to investigate some trait of the penis, she should take the subjective accounts of men into account, but if she gets overwhelming empirical evidence to support a claim about how a penis functions that is contradictory to what most men would claim based on subjective experience, you would likely be better off listening to the woman that happened to investigate the fenomenon in depth, than to listen to the men that avidly spoke against this based on their own intuitions on the matter that they got without investigating it thoroughly or delving into the depths of the details. To take a gender neutral example, psychologists (perhaps perticularly neuropsychologists) do listen to the introspective accounts of individuals when these individuals are describing their experiences, but they do not submit this as factual evidence if careful investigation shows that these introspective interpretations contradict the empirical data. I don't know enough about the specific case of menstrual synchronisation to make a comment on it in perticular, I'm just saying that subjective experiences seem untrustworthy. The situation could easily be reversed: a female scientist studying male reproductive organs and thereby knowing more about them and how hey function the avarage man does. And in general, science finds things that seem intuitively wrong every day. Don't you think a woman can know more about how erections function than the avarage man?",1
"What are your thoughts on this one year later, Deborah? I just started watching this lecture and scrolled utnil i found the comments that mentioned menstrual syncing was bunk. I have the same anecdotal evidence that you present, but i never sync'd up with the women i lived with, and have only experience extreme changes in my cycle when living on boats surrounded by men. I put it down to diet, i eat way less and very extremely different diet when at sea. I have never been on a boat yet with another woman.",1

"CesculuS_MoronicuS The free will assumption, that there is nothing that caused it. It’s just terrible assumption that there is nothing responsible for it, it’s self determined, self meaning without cause . Free will means without cause. Can you try thinking of something without an influence?
Free will means that all choices are made without cause. If something is caused by something else, it’s not free will.",1
"CesculuS_MoronicuS 
Are you attributing our free will come from God, and that we just don’t want to be responsible to God? If you are, when did it become a sign of being personally irresponsible to say that you want to take responsibility for your own life?",1
"goaliedude32 Free will is possible.

Freewill violates all known laws of nature, that's fine, there's no evidence that laws of nature are all there is to existence.

The second problem for Freewill is more interesting, freewill violates metaphysical causality. If a decision is made, it's either because there was a reason, or no reason at all. If there was a reason, then it's not free will, if there was no reason at all, then it's just random, right?

This argument does seem impenetrable, but it actually has a flaw.

We're assuming everything has a cause or a reason, but that assumption has a problem.

Think about the reason of everything.
The universe, the reason that the universe exists, the reason that that reason exists...and on and on
Eventually, you get 3 possible situations:

The chain of reason is circular
The chain of reason never ends, it goes on infinitely
The chain of reason ends, there exists something that doesn't have a reason or cause for existing.

For all three possibilities, there is a problem: the contents of the chain of reason could have been anything. Why is the sun flat? Because X1, why is X1? because X2...4...5...I can justify that the sun is flat.

Meaning, if any of the three possibilities are true, then existence could literately have been anything, and it can justify itself, FOR NO REASON. If there is a reason, then the reason is just one more chain in the chain of reasons.

So you see, it is possible for something to have no reason at all for being a certain way, and it just is.

All of existence hinges on something with no reason of existing whatsoever.

"What a superb lecture, Professor! I'd like to share a hypothesis for the mechanism of huntington's disease: I believe that the inadvertent methylation of the carbon 5, followed by spontaneous deamination of cytosines in CAGCAG triplet repeats form one or more stop codons TAG and when a certain threshold of the formation of stop codons exceeds the DNA glycosylases capacity to repair errors, truncated proteins will be produced and possibly causing the formation of peptides that could interfere with the nuclear pore complexes so that the truncated proteins would get stuck across and in the vicinity of the nuclear membrane; the same transformation of cytosines into thymines in CGA triplet repeats could produce stop codons in the neurons of Parkinson's patients; maybe this phenomenon is the primordial cause of other neurodegenerative diseases; do you think that ( provided my suppositions are correct) DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, like  azacytidine and decitabine, could delay the onset of such diseases?",1

"1-Considering the significance of statistical differences.
2-Recognition of Relatives 30:00. Intrasexual competition in female deer mice, (sperm). Sperm will cluster w/themselves. There is innate recognition of relatives.
Cross foster. They can recognize behaviorally it’s relatives. Sibling>half sibling even.
Olfactory signatures (eg. urine) and pheromone communication.
-Qualitative differences in the urine reflecting genetic makeup.
-mechanism for recognizing these differences.

The major histocompatability complex. Shared antigenic determinant. This sticks to all cells.
Immune System.Don’t attack said cell.

Autoimmune diseases think these are invasive.
Trypanosome.
Schistosome.

These are ultimately soluble. Give a unique signature to the pheromones coming off of you. They can tell if this is of a relative. There are gradations of recognition dependent on relatedness.
You have a specifically shaped protein receptor.
If the protein doesn’t fit exactly, then it’s a relative. Depending on how much and how long the proteins stay in the receptors.

Oxytocin, <-functions into pregnancy, then recognizing HSC signals. So then mother nurses.
Vasopressin.
Social anosmia. Inability to do it.
^High degree of this in families w/autism.

Adult neurogenesis.
Hippocampus.
Olfactory neurons are created. Females develop these olfactory neurons (and vaso and oxy have roles).

Why do you need to know who relatives are?
You know who to interact with. Nobody paid attention to dominance reversal if they were related.

Avoid inbreeding, genetic defects. (Opposing argument: kin selection.) Mate with something like a third cousin: that is the balance. 
McLintock study. Third cousins have the most attractive pheromones.

Olfactory receptors detect relatedness. Vasopressincand oxytocin create receptors. Prolactin is another way.

Noninnate recognition. Imprinting.
Innate learning.
Learn odor, voice etc.
goat, and sheep don’t have intrinsics.
Eg. The one who smells like my saliva I licked or my vaginal fluid etc. (based on own recognition of smell.)
Sociological facts can lead to clamation.

We do neither. We do it cognitively. We think about it and we figure it out.
Baboons can do this w/some degree of statistical thinking. Males around ovulation period.
Sunfish. The fish father separated gets upset when seeing them with the other male fish.

Fusiform cortex recognizes faces. Damped in autistic people. Mother=stranger=armchair.
Pidgins, goats, humans have it.

There is instinctual recognition of the mother by the baby through the histocompability complex, but it however has no relation to the father.. Can also recognize the voice of mom from the resonance through the ambiotic fluid.

Mating.
Joseph Schaffer. Kids raised Socialist communes in Israel.
Raised in same age group as somebody anywhere up to 6 years of age, you never wanted to mate with them. They seem like a brother or sister/sibling.

Yeah, but at that scale of data collection, such a predictable correlation is totally within statistical significance. Why do younger siblings sneeze more often during IQ tests?

"What? The fact you have a correlation doesn't mean it is non-random, that correlation could simply be random. Do you think all these are statistically significant? http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations

IQ tests themselves have a margin of error of about 5 points. I assume they factored that in though if not it could explain the difference.

You do know first born and later born have the same parents right? How would IQ being heritable or low IQ people having more children explain the difference between their first born and second born? Do you think parents genes change after they have a child?",1
"You stated that it isn't random because it correlates. Sample size doesn't matter randomness is always a factor. Clinical trials don't stop doing control groups after a certain sample point. It is always relevant to see whether the effects of a drug are more than simply random else you could think a drug works when it in fact does not.

Yes those things on that website correlate... You are missing the point. The fact you can find a correlation between two data sets doesn't mean you have discovered something significant. Also those graphs on the website are produced by an algorithm that scrapes through lots of data to randomly find correlations.

What was this logic of heritability prediction? Are you saying that single child households would skew the first born stats to have higher IQ because single child household parents typically have higher IQ? That would be a gross oversight by the people that did this study to conclude that first born were more intelligent than later born as single child households clearly tell you nothing about whether first born are more intelligent than their siblings as they don't have any siblings.",1

"Robert Olvera, did you not even watch the video?",1
"Nafaa Boutefer the evidence for the evolution theory is overwhelming. You have not looked very well. 
And a lot of questions arise when evolution theory was not true. 
For instance, why do mammals have bulging wet eyes? Dry eyes would be a lot more efficient in a dry environment. 
Why do humans have such bad backs and knees? So badly equipped for standing upright. 
Why do chicken carry dna for making teeth? Why do monkeys and humans have the same dna to fight viruses that do not exist anymore? 
And why do industrial processes making use of evolution theory work so well?",1
"I think you don't know what' the definition of ""evidence"". According to the dictionary.cambridge.org
Evidence is: ""one or more reasons for believing that something is or is not true."", does your evidence meet this definition?
All those questions cannot prove the evolution theory is true. Even if it answers those questions (which it didn't), many more can arise too. 
1- why do industrial processes making use of evolution theory work so well?
 This doesn't prove in any form or shape that the evolution theory is true. We can adapt any process to solve industry problems, this is in the hands of humans. If you find it good for many problems, it's not good for many too, doesn't this prove that it's false? I don't think that you believe this is evidence, you just try to find things that support your believe, and force yourself to accept them.
2-  Why do monkeys and humans have the same DNA to fight viruses that do not exist anymore? 
This doesn't mean that monkeys and humans have the same ancestor, or that one evolved from the other. This is why the evolution theory is just a theory. If humans share 96% of DNA with monkeys (Chimpanzee in particular), why don't we say that the monkeys evolved from Humans? Why don't we say that we are the ancestors of monkeys? Where did the other 4% go? Come on, this is not evidence, this is just guessing.
3- Why do chicken carry DNA for making teeth? I don't know about this. still doesn't prove that it evolved from something that have teeth. Still guessing here.
4- Why do humans have such bad backs and knees? is this evidence too? even that the word `bad` here is subjective, this doesn't mean that we evolved. If we say the creator who created us chose to make us that way. that solves it. the question will be, why did he chose to make us that way. That's a good question to answer.
5- Why do mammals have bulging wet eyes? Dry eyes would be a lot more efficient in a dry environment. If that's true,  why didn't the eye evolved to become a dry eye? Can evolution answer this?

All those questions can be answered very easily if you accept that all was created by an all knowing, all powerful, the most wise creator, Allah. The simplest answer is 'he chose to make it like that'.  Then you can ask them in a different way, not to prove a theory, but to know the reason why all that is like that. Which is much more beneficial then your theory. 
I hope that you bring evidence that we cannot deny the way Islam does. A bunch of questions are not evidence.",1

Or second suggest that fossilization happened a few thousand years ago, during a flood. 
Both options don't get you very far. There are so many people finding fossils all the time in rocks, and why would a god take the effort to put them there?

I'm not sure why you're changing the topic here (and I strongly think you're trying to say something else), but some of the things that are ""laws"" in our universe (things like space and time) were created at the moment of the Big Bang. What existed before is unknown to us.

You’re right, because they are two totally different things.

“Evolution is not scientifically possible.”

Actually it is and has been proven so.

“According to people who believe in only science life is an impossibility.”

Completely untrue.

“life cannot come from non life"" 

No logical scientifically minded person believes that.  Studies and experiments have shown this to be untrue.

“so how am i supposed to just accept that life has always existed”

Well on earth it hasn’t.

“and the laws of nature created themselves via the laws of nature?”

“If mother nature really ruled everything... why do human beings exist?”

Why do volcanoes exist?  They have caused the deaths of a few species.

“We treat earth like it exists to sustain us. Why haven't we been killed off by nature so that nature can sustain itself for as long as possible?”

Because “Mother Nature” isn’t self aware.  There are factors other than humans that “Mother Nature” could deal with, but it won’t.

"+Martin Kunev Evolution is a flawed ""Theory"" Even Darwin admitted it had problems. If you look closely at biological systems a lot of them can not function if you take away a single component. Take for instance an eye ball, If you take away 1 single ingredient of all that it takes to make an eye ball function it will not work at all...so how did an eye ball evolve from a single cell creature if it can not work unless all parts are there. The probability of a single protein required in the building blocks of life life being created from random chance is like 1 to the 167th power (I am not sure of the exact number)  for 1 single part. So the explanation for 100's of billions of years for evolution to take place in reality it would take 100's of times longer to have made 1 single protein to even start the process of life. Also of you look at just the biological systems of the human body it would seem each system is very complex and for all the complex systems to work together (skeletal, muscular, cardio vascular, nervous and so on) to make us work seems to me to have a specific purpose which suggest a design for then all to work together. If you have a design then you have to have a designer. This planet is also in the perfect location in the universe for all this to support life.

1. Some Christians do believe in Evolution, I think the Pope says it's fine. There are some who believe in a Young Earth - (6000 year old Earth), which doesn't really fit with the idea of Evolution which needs millions of years.

2. I used the term 'religious' in a broad sense. Not all religious people are anti-science, but many of them will choose their beliefs over science if there is conflict. Religion is completely based on faith, and faith is not compatible with science. It's good that your imam supports you to follow science, but what if he didn't? Would you still? What would you tell other muslim people who are told not to follow science. If life is discovered on Mars or Pluto, but your religion tells you that only Earth has life on it. Then at this point do you accept the science/reject religion or reject the science and continue to  believe what your teachings tell you?

3. There are many reasons for humans to engage in violence, religion is just one of them. Some atheists are nice, some aren't. Some religious people are nice, some aren't. They are all just human.

""but we have moral and ethical bases that have done so much help keeping the society stable"" Are you referring to religious teaching here? Do you mean that religion is the basis for morals? I wouldn't agree that religion is the basis of morals, but I could agree that an organisation or belief system can help with controlling the way people act towards each other. However this isn't exclusive to religions.
I can't imagine what it's like to live in Iraq, must be a completely different world over there. I think the place you live is a very special case where it might seem like religion is the key to a stable society. But living in a different society may give you different ideas as to what is important to a stable society eg. education/opportunities/equality/safety/freedom of expression etc. Fear of god is not always going to be relevant to the stability of a society.
I think you can be religious and still accept science. But there may be a day when those ideas conflict - it depends on what your religious beliefs are.
A person who believes in Adam and Eve is going to have a hard time fitting them into the theory of evolution. (some people try this and come up with their own theories as to how it works, but this is kind of dishonest of them as they really try to cram in their beliefs into a scienctific theory which doesn't allow for it.)

  Yes indeed evolution and its symbiotic relationship to atheism  is a religion! By claiming there is not a God or Spiritual dimension to our Universe are you not as well making a metaphysical claim about the nature of reality? Hasn't the dangerous and destructive books of Darwin risen to the status of the 'sacred texts' of materialism? 
Furthermore, don't leftist fundamentalists(atheists) defend their faith with a hateful and insulting religious like fervor that your most die hard fundamentalist from the far Right of the political./religious 
spectrum fail to emulate?  Don't atheists have their own creation stories as provided by the destructive myth of evolution? ...please note, ""creation stories"" in this context is not limited to only Origins but to the complexity and diversity of life as well.   
Instead of getting your indoctrination in a Church don't you get your 
indoctrination into the destructive myth of evolution from leftist 
Universities sanctioned by the 'State' or the infamous 1%. And

What book are you talking about? Because there has been more than one I have read in my search for the truth such as:The design Revolution by William Dembski, Darwins Black Box by Michael Behe or Darwins Doubt by Stephen C. Meyers and The Greatest Hoax on Earth, Refuting Dawkins on Evolution by Jonathan Sarfariti?

No I did NOT ""quote Mine"" I suggest you revisit the definition of quote mine.  Of course evolution and its symbiotic relationship to atheism is a faith! Please go back and review my previous post. If you allowed yourself to be exposed to the mounting criticisms against Darwinism by some of the best minds on the planet  and took the time to learn what current science is saying about the overwhelming complexity of living systems, unless you need evolution to be true in order to justify your atheism, you will quickly realize that it takes infinitely more ""Faith"" to be an evolutionist than it does to believe that a Divine Intelligence played a part in the creation of the Universe and all life in it.

""I'm not making any ""metaphysical"" claims...""*
 Of course you are! Its just that Your metaphysical claims are simply the polar opposite of the Theist claim that there is a Universal Mind at the heart of our reality.
""But evolution is proved true across multiple fields of study....""* 
No, It hasn't, Can you give one scientific quantitative fact that proves that evolution is a ""fact"".. and what ""fields of study"" are you talking about? The truth is, every discipline of science that we have today would have progressed quite nicely if evolution was never invented. In addition, had mainstream science not been hamstrung by the rule of methodological naturalism we might have understood even more about the world we live in than we currently do.

""We have the evidence...""*
What evidence?  and please do not give examples of micro-evolution or the idea that just because animals, past and present, share similar physical features(homology} I can't even begin to tell you how weak an argument that is.

""You can just do some research and you could learn everything you need to know, without quote mining. FACT ....""*""
So can You. think about this, Theists don't necessarily need the myth of evolution to be false but atheists absolutely NEED the the myth of evolution to be true. because if one piece of evidence, no matter how small, that an intelligence played a role in creating the diversity and complexity of life on this planet is accepted by the mainstream many people could no longer maintain the 'atheist identity' they have created for themselves.
Other than simply not wanting to be reminded that there are now many intelligent and highly educated  people who do not buy into the destructive myth of evolution and atheism. what makes you think I'm quote mining?
“I now believe there is a God...I now think it [the evidence] does point to a creative Intelligence almost entirely because of the DNA investigations. What I think the DNA material has done is that it has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which which are needed to produce life, that intelligence must have been involved in getting these extraordinarily diverse elements to work together.”

""[Darwin] was embarrassed by the fossil record because it didn't look the way he predicted it would.... Well, we are now about 120+ years after Darwin, and knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much.... [W]e have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time.""
 --- David M. Raup, ""Conflicts Between Darwin and Paleontology,"" Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin﻿

""1st, as far as metaphysical claims, im not making any claims. im just denying yours...""
Metaphysics = the branch of philosophy that deals with the 'first principles of things', including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space.

 Of course you are! Its just that Your metaphysical claims are that fundamentally, the universe is a cold, heartless, unintelligent place and that all life and phenomenon are simply the result of mindless, lucky  random acts of nature. existing with no purpose or inspiration.  A narrow view of reality which is, again, the polar opposite of the Theist claim that there is a Universal Mind at the heart of our reality.

""do you not realize how out of date darwin is? weve learned so much since then. and you silly guy..""
 What are some, or even one, significant difference between evolution in Darwins day and evolution today?
Today, as in Darwin's day, the theory was used as an attempt to explain the complexity and diversity of life without the need of an intelligent agent. Just like Darwin, most of today atheists deny the existence of an intelligent agent at the heart of creation because they are simply mad at God or just plain angry... Darwin lost his faith and became angry at God after his young daughter died. Just as in Darwin's day, today's evolutionists have never witnessed evolution actually taking place beyond micro-evolution.

Darwin had no transitional fossils available to back up his theory and still to this day Darwinist's lack transitional fossils to back up their beliefs. And finally, The concept of Natural Selection is as important to evolution today as it was in Darwin's day.

""if we didnt understand evolution as we do, we wouldnt have any flu shots...""
Actually, the development of flu vaccines has nothing to do with evolution! to develop vaccines scientist simply weaken or kill the target virus so that when injected into the body the virus does little to no harm. while allowing the body's 'intelligently' designed immune system time to develop anti-bodies to this perceived threat. anti-bodies that will be ready the next time the body is exposed to the virus.

""youre silly as hell. we dont need evolution to be true, it just describes reality...""
Why do atheists feel the need to always insult? I would think that if you were confident in you views and had the science to back it up insults and straw-man arguments would not be necessary...insults are a bit childish don't you think?
 Why don't atheists need their religion of  evolution to be true? If you believe that I can only conclude that you have not thought it out very well.

""go back to your god and leave the scientists alone. just because you theists dont want to know the truth, keep that in church...""
Ahh yes, more mindless insults and straw-men. You may not have the level of consciousness to understand this yet but when you have to say something like that in the place of actual facts taken from science, philosophy or history it becomes quite apparent that you are the one who does not want to know the truth.  atheists should keep it in the State controlled, aka... the infamous 1%, public schools

“Darwinism by itself did not produce the Holocaust, but without Darwinism...neither Hitler nor his Nazi followers would have had the necessary scientific underpinnings to convince themselves and their

"ford6768 Funny that you would quote Einstein, when you're a Christian. Sure, he was a certain kind of Agnostic Pantheistic Deist(-ish) (more like in his view, the universe IS god), but you should read what he said about the Christian view of religion and god!

Einstein's view on Christians beliefs:
""From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist. ... It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the human sphere—childish analogies.""
=== So Einstein threw that whole ""God the 'Father', God the 'Son', God the Holy Spirit"" thing out the window!

And the Bible?
""The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.""

"shaqpopcorn34 Your use of the world ""religion"" to describe evolution... what do you consider to be a religion? Sorry, I was a linguist (now a business student), so etymology and correct word usage matters to me. If you're going to use a word, please understand what it means. What do you think ""religion"" is? What does it mean to you?

Also, that doesn't change the fact that the earliest natural science observers were Christians - the people who figured out how DNA and genetics work, which was later built upon by Charles Darwin, and studied further (and sometimes fixed) by people who came later. Without the early Christian geneticists exploring ""forbidden"" topics (forbidden because it was taboo to understand ""how God's mysteries worked""), we would not understand how genetics work, and so we would not understand evolution.

Besides answering the question of what you think a ""religion"" is, please educate me as to why the pyramids sustained no water damage, and why Jesus thought the mustard seed was the smallest in all the world. Fyi - I've checked out the Greek and the Hebrew, that's definitely what Jesus said.",1

And then constructed one from a rib?
If he can make things from nothing, where does he need the fucking rib for?

And that all happened six thousand years ago?
Why then do we have chinese, black, brown and white people?

They evolved from two people in a few thousand years?

And why did he make all these fossils and earth layers? To freak us out?

Why did he bother to put DNA for teeth in a chicken? And DNA for a tail in humans? Because God has a wonderful sense of humor?

"shaqpopcorn34 Etymology means ""origin"". It's not a Communist term, it's an English word - before Communism ever existed.

The etymology of the word ""religion"" requires there to be a belief in a god (or gods). If an ideology does not believe in a god (or gods), then it's not a religion.

Capitalism is not a religion. Communism is not a religion. Republicanism is not a religion. Democracy is not a religion. Those are systems - not religions. Evolution is a scientific theory - and since it does not require a belief in any god, then it's impossible for it to be a religion.

Therefore, you are making incompatible statements by referring to any of them as ""religions"".

"   The presence of background carbon 14 is not distinguishable from ""true"" carbon 14, hence why the study I assume you are referring to conflated them. The ICR (Institute for Creation Research) recently spent eight years on a project known as RATE (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth). The RATE team claims the results have yielded convincing and irrefutable scientific evidence of a young earth.

John Baumgardner, a geophysicist with expertise in tectonic modeling, presents experimental data claiming to show that all biological material contains intrinsic radiocarbon, no matter how old that material may be thought to be . He makes additional claims that even non-biological carbonaceous material contains intrinsic radiocarbon. He suggests that this radiocarbon is residual from the material’s creation. If true, his claims would have far-reaching implications for the ages of these materials.
Baumgardner presents two classes of data. The first is a set of 90 previously published radiocarbon AMS dates of old samples (most >100k years) that he has re-analyzed. The second is a set of new samples that the RATE team collected and sent to a leading radiocarbon AMS laboratory to be dated. In both cases, I am convinced that the “intrinsic radiocarbon” is nothing more than contamination and instrument background.

 Radioisotope evidence presents significant problems for the young earth position. Baumgardner and the RATE team are to be commended for tackling the subject, but their “intrinsic radiocarbon” explanation does not work. The previously published radiocarbon AMS measurements can generally be explained by contamination, mostly due to sample chemistry. The RATE coal samples were probably contaminated in situ. RATE’sprocessed diamond samples were probably contaminated in the sample chemistry. The unprocessed diamond samples probably reflect instrument background. Coal and diamond samples have been measured by others down to instrument background levels, giving no evidence for intrinsic radiocarbon.

While some materials, e.g., coals and carbonates, often do show radiocarbon contamination that cannot be fully accounted for, resorting to“intrinsic radiocarbon” raises more questions than it answers. Why do only some materials show evidence of this intrinsic radiocarbon? Why does some anthracite and diamond exist with no measurable intrinsic radiocarbon? Why is its presence in carbonates so much more variable than in other materials, e.g., wood and graphite? Why is it often found in bone carbonates but not in collagen from the same bone? Since intrinsic radiocarbon would be mistakenly interpreted as AMS process background, why do multi-laboratory intercomparisons not show a much larger variation than is observed? Why does unprocessed diamond seem to have less intrinsic radiocarbon than processed diamond?

These and many other considerations are inconsistent with the RATEhypothesis of “intrinsic radiocarbon” but are consistent with contamination and background. “Intrinsic radiocarbon” is essentially a “radiocarbon-of-the-gaps” theory. As contamination becomes better understood, the opportunities to invoke “intrinsic radiocarbon” will diminish. Most radiocarbon measurements of old materials, including many of shells and coal, can be accounted for by known contamination mechanisms, leaving absolutely no evidence for intrinsic radiocarbon. The evidence falsifies the RATE claim that “all carbon in the earth contains a detectable and reproducible level of 14C”",1

Nothing can ever be truly proven ""ever"" just like you cant disprove anything. But you can have extremely probable theories for example the theory that the world orbits the sun or the theory that the earth is round 

""Simple to understand is truth"" you mean to say anything that ever gets complicated is obviously completely false, sorry but you are an egotistical ignorant narcissist are you really that blind to information that you believe there can only be one way to look at things and thats your way. 

""Complicated is ideal for maniplulating"" that doesn't mean everything that is complicated is manipulated.

Who ever said there was ever any half monkey half man? Only you and your numb skull religious followers, you dont understand anything about even the basics of evolution and you too ignorant to try and learn because what you think is right or whatever the bible says is right.

 This is a copy paste from the basics of evolution 

It is possible for the DNA of an organism to occasionally change, or mutate. A mutation changes the DNA of an organism in a way that affects its offspring, either immediately or several generations down the line.The change brought about by a mutation is either beneficial, harmful or neutral. If the change is harmful, then it is unlikely that the offspring will survive to reproduce, so the mutation dies out and goes nowhere. If the change is beneficial, then it is likely that the offspring will do better than other offspring and so will reproduce more. Through reproduction, the beneficial mutation spreads. The process of culling bad mutations and spreading good mutations is called natural selection. As mutations occur and spread over long periods of time, they cause new species to form. Over the course of many millions of years, the processes of mutation and natural selection have created every species of life that we see in the world today, from the simplest bacteria to humans and everything in between.

Billions of years ago, according to the theory of evolution, chemicals randomly organized themselves into a self-replicating molecule. This spark of life was the seed of every living thing we see today (as well as those we no longer see, like dinosaurs). That simplest life form, through the processes of mutation and natural selection, has been shaped into every living species on the planet.

""Do tell me where man came from then "" ok so we both have theories here your theory is that a magical man called yahweh who is omnipresent, omnipotent and benevolent made a man from dirt  then a women from a rib done all over, and the theory that i believe in is that billions of years ago according to the theory of evolution, chemicals randomly organized themselves into a self-replicating molecule. This spark of life was the seed of every living thing we see today and dont see today 

Woah two pretty unbelievable circumstances but since this yahweh has left me no proof of his existence even though he is omnipresent and omnipotent and benevolent all he has left me is a book written 1000's of years ago by halfwits and what about all the other gods which one do i pick? How about neither because i dont want to be fretting all my life about if im going to heaven or hell since neither are real and if you're talking about evidence where's yours for heaven?

This is where humans came from

So tell me why didnt yahweh, omnipresent and omnipotent and all knowing create a book that would contain every answer to any question man would ever ask? So there would be no confusion?
And if you say that book would be too big I'm talking about an endless book, a magical book, surely he would has the power to do that if he can defy the laws of physics

""College level biology"" didn't allow you to observe evolution in truth because it does not occur in the real world it's pure fantasy..why isn't evolution recorded on anything else besides a book or drawn in paintings and taught to children in little story books? Because it doesn't happen in the real world..finding a fossil in the ground proves nothing about anything..watching a bird migrate and change it's habits 100 times hasn't ever allowed us to see a bird change into something besides a bird the suggestion that such things occur in reality can be concluded as false via observation with or without a college degree in the same way I don't need a PHD to tell you that an ultra sound can predict a problem with a child early on but until birth there is almost nothing they can do about any problems it's simple common sense..""if God exists how come I've never seen him?""

"Shrey Mittal did I witness my religion occur..no but many people did and wrote about the events they saw transpire before their very eyes..even Darwin himself never observed evolution..for the last time I do not need to argue religion or biblical literalism..what we observed is a bird changing its habits, sure birds change habits and sometimes lose the ability to produce offspring..they are still birds..(you are assuming without solid evidence that with enough time and change of habits that biology will change as well) fossils cannot prove anything again you darwinian evolutionists severely messed up hallucigenia translated it upside down..if you can accidently translate a fossil from Z to A instead of A to Z what else could you have gotten wrong? Furthermore how are those fossils dated? By the strata? And how is the strata dated? Mmhm the fossil record. Okay how is the fossil record dated? Oh yeah by the strata? So the strata is dated by the fossil record and the fossil record is dated by the strata..hello circular reasoning, met you in third grade! 😂 A fossil in the ground proves nothing because you don't know whether a fossil even had offspring, it's a fossil..also the fact that there are millions of fossils suggests to me that they were put there by a flood..have you ever created a fossil? You realize how easy they are to make and how little time it takes right? You are aware that people have fossilized fakes and glued them together to ""prove"" darwinian evolution as with the case in national geographic right? I mean the damn thing had the whole cover of NatGeo magazine You are aware that a cowboys boot was found with his leg still in it fossilized right? Was the cowboy prehistoric? I think darwinism has blown itself out of proportion it's okay to have an inkling of something and to believe something, even to believe you have evidence of something but it is totally wrong to swindle children out of the truth intentionally telling them darwinism is fact..how likely could it be that darwins grandfather just imagined the truth one day and then Darwin taught it to people and then scientists discovered it was the world's only truth? 😅 I don't think you realize how crazy it sounds..",1
Shrey Mittal isn't darwinism just a story set in books and preached through art? Has anyone observed on creature turn into another creature as with the human evolving from a common ancestor of the app etc..I challenge you not to distort the definition of evolution birds changing habits and losing fertility is just what animals do..a human can travel anywhere on earth and change all of their habits completely for seven generations and that will do what? Make his offspring evolve? Haha hasn't DNA and the subsequent loss of information in genes from generation to generation disproven this little darwinian delusion?,1
Shrey Mittal who painted the Mona Lisa? How do you know that did you meet him?,1
"Shrey Mittal right off the bat he says ""evolution it's a thing it's not a debate"" does he mean to say evolution is actual and not theoretical? That evolution is unfalsifiable and also tangible? First of all, if evolution is unfalsifiable then it isn't scientific science doesn't have absolutes such as certainty..If evolution is actual and tangible then we should be able to record it via observation..is evolution a ""thing"" i.e. a gadget, utensil, artifact, entity, and a body? Where is the ""body"" of evolution? I'm holding a glass of red wine..where is it's body? Well it's tangible and I know this because it's ""body"" is observable to all five of my senses I can hear its subtle and gentle sound as I pour the ""body"" of the wine into my cup. As I pull the cup closer to my face I can smell the ""body"" of the wine and as I sit the wine I can feel it's chill and taste it's sweetness..these prerequisites are what comprises a ""thing"" evolution is a ""theory"" because it is a supposition or system of ideas designed to explain something..words synonymous with ""theory"" my favorite is ""conjecture"" if you say evolution is a theory and then say it is a thing not a debate you are also saying it's a ""conjecture"" for which there can be no debate..how can one not debate a system of ideals with a contrary system of ideals? If this weren't possible darwinism shouldn't even be credible enough to be taught in a college as it's simply a philosophical preference to teleology and theology..am I really debating English with a college student?",1
Matthew McArthur if this theory is so fake to you even with SO MUCH evidence supporting it. what do you think caused this. a creator? that idea is backed by zero solid evidence. so you’d shut down the theory with so much support cause your petty yet you support a conjecture which was written in one place...,1
"Shrey Mittal I keep telling you again and again about the bacterial flagellum, so tired of repeatedly giving you solid evidence that totally refutes darwinism..Darwin said ""if any biological construct could be shown that it would be impossible for such a construct to be made gradually over time then my theory would totally break down"" the bacterial flagellum is a fully functioning motor that runs on acids and just the subtraction of 7 proteins would render the entire design dysfunctional..there is no evidence of a creator? Again what about the bacterial flagellum? Please debate me on that after you've actually studied it..",1
Shrey Mittal trial and error without intelligence could produce nothing..I admire the faithful atheism of evolution but could we please see evolution occur before we start assuming that it does..could we actually debate real science please? Evolution is so fake and imaginative..we assume evolution occurred and then the presentation of evidence starts..but evidence isn't proof. If I painted a pig purple that can be cited as evidence that pigs are purple..but pigs are not purple indeed..,1
Shrey Mittal by what means am I contradicting myself? The bacterial flagellum could not have evolved..irreducible complexity and specified complexity are concepts of creation science which is a contrary theory to darwinian evolution check mate sister..,1
"Shrey Mittal no we literally have not..we have never witnessed a single cell organism evolve into a more complex organsim with more cells such as a multi-million cell organsim like a human..outside of the assumption that evolution occurred it has no tangibility..any evidence of evolution presented is based upon the assumption that evolution occurred..your arguments aren't even weak tea they are spring water..darwinian evolution could never be proven and even the most astute and staunch defenders of the concept of evolution know it..how is it possible to prove scientifically that everything biological in the world arose from the same cell? We see cells reproduce and replicate sure..but they never honestly change from their microbiological state..they stay the same with extremely minor variations which in my opinion is evidence of creation these minute variations had to be genetically designed as a system before they occurred that's just an assumption though..again evolution is a ""theory"" and by being a ""theory"" and being admitted to be a theory it cannot be observed..for having a college level understanding of biology you have a pretty baser understanding of English..I use improper grammar sure, but all Americans do...I respect your intelligence and appreciate you taking the time to debate with me but honestly neither my religion or yours has been ""proven"" per se..if darwinism is any different from my religion philosophically how come when I say things like ""darwinism = imagination"" people respond by comparing it to Christianity if darwinism is truly different then religious beliefs why not contrast it rather than make it more comparible?",1
Shrey Mittal not really..a penguin doesn't fly sure..but even a two year old could compare and contrast that a pidgeon and a penguin are both birds..your distortion of truth doesn't have to be seen as truth for the person questioning it to be intelligent..college level biology what a mockery of truth..what level of a degree do I need before I can actually observe evolution occur?,1
Shrey Mittal why do I need proof of my religion? How is my religion comparible to darwinian evolution if darwinian evolution isn't religious and is supposedly contrasting to religion in it's totality? You should skip biology and study darwinism in a philosophical setting..it doesn't last a fort night in philosophy..,1
Shrey Mittal your saying the great flood was falsified by science? Wait a minute aren't religious views and scientific views separate? Then how does a scientific view falsify a religious one? SCIENCE doesn't pay attention to theories enough to even attempt to falsify them without admitting simultaneously that they are inherently scientific..check mate again lass..,1

Let's see ""the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life"" predict the future. The author of a book doesn't increase nor decrease the validity of the information contained within the book itself..I know it is quite frustrating that you cannot just dismiss the author because the authors are anonymous..fossils are no problem for the fact that the earth was created as fossils rapidly appear in floods constantly we cannot even honestly say the fossils are prehistoric as radio carbon dating has already been admitted to have carbon contamination problems..there are fossils of modern cats, dogs, deer, even a fossil of a cowboys boot with his legbone still inside..those aren't ""pre-historic""..",1
"Eliza Clift-millar speaking of a book being outdated why did we remove over 90% of the title of ""the origin of species"" because it's an outdated book written by an author who didn't have the credentials to even guess the origin of life and he was a sexist, racist,  pig, 6 people attended his funeral..all studied at a college level was botany..""Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for god hath shewed it unto them. for the invisible things of him  from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god, neither were thankful, but became vain in their IMAGINATIONS and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing themselves to be ""wise"" they became FOOLS, and changed the image of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds four-footed beasts and creeping things (Darwinian Doctrine) wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.

Tarzan Vader how are unvaccinated children a danger to vaccinated children if vaccines work?? Lolz,1
"Eliza Clift-millar even if vaccines did work which they don't but let us say that they do just to be generous to your argument and to humor my argument..this is still not evidence of evolution..creatures both microscopic and macroscopic do tend to vary and change traits but a micro-organism has always been a micro-organism and a macro-organism is in a separate class..never have we ever been able to join these inherently separate classes together (as evolution teaches us) nobody who disagrees with Darwinism is in denial of anything..a micro-organism evolving into a macro-organism has never been observed so to deny that is really the same as denying any other imaginative thing i.e. santa claus, tooth fairy, hell if you don't believe in God because you can't see him why believe in evolution? Both sides present evidence and only the Bible predicts the future to a ""T"" so again I'll mock you and say ""continue to live in denial"" of the fact that evolution might not be real at all..tbh I think its totally fake and there is honestly no proof so why not abandon evolution it's a dumb theory to which the great allure of is separating teleological concepts of thought from physical concepts of nature..science isn't philosophy and thus Darwinism is infeasible as a scientific theory and more of a dumb philosophy of arrogance that claims the only god of man is man?

"+Grace Troyer
Of course the ancestor were the same species. Evolution is speciation from 1 species splitting into 2 species when they can't smoothly or successfully crossbreed anymore. 
 Species split into 2 variations until those variations can't crossbreed anymore.
 Species Equini split into Astrohippus, Dinohippus and Equus, 
Equus split into donkeys, horses, zebras, kiangs, onager 
Horses split into draft horses, racing horses and ponies. 
Ponies split into known pony breeds like shetland ponies and Dartmoor ponies. 
While Zebras split into mountain zebras, grevy zebras and plain zebras and 
plain zebras split into quaggas, which were killed by humans. 
So are humans the savannah adapted variation of the very same ape, where chimpanzees and bonobos are jungle adapted variations from.

When you reverse all the splitting apart into subvariations and subsubvariations and subsubsubvariations you and go back in time all existing animals incl. humans came from 1 lifeform, which split apart, and each split splitted apart again and again.
This is what we can read in the genes directly and what we see in the fossil record as well.

"Jon Mark
The DNA doesn't instruct the body to do anything specific. It instructs a cell to create proteins in a certain sequence and  continue.

Proteins are self organizing (proteins will interact with other proteins depending on type and there are many). On top of that cells are self organizing.

We have at least three layers of self organizing systems and DNA has lots of typos in it. An important difference between humans and other primates has been actually found to be a gene stuck on the A key. No kidding. An important genetic marker coordinating when the skull will harden has several times the duplicate base sequences in it than a chimp or gorilla. What does it do? It makes the skull grow for a longer time before switching to solidifying the bone skull plates. It's essentially just an iterator telling cells to do stuff more often than it would in chimp DNA. What is the cascading effect? We humans get largest skull growth of all primates out of it.",1
"I would like to reply to your last statement. You agree, by saying that 'micro evolution' occurs, that modification through descent occurs, by natural, or artificial selection. (I am also including your writings on information, in the other comments.)

 THAT IS EVOLUTION!!!! The build up of these 'micro mutations' over MILLIONS, of years can create very diverse species. Your statement on mutations being harmful is wrong. You say that mutations only damage DNA, or at least their 'information', but you then say that something is information if it is understandable. If a mutation causes a bird to have longer wings, it is understandable, and by your definition, still 'information'. This is also beneficial to organisms, as you also claimed as requirement for information. Over 10's, 100's, or 1,000's, 10,000's, 100,000's, 1,000,000's of generations, birds that benefit from these longer wings, and further mutations to make it even longer, increase the average length of the wing over time. Until we get something we might call a different species, with the longer time that passes meaning the more diverse it will become, and keeping in mind population mechanics. Smaller populations have a greater genetic drift, and larger populations having a slower. As long as all mutations were beneficial, this follows evolution. Your claim that all mutations are detrimental, is wrong, and shows that you do not understand what a mutation is. And once you accept that not all mutations are detrimental, you will understand what modification through descent by natural selection means. Traits that are bad for the organism, decrease it's chance of living to reproduce. Traits that are beneficial for the organism, will increase it's chance of living to reproduce. It is random as to what the given trait is, that is the ONLY random part of evolution.

Secondly, DNA does not limit mutation, are you telling me, that all breeders should be fired, because their job does nothing? If you breed only the fastest and strongest horses over several generations in a given population, are you telling me that there offspring will not be stronger? Now what if you take that offspring, and breed only their strongest, will their descendants not also be stronger then their ancestors? And so on and so on? Are you going to tell me that their is a cap as to the amount of change that can occur? If so, please link me this, world changing paper. 

What about dogs? You aren't going to tell me that they weren't bred, even though we call them breeds? These are organisms, that through modification through descent, gained valued mutations. Valued by that of the breeder. You can't possibly disagree with this, or any other form of breeding. Why can this not occur in nature?

 I would enjoy a reply, and if you wish, I can reply to your other statements. I might on my own accord break down the flood that you also mentioned, as I look over it again.

Understand that evolution is only a theory and it requires faith, believing in the unseen, and that applies for creation as well.
That one that need some understanding here is you. 
A: There are no such thing as ""only"" a theory in science. The scientific term theory is not the same thing as the common word theory. A scientific theory is an explanation modell that describe a core of facts or a observed phenomena. A scientific theory is the highest form of explanation modell you will find in science. 
Phrasing this like you just did only reveal your ignorance in science. 
B: Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.This is easy to observe. We can both see short term examples of this through genetic comparisons, we can see it in breeding of animals and plants for certain traits, we can see it in viruses that change year by year as they get exposed to antibiotics. We have even observed speciation, both in the wild and in controlled environments. Claiming that you need some sort of faith here is just plain wrong. 


It takes knowledge of both subjects to determine what the evidence best leads to but if a evolutionist has only been exposed to their own theory, then what's the point?
You fail to realize that evolution isn't a claim, it's a conclusion drawn from the evidence. And do you honestly believe that no professional active in this field never have heard of all the various religious claims that you will fond out there? Really? Heck, even some of the leading biologists right now are religious. 


Also realize that evidence supporting evolution is constantly being debunked by scientists, even ones particular to this subject.

Education includes learning about different ways of thinking: deduction, induction, estimation, aesthetic appraisal, etc, with emphasis upon in what kind of circumstances each is useful. There is nothing wrong with teaching evolution, so long as you explain how that conclusion was reached (scientific method). It is unreasonable to present children with the evidence and expect them to reach the conclusion themselves: so far, only one human has ever stumbled across that realisation unaided. Would you, by a similar logic, neglect to tell children that the world is round and expect them to realise it themselves by showing them noon-time shadows of differing length? Equally ridiculous.

Do you accept mathematics as a reasonable form of logic? 
Yes


What do evolutionary biologists consider to be a reasonable estimate for an average number of generations per fixed mutation? I don't understand your question.
 
By fixed mutation I mean a mutation that has successfully percolated through a species to the point that it has become permanently established at %100 frequency and is now part of the dominant form of the species. 


A mutation that is 100% across a species would be extremely important for that species survival or due to some environmental barrier that prevented genetic flow. This could happen in a single generation.


 How many fixed mutation would you estimate seperate humans from the common ancestors shared with chimpanzees? 


I have no idea. Using your definition of fixed mutation the calculation would be as numerous as there have been people * chimps that has ever lived multiplied by 6*10^9.  


The chimpanzee genome project catalogues 35,000,000 single nucleotide changes, 5,000,000 insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal arrangements. So, that much change has occurred historically but we can't get bacteria to change significantly at all?
 
I am cautiously optimistic about your numbers because single nucleotide changes or SNP's is my specialty. There are more than 10 million across humans alone. there's like .1% difference in humans and a 4% difference from chimps. That's a 40 fold difference. So a difference of 35m  between us and chimps seems a bit low. I could be wrong.
We have changed bacteria quite dramatically. How do you not know this? There are more than a billion bacteria species and at best 400 species of primates(check my number I'm a not a zoologist) . I hope you like math as a logical tool also.



Does that make you curious? 
Yes that's why I became a scientist. 



Anybody on here agree that either the math doesn’t add up or we should be able to demonstrate more change with bacteria that have a new generation within hours? 
I agree your math does not add up.


Dogs can still breed that’s not equivalent to whale evolution or dinosaurs gaining the ability of flight.


If I understand your comment:
The domestication of dogs and subsequent artificial selection has only been going on for about 30-50k years. Don't be quite so harsh on the canine for not being able to fly. The dinos had some 65 million years to learn. I am pleased you picked dogs. Here's why. First of all, mating and production of viable offspring is NOT a determinate factor for species. At one time I was taught that it was but it is not.

"If science has such a solid understanding of evolution then let them explain the step by step process of how animals or any animal has developed into and other species or Kind. How would the anatomy be able to incrementally change while maintaining functionality, reproductivity, the necessary food chain and localized proximity for the corresponding mate that would need to be also evolving in their anatomy with in its life span to continue the reproductive cycles necessary for the complete change to occur and not leave behind any remnant of the transformation process of the in the changing stages of development. For example: If flippers where once limbs of vice versa one would suspect that there would be a time in the process that the transform had both a flipper and a limb, or a wing and a limb. Why would there be no animals of any kind on the entire planet out of the millions we see the show no partial development into a continuing new species? If evolution has been going on for millions or billions of years starting with nothing and now we have millions of diverse life forms we should see an explosion of transforming creatures greater than ever before, but instead we see stability and constant reproduction which has stabilized to the degree that the evolutionary chain or tree of life that supposedly started everything has now isolated each family group into non compatible life forms with other animal groups through normal reproductive means. In other words we have evolved into separatist and have broken the biological coding. How does this supposed to further the evolutionary process?  

On the other hand if a designer had created an environment with the intent to place diversified life into the environment it seem logical the the diversified life forms would have some similarities. For example: If the atmosphere is comprised of the same composition of oxygen hydrogen etc the life forms would have to be able to live under those conditions. So lungs may be common to subsets of life forms. Bones and skeletal structures are similar based on the functionality of mobility and anatomy to hang all other parts of the anatomy onto. If the skeletal concept were not a constant then what other design would a designer use to offer the same effect for other life forms. The complexity of life forms are beyond description and the possibility that randomness brought it about is hard enough the accept. But if a designer used similar features in make as much sense as using steal in the construction of bridges as well as cars and boats trains and the millions of other things we make because it works. Why wouldn't a designer use what works and modify it to the point needed to create other lifeforms that all function in the same environment with the genius to also use that diversity to become the food chain that sustains the diversity of life. Without a simultaneously developing evolutionary food chain evolution falls apart. So what kept the first life from living?

JUST SOME REASONING",1
I'm not Christian yet I still think that the theory of evolution in the sense that we all developed from the same microscopic organisms has yet to be proved. At least whenever I question it and look for the answers all I get are a few photos of fossils and talk about bacteria morphing rather rapidly into different strains.

"Herschal Shep 

1. First of many trees have been found that way.Second trees have been founded  standing vertically in multiple soil layers that according to current scientific understanding of soil should be hundreds of years old differences and yes I agree, but that is not the issue.

2. I know we don't use carbon dating for fossils i was talking about the dating using soil layers.

3. I never claimed I hold the answer to any thing i am just showing you that archaeologists can make mistakes in the fossil record and can make it bias, because they use a lot of imagination putting bones together.

4. Lucy is anything, but a transitional species. The only thing they said makes it one was the fact in can walk upright which even if the fossil was entirely Lucy's that her  15 degrees where true it would still doesn't make an upright walker even in present day orangutan and spider monkeys have the same angle as humans yet are extremely adept tree climbers humans have an angle of about 9 degrees. Also the knee that makes this angle  was founded 200 feet lower and 1.5 miles away form where the rest of the body was founded one whole yer earlier.

P.S Your getting your sources from outdated evolutionary beliefs (I can play the source game too( See how pointless this argument is), also please don't attack me personally it makes the debate uncivilized thank you buddy. :)

P.S.S What do you believe is the strongest prove of evolution. (I am curious)",1
"Herschal Shep Welcome back I miss you.

1. Listen hard my friend when I say soil layers I am saying layers of earth that are different from one and another ( simplified ) are used by scientist to determine the age of a fossil by using the law of superposition. The trees have been founded to be in more then 3 of these layers and before you say volcano again that volcano can only explain 2 layers at most.

2. thats why fossils have been found in layers that they should not been in for that time periods they where extinct or human fossils found in coal ( just to name of few). I am saying are current understanding of how long layers of earth or formed need to be more understand.

3. I agree, I could say something about this, but it will be speculations ast that point.

4.I apologized I didn't knew that their was 2 knee bone found and the one that was found miles away isn't the one in question, also I know that it is an single individuals bones. Even if you had the bone the walking upright is still not proven and just a guess still.

5. I said stop the source game it doesn't help the debate at all. I'm curios as to what is the greatest evidence of evolution. Really we seen new species evolved from another to make a new one? evidence please. Lets play the name game now please name 10 transitional species, should be easy with millions. birds changing there beaks proves they come for dinosaurs. What is the species where talking about?

I don't care about creationism,  but evolution isn't science.

What do experiment run in a lab that shows no evidence to this like in my earlier post. Have to do with a tv show on the history channel that talks about aliens and conspiracies?( History channel was good once right or was my mind fooled into believing that it had anything to do with real history, but some of those documentaries they have are still decent.

""So... it seems we're running into a bit of a goalpost moving problem... but I'll continue to play along. And here is what I mean by that... first you demanded examples of speciation, declaring that it has NEVER been demonstrated before... I provided quite a few examples this was false... however..."" When have I ever asked for this in my post can you show me when and where, because I only asked to show experiments that proves your understandings of mutations and its relation to evolution. I never said speciations in any of my post.
""now that that post has been met you are now demanding demonstration of the jump from single to multicellular life... which is a very specific moment in evolution of life on Earth and while that is one every important event... since that moment evolution has been shaping life for hundreds of millions of years... so before we go any further I need to ask: What is this really about? You asked for speciation, you got it."" No when i said  ""Yes in theory their is no line, but not in practice for instance what would it take for a single cell organism to become multi celled? Mutation is the only answer to the question."" I'm using this as a step that can only be accomplished by mutations I wasn't asking for a demonstration at all and again show me where I asked for it in the first place?
""That takes us back some 500 million years... when life made the jump from single to multicellular. Why is that one moment so important to you? Or is it? And why does it matter? "" If the only way this can happen is with only mutations and that if mutations don't function the way you claim then multi cell organisms can't exist. Why this is important to me? How about if I say that if it was impossible then the whole theory lands flat on its face. Also we wouldn't be talking. Also liked I said I brought it up to show that evolution can only take place if mutations are like how you say they are.
""What about the other 500 million years of evolution? Would you rather talk about the origin of life? Cause I get the feeling that is what would come next once the issue of single to multicellular life is answered? (although between those two the jump from Prokariotic to Eukariotic cells is just as interesting and crucial)"" We could but it wasn't part of my plan to even talk about any of this.",1
"Herschal Shep What in the world is a mutation to you? I will tell you that it is simply a mistake or corruption in the dna. "" During the black plague, some people's bodies developed mutations that made them immune or highly resistant to it."" - Can you prove that a mutation happen to them? Is it just that some people where just immune like that bractrai experiment? Where those that weren't immune died and the surviving one produce those that were immune. this isn't a mutation for it was already part of the dna of the species. It's like say it is mutation that you are immune to colds that you already have. that isn't a mutation at all.
""there is a mutagen in people that can cause them to not produce as much myostatin as other people. Two of those people had a child. That child now has and insane amount of muscle mass and is currently able to easily lift double his own body weight.""- I never said this is impossible, but it is not a good thing either ""Myostatin is a powerful negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass in mammalian species. It plays a key role in skeletal muscle homeostasis and has now been well described since its discovery. Myostatin is capable of inducing muscle atrophy via its inhibition of myoblast proliferation, increasing ubiquitin-proteasomal activity and downregulating activity of the IGF-Akt pathway. These well-recognized effects are seen in multiple atrophy causing situations, including injury, diseases such as cachexia, disuse and space flight, demonstrating the importance of the myostatin signalling mechanism."" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22340904 
This isn't necessarily good either. That child have an decreased chance of survival which evolution depends on it to be that way. Just because it makes the child stronger doesn't make it a good thing and the mutation would probably never go anywhere. Also how does this prove that mutations can stack?
""Also, those names? Meaningless.""- All I did was show you that not all of science that agree with evolution and that I'm not just getting this for that ""one guy"" that you where talking about.
""Most of them are focused on the molecular level of biology if they are biologists at all, and you put several mathematicians in there."" -Ya so?

""Asking a mathematician to tell you that evolution is false is like asking an English major to prove string theory.""- Then should biologist be silence when they talk about math? How about Scientist should be silent when a theologian talks about theology? If that's the case then when a mathematician says that evolution is impossible do to the math? Then he should have no say, but if one make some math that agrees then you use that as evidence? Is that logical to you to silent dissent?

#########
First of all, logical impossibility does not constitute an actual possibility.
#########
I don't understand that line. Kindly explain.


########
There are plenty of things that seem illogical, for instance virtual particles which seem to not have sufficient causes and virtually ALL of Quantum Mechanics.
##########
This sort of point is oft quoted.
What is not mentioned is that we do not have a good understanding of QM. There are some witty saying something like if you think you nderstand it then you don't.
The point is this: QM is not a done deal and we may find that so-called illogicalities and impossibilities simply display our lack of full understanding.


#########
An actual infinite violates the law of Non-Contradiction, but only if you perform operations on infinity as if it is an actual number, which it is not.
#########
So if it is not an actual number then we cannot have infinite past time.
Would you agree an infinite past time is impossible?


##########
Saying that a Universe cannot come from nothing requires evidence. Can you please give me the evidence that a Universe CANNOT arise from nothing.
##########
It is simple logic.
If 'nothing' gives rise to a universe, then that state of 'nothingness' has just done something: it has given rise to a universe.
Hence it is a nothing with a property.
And a nothing with  property is not nothing.



#####
Many scientists, including Alexander Vilenkin, strongly believe that the Universe could have come into existence from nothing.
########
Quote
The picture of quantum tunneling from nothing raises another intriguing question. The tunneling process is governed by the same fundamental laws that describe the subsequent evolution of the universe. It follows that the laws should be “there” even prior to the universe itself. Does this mean that the laws are not mere descriptions of reality and can have an independent existence of their own? In the absence of space, time, and matter, what tablets could they be written upon? The laws are expressed in the form of mathematical equations. If the medium of mathematics is the mind, does this mean that mind should predate the universe?

So are you calling laws nothing?
I think Krauss did a 2 minute stint on this on YT.
He throws some lovely sleight of hand at the end to explain how the laws come into existence.
Amusing!
Search for this for some Classic Krauss Conjuring.
Lawrence Krauss: The Flavors of Nothing (YouTube Geek Week!)


#####
Some scientists would disagree with you on the ""Universe cannot have created itself"" point, but I won't try to argue it.
########
The key point you miss is that all my points are based on logic not science.
Science depends on empirical investigation. It is no guarantee of truth.
Logic underpins science.
If we can't trust logic, we then can't trust any knowledge even hard empircal facts.


##########
The simple fact that you are trying to prove a extraordinary claim based on inductive reasoning and common sense alone is just ridiculous.
##########
There is no other way to do it.
Empiricism is limited to investigation our 4D universe.
Mathematic modelling may allow us to theoretically probe beyond this.
If you discount logic, you are a sceptic and should cast doubt on all human knowledge since without logic, nothing will make sense.
The entire premise of science is that it should conform to logic.
Further, can you prove empircally that empiricism is the way to truth?
Put another way, can you give me scientific proof to show that science is the way to ultimate truth?


########
In fact, your explanation of the Universe is actually logically impossible as well. Atemporal also implies unchanging, because the ""creator"" does not exist in time,
##########
That again is a common misconception.
Not existing in our concept of time is not the same.
By necessity such an entity has to live in a diffent reality.
The exact nature of that reality is beyond our 4D minds.
There is no way a 4D entity could comprehend or grasp a 'reality' that exists 'outside' of it.
The speech marks are there because all we have is 4D based language to try to describe non-4D 'phenomena'.
To use an analogy, your question is like the Mona Lisa asking: 'Well, who painted Leonardo then and what kind of canvas is he painted on'.
Scientist do talk about concepts of 'time' of greater dimensions than our 'time'.



#######
it could not perform any actions, including create the Universe.
########
Again the same misconception - applying 4D phenomena and features on an entity which by necessity must exist 'outside' of 4D timespace.



#######
On top of that, you are applying the rule to the Universe that it CANNOT be uncaused.
########
Uncaused simply means past eternal which is explained is an impossibility since an actual infinite past time is impossible.
If you disagree I have a question I could pose to you to highlight that.


############
""The universe cannot be 'uncaused' since that either means the impossible infinite universe or a universe from 'nothing' which again is illogical.""

But then go on to say:

""This is how we arrive at an immaterial, atemporal,  uncaused entity that brought the universe into being.""
###########
There is no contradiction.
4D stuff cannot be past eternal.
The initiator to the universe by logical necessity cannot be temporal, material or subject to our 4D universe concept of cause and effect.
The word cause has many meanings and when I say this entity brings about the universe or 'causes' it, I am forced to use the language of our 4D universe.



#########
Great, now if you're willing to accept an immaterial, atemporal being as uncaused
then why not follow Occam's Razor and accept the Universe as being uncaused?
###########
I think I explained that above.
Again:
4D timespace cannot be past eternal etc.
The only logical terminator of 4D timespace is the immaterial, atemporal being.
You make the error of being rigid with words.
You need to understand that our language is bound to our 4D reality and is bound to be insufficient to explain that which exists outside of our reality.
On a side note, Occam's razor is simply a guide and not a guarantee of truth: unless you'd like to explain the proof which says it is.

##########
You're applying a set of ""impossibilities"" to the Universe, but granting them to your uncaused entity. How fallacious of you.﻿
##########
Again, see above.
The only fallacy I see is the fallacy fallacy.
By objecting to my presentation of the argument, which may not be as compelling as it could be due to my lack of ability to articulate it better or perhaps due to the fact that the language used has to straddle two different realities: our universe and the 'phenomenon' that 'gave rise' to it.

Natural selection acts independently on isolated populations.  Even if the selection pressures are the same, the mutaions will be different and once you get speciation the populations drift appart.

In the Christian view everyone is a sinner and we are only saved by God’s grace which was him sending his son to die on the cross, so no one is innocent and therefore there is justice because the murderer is the same as the person who steals(they are both sinners) even though the magnitude of their sin is different, that’s why all sinners will get hell but the level of punishment won’t be the same for all, that wouldn’t be just of God. 
God made Man perfect, it’s because of disobedience that we got this sinful nature, why do you think we’re so inclined to sin, even yourself just be honest the evil thoughts you have, lusting over the opposite sex and so on. 
And my argument for B yes .
Since thoughts rely on brain chemistry then that means everything we think is caused by a pre-existing cause and  therefore you have no free will , think about that for a second. You hold the naturalist view correct?
And about purpose, so you’re saying the purpose you think you have was just invented by yourself, I mean you’re a contingent being who wouldn’t have existed so why does your purpose that you’ve invented in your head even matter??
So you’re saying you have a PHD, since you’re so smarter that Dr Craig😂😂😂. Since you want someone in the field of Biology I’ll give you Dr Georgia Purdom and a list of 600 other PHD holders who oppose the idea of Darwinian evolution. 
You talked about bacteria, I didn’t not say the bacteria did not exist, I’m talking about the other intermediate stages of the evolution of those pre Cambrian and Cambrian fossils which I will state again are as biologically complex and the creatures we have today.
And you wanted the historians well we have; 
Josephus Flavius 
Ignatius of Antioch 
Cornelius Tacitus
Gaius Suetonius
Mara Serapion
Pliny the Younger
Clement of Rome
Those are just a few of the sources confirming the existence of Christ. 

Look bro, since you’re so smarter than the creationists views then look at their arguments with no bias towards your view.

"Thomas Bigby ""I'm sorry I had the audacity to quote the person we were talking about in a way that makes your argument fallacious.  If you can't admit when you are clearly wrong, then there is no point communicating with you."" Excuse me, but if you're too stupid to realise how scientific writing works, then there is no point communicating with you either. I took the two quotes that you put up, and then explained how that it is misrepresenting Darwin's words. In scientific writing, you are not allowed to write about things with complete certainty, that makes it unscientific. So scientists start out by saying: ""It can be said that X makes my proposition look wrong, but if you look from A-D, you can see how this is false, and my proposition is actually correct"" <--That is the format of writing that Darwin uses in both the occassions where you quote him. What you are doing is simply taking ""It can be said that X makes my proposition look wrong"" and going ""see, see, he doesn't believe in his own theory"" like some kind of idiot. It is you who is in the wrong. It is dishonesty and cowardice. And you have the audacity to pretend that I'm the one being fallacious.

""Yes, this is possible.  But this is not Mendel's work.  Mendel proved that it was normally genetic variety and not mutations that were being selected.  That is why he disproved Darwin less than a decade after Darwin published his work, and giving Mendel credit for the discovery of point mutations is disingenuous."" What?! Where did I give Mendel credit? Can you read? I was explaining to you how Mendel's work ties in with Darwin's, You clearly don't understand what you're talking about. It's probably also why you don't use specific terms, because you're just another armchair fool who thinks he's disproved evolution. Mutation is a process. Again, I will say that new genes (i.e. greater genetic variety) are the end result of the process. You yourself admit this is possible. So where is the disproving? 

""Statements like this make me wonder why I'm still replying to your babel (sic).  Like I've already said, mutations do not necessarily harm the organism, remember the examples I gave where the organism was helped by mutations.  I said you had a loss or damage of genetics.  In both examples, functions were lost or damaged, though the organism was helped."" My cited argument makes you wonder why you're still replying? Really, I actually have citations for my point, what do you have, besides ignorant rambling? There is not always a loss of information. Mutations come in many different forms, sometimes nucleotides are simply switched, there is no loss there. Sometimes, new nucleotides are inserted into the chain, there is a gain of genetic information there, sometimes nucleotides are removed, then and only then is their loss. You clearly didn't even bother to read what I linked you. All of these types of mutations are rarely fatal, nor do they all result in a ""loss or damage"" of functions, sometimes there is no difference, sometimes there is an advantage, sometimes there is a disadvantage, sometimes as you pointed out, that disadvantage gives you an advantage. <--This is why I'm specific, because speaking in layman terms will make you miss important points in what I'm saying. 

"" Selection obviously ""selects"" from genes and mutations already available.  So ""natural selection"" cannot explain ""all of it"".  You cannot select from what you do not have.  I am not against selection, I don't know why you do not hear me."" So you admit that selection selects mutations. I find it funny how you can write that and cannot see how your admission contradicts the rest of your point. Do you not understand that mutations and selection are continuous processes, that mutations will always occur, creating more genes/ or different genes, and these will be selected, if they give a fitness advantage. What don't you understand? Mendel doesn't disprove Darwin anywhere. 

""I'm only pointing out the doubt he had in his theory, as well as the bad science that I have described above. Once again, I will repeat: In scientific writing, you are not allowed to write about things with complete certainty, that makes it unscientific. Have you never taken a science class in high school or university? You cannot state your ideas with no room for error, that is why the age of the earth is given 4.54 +/- 0.05 billion years. There is no bad science here, it has been established fact for 150+ years.

Your last paragraph is just hilarious. Such delusion. It explains so much about why you simply repeat the same arguments no matter how many times I show you why you're wrong. Btw, I'm an Indian living in Australia. I've never even been to the UK, but your deluded rant at the end was fun anyway. ",1
"Thomas Bigby "" It was a minor point that I made to show that Darwinist have more confidence in Darwin than Darwin.  I'm not saying that Darwin published a debunking of his own work.  I'm mostly saying that he accepted more criticism than most Darwinists today, who believe that creationists are anti-knowledge as you believe.  You told me that Darwin said ""no such thing"".  I referenced it.  You told me I took it out of context and quoted some of the chapter on instinct, where Darwin mostly explains how this ""can"" occur.  Your reference is mostly naturalist philosophy rather than empirical science because Darwin is describing how the bees ""could have"" been evolved, which is a faith biased argument.  I personally believe he finally published his work mostly because he was angry at God for taking his favorite daughter Anne.""     We have ""confidence"" because his ideas were proven to be correct. How many times do I have to tell you how scientific writing works? I did it twice in my previous comment. You obviously didn't even bother to read it. Darwin was not accepting any criticism, he was explaining what an obvious problem would have been, and why that problem didn't exist Do I have to write that in capitals for you to understand? Taking an obvious critique of one's idea and then proceeding to debunk it is not acceptance of that critique. Well, actually there is quite a lot of empirical science, but I didn't insert it because it would quadruple how many lines my comment was. I simply gave you the excerpt of the conclusion because that is where Darwin summarises his conclusions from his empirical work (not faith based at all). Your last sentence is just irrelevant, because evolution and christianity are not diametrically opposed. And even if you think they are, then it is just the kind of typically arrogant claim a christian would make, as if any criticism must be invalid because the person criticising must have some emotional trauma. Rubbish and fuck you for saying so.

""But I don't believe that this mechanism is sufficient to create all the organisms in the biosphere."" + ""My point two paragraphs up explains what I believe mutations contribute to genetics."" You go on and on about what you ""believe"", but science is not about belief, it is simply acceptance of the facts.
As Neil DeGrasse Tyson so famously said ""The good thing about science is that it is true, whether or not you believe in it."" 
You can continue to believe whatever you want, I'm sure if we had a panel of 10 biologists to explain to you how Mendelian genetics don't disprove it, but tie in with and expand Darwin's theory, you would still continue to stubbornly believe the same ridiculous things, because you like all creationists hold an emotional attachments to your presuppositions and must dogmatically reject any new knowledge. Creationists are anti-knowledge, no matter how much they will try to deny it, because someone who is open to knowledge is willing to change their minds when the evidence points in a different direction. And no, I will not read Behe, I value my sanity too much to try and get through that book. 

""Did you know the richest man for his time ever, John D. Rockefeller, didn't graduate from high school?  Yet, he was able to start from nothing and became the wealthiest person ever.  This is why I say the internet crushes power grabbers."" What the hell are you talking about? I wasn't asking whether or not you've been educated, I was simply asking whether you were taught to make sure that your answers in science class had a measure of doubt in it. That is what makes it scientific, it leaves room for disproving later. Which is why theism is not scientific, it is completely and absolutely sure of it's conclusions, no matter how much evidence to the contrary.

""Ok, with this you're right.  Although, I would have technically been right before the Australia Act of 1986 when Australia completely severed ties with the UK (the original UK included many colonies including Australia which were part of the UK).  I still think your are brainwashed by the BBC, which is highly influenced in Australia.  That's the only reason I can find for your hatred of Christian creationism."" The BBC is highly influenced in Australia? Huh? Aside from the bad grammar, I don't have a clue why you think that, and I've lived here for more than a decade.

""His original theory wasn't completely correct.""  How would you change his theory to be more correct?

The ""it's still devolution thing"" was because I didn't refute the ""there's no gaining of cells"" thing, so sorry.""  It's not that you gain cells, but that you do not gain functional genetic information.  Yes, you can reproduce a mutation, but that gene has been permanently damaged or lost, never to return.

""The scientific process was made in the Middle Ages by Islamic ""scientists"" (they weren't called that, but basically).""  In the West, we generally consider ""science"" beginning with Aristotle.  He is the reason we study different disciplines in grade school like math and history.  He was also criticized by Plato, his discipler, for gaining his knowledge through books.  Rome absorbed much of Greek philosophy.  After the fall of Rome, Europe would speak Latin as the language of knowledge so they could read Roman literature.  At this time, Europe's science was based on theology dictated by the theocracy and popes.  Martin Luther and Galileo are major reasons the theocracy faded and was replaced once again by philosophy, which is dependent on an eternal creator of some kind.  After the Romantic Age, science became what you want it to be, naturalistic during the Empirical Age.  This is when Charles Sanders Peirce developed the naturalistic mechanism of empirical observation you call the scientific method.  During the Modern Age, Niche said that God, with philosophy, was dead.  After the atrocities that the Modern Age gave us, especially WW2, we created the Post-modern Age.  This is an age of relativism, out of all the distrust we got when we put naturalistic scientist in charge.

"Gabrielle Brock  ""That passage does not describe organic mutation. It describes genetic mutation when there was no knowledge of genetics.""  What is the difference?

""Also, philosophers don't all think that an external creator made the universe.""  They normally believe in some kind of supernatural, Plato was a Platonist.  Atheist philosophy is extremely shallow, which is why ""Nietzsche said God is dead"".

""I said the torah (which is the old testament) was less than 3500 years old because Jews came about around 3,500 years ago.""  The Torah is the law, or the first five books of the Old Testament, written by Moses.  Most of the Old Testament does not include the Torah.

""You can't have the religious book around for about 1500 years without anyone becoming a follower, especially since there was no archeology, and very little if any written language.""  This point makes no since.  The reason the Bible is successful was because it is old, even though no one could read it?

""Also, why do you assume I'm from the East? I actually live in the US.""  I didn't assume anything.  I even gave you the history of the West.

""The 'his original theory was incorrect' was quote mining, if you read anything I said, you'd know that it is changed because science adapts. Also, what he said sounds like the best description of genetic mutation there is without any knowledge of genetics.""  Evolution theory may change, but it is still wrong.  Genetic mutation is much more complicated.

""Before I go further, look up how people get down syndrome, it'll tell you that the 21st gene duplicates.

""Have you ever heard of the widely popular logical fallacy of argument from authority?""

Argument from authority is not itself a fallacy unless you cherry-pick opinions that don't fit the consensus or take their authority on a matter that isn't their specialty. Do you accept that Fermat's Last theorem is proven? If so, why?

If you think you can show the experts to be wrong, try to explain how evolution correctly predicted fossils like Archaeopteryx. How does evolution have massive predictive power while creationism have none if evolution isn't correct?",1
"Found Sheep Semantics is a branch of logic and critically important in accurate communication.  Science demands and requires a high degree of accuracy so let me help you with your confusion about the ""argument from authority"" fallacy. 

Science doesn't use ""authority"" to determine factual accuracy.  It uses evidence only.

Argument from authority being a fallacy  doesn't mean the opinion of a non-authority like you has any weight whatsoever. It simply means something isn't true just because somebody says it's true.

I am asking you why we find transitional forms between dinosaurs and birds if evolution is false. I don't care what your personal system of taxonomy is.

""Intuition is the first step of science. You cannot begin an experiment before intuition.""

And when your intuition is contradicted, you need to accept that. This is where creationists fail.

""Oh and the scientific method itself cannot be proven by the scientific method.""

The only thing in communication that is important is to be understood.  

""I did not invent this cannon of logic.  This is an appeal to authority.""

You may have a point, but logic doesn't really insure truth, it just tries to help with argumentation.  If I appeal to my pastor, or creationist scientists you would probably not be impressed.

""With religious beliefs, ""expertise"" is a rather different beast than in science, as is illustrated by the lack of consensus in religion versus science.""  

This logical fallacy is called the appeal to popularity.

""I've given you non-authority-based evidence before. Let's see how you handle it in this post.""

He surmised that in the beginning there had to be some form of matter that suddenly appeared on a quantum level. All of the mass was constricted to a very small area and eventually imploded on itself, creating what many call “the Big Bang” 

If this were the sequence of events, I find it difficult to believe that any bacterial form of life was formed at all out of the pure chaos that it’s described as.

Micro vs macro.

Macro is litterally the same process over a longer time.  Itcs like lmkwing how a clock works but saying the hour hand doesn't move because you have only watched it for a few seconds and have only seen the second hand moving.

Creation theories

Yes.  If you invent an onipotent being, then by definitionition it can ""account"" for anything.  But you haven't really accounted for anything, have you?  All you have done is pushe the problem down tbe road.  Now you need to demonstrate the existence of this being and come up with a mechanism of how this being creted life.  And i'm sorry bit simply shrugging your shoulders and saying ""magic"" or ""it just did"" doesn't cut it.  And lets face It, that's where you are right now.

Homology

Not withstanding the above, yes.  But that would point to a lazy and incompetant designer. Evolution doesn't necessarily select the best.  It gemerally selects what will do.  We see this over and over again in nature.  Evolutionary theory explains this.  Creation by and omnipotent omniscient being doesn't.

Cambrian explosion

How do you get a creation event from that?  For a start we have  stromatalites from more than a billion years previous.  We have mkre recent multicellular pre-Cambrian life and the ""explosion"" took 60-70 million years with many species being seen to evolve through this period.  And how does young earth creationism explain the dissapearence of the vast majority of these organisms?

Geographic diversity

Yes, tectonic activity plays a role.  That isn't part of a YEC model.  And it doesn't account for the pattern of pioneering orgaisms on newer islands.  If you want to punt for a ""that's just where the creator chose to put them"" or ""it's just that other animals dies oit to produce that pattern"", then fine.  But isn't it funny that the locations line up perfectly with evolutionary theory?  It's almost like the creator deliverately placed creatires in thise locations to make it look like evolution is true.

Stratification of rock

This simply isn't evidence of a flood.  For a start, sediments deposited by a single event would have a sigle graduated layer and not the mulitiple layers of wildly varying rock types we see today.  You can find locations for alternating rock types between those formed in shallow seas and on land, indicating that the are was alternatinf from being land to shallow sea as sea level varied over long periods of time.  YEC claims about laying, fossil patterns and everything else are demonstrably false.

Creation theory.

This is not difficult to understand.  That is one of it's main appeals.  It is one of the main appeals fpr religion (and let's not forget that creationism is a religious argument and not a scientific one) in general.  It plays to our psycological needs for closure fear of the unknown and need for certainty.  

 Evidence

The available evidence is the same for both sides.  That doesn't mean the evidemce is the same for both sides.  The YEC movement has a history of manipulating data, over simplifying obsevations to excluded inconvenient details and more importantly cherry picking heavily.  Look at the 'statements of faith' of the organisations providing you with creationist information.  They readily admit That they will discount and data that cannot be made to fit the creationist view as it conflicts with their presupposed conclusion that the biblical account is true.

Theories

There is only one theory.  A theory must be falsifiable and must have graduated from a hypothesis through a period of attempted falsification.  This process must include the option of the hypothesis being disgarded, not of evidemce being discarded if it conflicts with the hypothesis.

Creationism doesn't explain most of what we see in that the obsevations contradict it (design, flood etc).  It also explans nothing because it has no explanatory power.  It relies entirely on post hoc rationalisations and is unable to make any predictions, which is the hallmark of a theory.  (And I don't count  the prediction that creationsits will find something they say is evidence for their assertion, because they have already state that it is the only prediction they are willing to make and the only conclusion they are willing to draw from any evidence).

Detailed knowledge

This I find hard to believe.  I wouldn't describe my knowledge as detailed but i have a working understanding of creationists claims and even that is sufficint to see how quickly it unravels under skeptical enquiry. 

I accept that you prefer the crestonist explanation but ""better"" depends on how you define the term.  I'd happily admit that it is probably more satisfying for a lot of people, but that sais nothing about it's validity. I'll even gonsonfar as to say it's superficially more comprehensive but that is only superficial and it actually explains nothing.

And it's not about opinion.  It's about the processes that can be brought to bear on the evidence and what conclusions they allow to be drawn from th evidence.  Creationism is demonstrably fallacious in that respect.",1

All domestic dogs are a member of the species Canus lupis. Specifically, they're the subspecies of grey wolf called Canus lupis familiaris. Dingos are also the same species, just for the record, they're a member of the Canus lupis dingo subspecies and are also capable of interbreeding with domestic dogs. Indeed, dingos breed so often with feral domestic dog breeds there are very few true dingos left. Wild grey wolfs are entirely cable of breeding with members of the familiaris subspecies (assuming the parts physically fit together) but it's obviously not as common as dingos since grey wolfs are far larger and more aggressive than most domestic dog breeds. It does happen, sometimes even during the proceeds of making a new breed of dog, and that's how you get wolfdogs. I know your kind tend to live in their own little bubble but surely you know German Shepherds are a thing, right? This is not difficult information to come by. A simple squizz on Wikipedia would reveal that domestic dogs and wolfs are both the species at least and that wolfdogs exist even if you've never seen a German Shepherd before.


Basilosaurus is fully aquatic. Most cetaceans are. I never said otherwise. You're deliberately misrepresenting me. It did still have its hind legs despite being fully aquatic. Again though, they're not the only cetaceans we have and indeed modern whales and dolphins aren't even directly Basilosaurus. Additionally to the fully terrestrial Pakicetus and fully aquatic Basilosaurus we also have the semi-aquatic Ambulocetus, Kutchicetus, Artiocetus and Rodhocetus as well as other fully aquatic early cetaceans like Dorudon and many others. You're deliberately misrepresenting the volume of fossil evidence we have for the evolution of cetaceans.


Speaking of dishonesty, are we just going to ignore the lies you told earlier? You know, how you lied about our ability to create abiotic RNA and you lied about our ability to create amino acids outside the Miller-Urey experiment and how you lied about the Miller-Urey experiment and how you lied about is never observing speciation. Those lies. Are you just going to ignore the fact you got caught lying over and over and over again in favour of changing the subject so you can spout new lies about dogs and whale evolution? You understand that if you have to lie and misrepresent science in order to make your point you don't have a point, right? Because you haven't stopped repeating the same lie you've been corrected on:
""No species ever exceeds its genetic boundary’s and no new genetic information is added to or taken away from a species""
You know this is wrong. You know duplication and addition mutations exist. You know mobile genetic elements exist. You know horizontal gene transfer exists. You know endogenous retroviruses exist. You know all of this because I've explained all this to you myself. Repeating the same lie over and over again doesn't magically change reality.


Also this idiocy:
""...in the fossil records and the only changes seen is genomic variations within species""

" K a protein is made generally made of more than 200 amino acids, which means a genetic code that is just as long. Changing to a similar protein might only require, ...10 to 25 changes in the code to change to a similar protein (this would be easier than say creating a protein genetic code completely from scratch, which would require 200+ mutations in a specific order). 

The problem I am discussing is that even an easier problem, such as changing a protein genetic code to a similar protein code is even too much, since the duplication process in reproduction is very precise. There are a staggeringly small number of mutations, in a vast code that occur per generation. This small number of mutations within the vast code cannot even produce enough of the precise changes needed to change a protein to another protein. 

Since proteins are just the building blocks, and that is too difficult to account for using ""evolution"" by random mutation, it stands to reason it would be an even greater difficulty accounting for the array of proteins and detailed information necessary for the production of novel features that exist in a sea mammal versus a land mammal.

What is the moral code of atheism? Most religions list their sins somehow, atheists do not. Laws are influenced by the religious as well as the non-religious so thst really isnt an absolute moral code laid out for and by atheists. Ergo, not a moral code of atheism.

Evolution isn't taken at faith. It is the most plausible theory based in the currently available evidence. Even the scientists who accept it are constantly trying to test it (which many faiths condemn; ""thou shalt not tempt the Lord""). 

As for congregations, atheists dont go to school to discuss atheism and debate the non-existence of God. They study all grades of things, and in college religion is even one of them. How many religious texts encourage the reading of other religious texts of a different faith? And i was never taught by any instructor in all my years of grade school nor college that God does not exist. Thats hardly a congregation of any kind of religion, but a congretation of scholars seeking knowledge that is most often completely unrelated to any religion.

It is also not asserted by an authority and is only required by virtue of the definition.  The individual is free to believe in a god (nothing about atheism states you can't change your mind) but you would no longer be an atheist by definition.  Compare that to religion, where apostasy is punishable by death and eternal torture.

Unifying moral code
Atheism has no moral code.  Many are humanists of some description but that isn't required.  Theists usually take great delight in claiming that you can't have a moral code without god and pointing out the actions of atheist dictators who clearly didn't accept the previous societal norms in their respective nations.  One of the main points of atheims is that it removes the moral dictates of religion and frees you up to find a better moral system.  What that is is entirely up to the individual.

Scriptures to be taken at faith.
Firstly, evolution isn't a scripture.  You would need to list the books. But what about not believing in god means it is compulsary to accept evolution (which is observed)?  There are many atheists that don't accept evolution just as there are many theists who do.

Congregations

You do realise that all of the places you listed (in the us at least) will be majority theist, right? You are also commiting another equivication fallacy. People do not go to education establishments to ""practice atheism"".  Think about what you are saying.  A school is a place where people gather with the expressed purpose of not believing in god together. Ridiculous. Can you do religious studies in these institutions? Maybe you should have restrictrd it to science class.  You can't have god there.  But god isn't scientific.  You can't have ghosts or bigfoot or palm reading or astrology or witchcraft or homeopathy either.  And even in a science class, how much time is spent talking about the non existence of god?  That's right.  None.  Because religion isn't allowed in the science classroom.

"Firstly, what your teacher is doing is illegal.

Secondly, it is not about 'point of view' it is about what the evidence shows.

There is no ""both sides"".  This is not a debate within science.  The choice is between what science tells us (that the evidence overwhelmingly supports evolution) and the irrational belief that an anonymous book from a superstitious and scientifically illiterate ironage culture is accurate in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  Genesis isn't even the original origin myth in the bible.  The original myth from the polytheistic cannanite religion (from which the monotheistic Hebrew religion evolved) is referred to in several other places in older books of the Bible.

Out of interest, what does your teacher tell you?  Does she give you the impression that the evidence for each is balanced?  Maybe you could give an example of what she gives as evidence for creationism?",1
"​   Hi again Sarah, I'm going to sound like I disagree with everything you said, but I want to make it clear that I don't think it's because you're less intelligent because I don't have any reason to believe that. One's knowledge and one's intelligence are two vastly different things. 

1) Evolution doesn't go against the Big Bang. Earths evolution started about 3.5 billion years ago, and The Big Bang was about 14 billion years ago and what that was is the creation of matter. It took 380,000 years after the big bang for electrons to be trapped in orbits around nuclei, forming the first atoms. These were mainly helium and hydrogen, which are still by far the most abundant elements in the universe. 1.6 million years later, gravity began to form stars and galaxies from clouds of gas.and all this has almost nothing to do with evolution other than it created the first atoms, and we are made up of atoms.  Science could never recreate the Big Bang, what I think you're referring to is the Hadron Collider. Scientists are looking for what existed fractions of a second after the Big Bang.

2) Abiogenesis is the study of how life came from lifelessness. Science is still working on this, but abiogenesis is a separate field of science from evolution. How life arose is still a mystery, but once life occurs, evolution takes over, and science has physical evidence that the first life to exist were prokaryotic cells, and from that we see new forms of life emerging over long periods of time. Science doesn't know how life started, but it does understand how it evolved once life took hold, and all the physical evidence points to evolution. 

3) You said, ""creation does answer some of the questions that science still can't explain."" My response to that is without evidence or any explanatory power, what creationism does is assert it knows the answer.  All creationism does is say since science can't explain this, the answer must be God. It isn't anti-Christian to learn how things came to be. Science is the best way for us to gather knowledge and advance our understanding of the physical world.

4) ""I can't believe we are here by chance."" Anything here by chance might say the same thing. What are the odds that I'm here by chance?  The fact is that we are all here by chance, even if a God created everything. The chance your father and mother would meet, or that your four grandparents would meet, on and on back through time. For you to exist means every ancestor before you had to mate with just the right person or you, Sarah, would have never existed.",1

I realize evolution deniers can be exhausting, but that was the first discovery that made us realize we may not have been the direct product of a supernatural being that cares about our every thought and need.


Now between an individual who cannot accept the prospect of their own nonexistence and one that is indifferent to it, which has a better survival instinct? Obvious answer and the one that has more reproductive success is equally obvious.


Take it this way, if one accepts that they are a highly evolved ape that may know nothing more after its demise with indifference, evolution has failed you quite utterly.

So from this vid, it is saying evolution is a good way to go (science is not about Truth) because: 1) similarities in species; 2) features not in its best efficiency; and 3) observable evolution. Other than that, he just keeps repeating evolution is correct many times. If I missed something, please point it out (I don't pretend to be a biology expert, never).

For 3, no one can contend mutation and horizontal variation, like breeds of dogs and cats, and antibiotic resistance. It's observable, so fine.

But for vertical transformation, 1 and 2 is not convincing, if those are the only arguments that proves present-day animals came from common ancestors. It can be argued also that efficiency was not the goal, but something else that we still don't grasp. Similarities can also be argued as signatures, like a painter or programmer where patterns in their individual works can be found, as a sign that they made it and not others. Also, pandas, as I know, are carnivorous anatomically, even now that they devour bamboos. The gut bacteria is the same. Did the blue-green algae from million years ago changed?

Unless macroevolution becomes observable (like with a time machine), it is not convincing to think that some set of conditions will make animals evolve. A lion (or lions) trapped on some island might be able to catch a fish, until fishes go farther, lions starve, cannibalize and die. Easier to think than them developing fins to swim.

"You can call it microevolution if you want to, but there is nothing new or of higher complexity that evolved -- it's simple adaptation.

"Even if you had never seen a person walk 1 mile, do you still agree that if you walk for a specific amount of time, you'll have walked 1 mile?
And even if you cannot personally watch a person walk 1 mile (for whatever reason), do you agree that a mile long foot prints is evidence that someone did walk a mile? 

You can observe the macro-perspective of evolution in the fossil record, in genetics, in embryology, and in the geographic distrubition of species, for example. All of these areas agree quite specifically on the evolutionary history of life on Earth, and followed the predictions of the theory of eovolution and the theory of unviersal common ancestry. 
This cannot be a coincidence, and no one would argue against such evidence if it wasn't a question that was in opposition to religious beliefs. What I means is that the evidence for the common ancestry of all Earth life is stronger than the evidence for the existence of atoms, and stronger than our evidence for how gravity works, and so on. Yet no one argues against those things, because there is no ""holy book"" that stands in contradiction to it.

""Also, why do you say ""change over time""? Isn't all change ""over time""?""

Yes, we can talk about the evolution of hair styles, or the evolution of a city. In the most general sense, ""evolution"" only means ""change over time"", often ""from simple to more sophisticated"".
However, in the context of ""the theory of evolution by natural selection"", which is a theory in the field of population genetics and biology (and the unifying theory of biology!), ""evolution"" specifically means ""the change in allele frequencies in a population over time"", nothing else!
So whenever we scientifically talk about the evolution of life (and some non-life, aswell), this is the exact definition we're talking about, not just ""change over time"".",1
"So. aHd, evolution means ""the change in allele frequencies in a population,"" .. or is this incorrect without the phrase ""over time.""

Why does this definition include the phrase ""over time""? Isn't all change ""over time""?  Does ""over time"" add anything? If so, what?

How exactly do fossils show this? Do you think fossils are are a record of demographic changes / changes in alleles?

How exactly does embryology show change in allele frequency? ... geographic distribution of species? ... any other ""macro"" evidence you claim?

Taking a hike does not claim changes in the descendants of a person making the hike; it claims transportation took place, not change in allele frequencies or the like. :)",1

If you weren't scientifically illiterate you would know that the a intific method doesn't prove things right, it only proves them wrong.

Creationism has no reliable evidence.  It has claims.  It has things it claims to be evidence but it doesn't present a legitimate scientific case for the evidence.

Evolution has 150years minimum of scientific research.  Thousands of peer reviewed papers in subjects from paleontology to genetics.

Stanford is a member of an organisation that admits it has a presuposition that theistic accounts of creation must necessarily be true and he does not accept the suppoting evidence from other scientific field such as those that the earth to be 4.5bn yrs old. 

Paul Nelson

His qualifications are in philosophy of biology, not biology.  He is another member of the discovery institute and therefore admits bias, presuposition and an anti-scientific agenda.  He was a witness in support of ID at Kitzmiller vs Dover and got trashed because he has nothing to back up his claims.  He was even quoted as saying ""Easily, the biggest challenge facing the I.D. community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don't have such a theory right now, and that's a real problem. Without a theory, it's very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions and a handful of notions, such as irreducible complexity, but as yet, no general theory of biological design"" despite the discovery institute lobbying hard to get ID into schools on the basis that it was a valid scientifc argument to rival evolution through natural selection.
Like all the others at the DI, he is effectively just a proven liar.

"I did not believe in God
I hated his ways.
But God changed me!
I was addicted to alcohol, obscene, to pornography. This world today is full of adultery. Children hate parents, the younger generation no longer follows God.
But do you know that God still loves us?
Two years ago, I was so depressed. After the New Year's party, I got tired of this world. Then God came to me.
God showed me that he was real.
When we're all not even thinking about him, he's still waiting.
I cried so much that I cry even now. This generation is really rejecting God. And there is a judgment coming. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on Jesus the iniquity of us all. 
Do you know that hell is real? God made us in his image but we use our functions to hate things, steal, lie, gossip! That's why we don't know God. But he is so near that if you seek him, you will find him just as he promised!


The love of God cannot measure with ours. He gave us all. He sent his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sin. And Jesus rose again! So you who are reading can be saved and become children of God! Jesus is the only way to be saved. Repent and believe him. God is giving us today to repent and return to him. He sent his son so we can live. We can be forgiven and begin everything clean through Jesus. We can even become a new creation and live with Jesus forever.


 Ask God to forgive you and reveal yourself. I know he will because I know he is real and he is with me. Heaven rejoices when a sinner returns to him. After giving my life completely to Jesus, all my addictions disappeared and I am living a new life. Now this world is nothing to me. Money, success, popularity ... are just lies that the devil uses to make our mind lose consciousness and turn against God. God can take care of that if you seek his kingdom. That's not important. This is not religion. It's all about Jesus. It is if you know God and love him. That's very true. Jesus will come soon and everything that rebels against him will be judged. He still loves you.

"   ""key word ""theory"" A scientific theory such as evolution is quite different than what is meant by the more common usage of that word. In everyday terms, a theory is essentially a guess. In scientific terms, a theory is an explanation for an observed phenomenon. For instance, the law of universal gravitation states that bodies of matter will be attracted to each other with a force inversely proportional to the distance between them. This is the mathematical rule of what will happen. The theory of gravity, on the other hand, is the explanation for this rule. It is just about as close to certainty as we could possibly get. The theory of evolution is an explanation for evolutionary change, which we know happens.


""well then how can plants there be plants and humans very different."" I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that.

"Think of it this way:

When a magician (or a sourcerer, or whatever) does something beyond our capability to understand, we usually call it magic. When Jesus does it, we should call it something else?

Now the fundamental difference between magic tricks performed by contemporary magicians and magic tricks performed by Jesus is this:

We actually have examples of real magicians performing real magic tricks. You can go see them do their stuff for yourself. No such evidence exists for Jesus multiplying loafs of bread or raising the dead.

And in any case, none of this is relevant to the topic of the video - which is the well-supported explanatory framework of biology.",1
"Modern magic is tricks. It is explainable.

It's explainable as tricks only because we know it is. If a magician gets his tricks right, he's the only one who's able to tell how he did it, and there's no way for the audience to determine that he did not really saw that woman in half and then supernaturally put her back together again.

Imagine that the phenomenon is new, that noone's ever heard of people earning money by performing tricks on stage before, and that you hear, by way of rumour, of some guy travelling through the States, visiting cities, publicly sawing people in half and then healing them again.

So that's basically the definition of magic: the unexplainable. If we can't explain how something's done, we say it's magic.

Is there anything that distinguishes Jesus-magic from any other kind of magic or sorcery - other than the identity of the people performing it?

I think I'd like evidence supporting the statement that such magic was performed to begin with. All I have now is the Gospels, and that just tells me what the mostly anonymous authors who wrote them may have believed.

"Wait, how can it be ""yes"" for humans and ""no"" for everyone else?",1
"   

Yes.  One of the fundimental properties underlying the scientific method is that the prosess removes opinion and relies on objectivity.  It doesn't always work perfectly but it isnl a sound epistomology.

Remember that many of the people teaching in secular institutions do hold a personal religious belief.  Look at Ken Miller.  He is a devout catholic but was still the lead witness against ID at the Dover trial bevause he is intellectually honest when it comes to evaluating the evidence.  This is because, likenany true scientist, he doesn't put faith above evidence ans reason.

Think carefully about what you have said.  I'll grant you that if you boil it right down there is a belief at the bottom of this, but it is the belief that science should be based on evidence and reason and the application of the scientidic method.  It is the application of the null hypothisis to all claims and the refusal to grant a special exception to religious belief.  

Yes, science excludes the supernatural.  By definition.  But this is because it excludes ALL things for which there is insufficient evidence to conclude existence.  It is that same for attributing anything to faries,  magic elves and (somethign you have probably forgatton you exclude too) everyone else's gods.

Remember that we have a word fornsupernatural things that we can demonstrate exist and have a material effect on the universe.  We call the ""natural"".

The refusal to make a special exception for a faith based belief is not a bias.  It is the absence of one.  If evidence was there for the existence of a god, wouldn't science recognise it?  It is simply that ""God"" would become ""natural"".

I'm sure your Dad would say science is ""in truthful"", but that is a bit disengenuous. Science doesn't claim ""truth"".  It claims to give the best possible explanation given the available evidence. All conclusions are provisional and subject to revision pending additional evidence.  I'm also guessing that he is defining ""truth"" as what is claimed in the bible (given that his employers require it).  So using that as a metric, anything apart forn the bible becomes ""untrue"" by definition.  

But this is where we come back to epistomology.  Do you think that arbitrarily presupposing that an anonymous ironage book is making  ""true"" claims about the nature of the universe is a sound way to get to an accurate picture of how the universe actually works?

Do you think that is more or less likely to suffer from self serving bias, cherry picking, counting the hits and ignoring the misses etc etc...  All the things that we accept in everyday life don't give you reliable answers?   If you were sick and needed treatment, would you rely on prayer or get medical treatment?  I know there are many anecdotal claims that prayer can heal but studies have shown the complete opposite.

You see, science relies on data.  If you can't show it, you don't know it.  And I know that your dad is trying to show it using data, but don't you agree that if you are willing to be selective with your data (something the scientific community does not tolerate) and you have a presupoosed conclusion (something else the scientific method doesn't allow) you can ""prove"" pretty much anything you like?",1
"   

Reading the other conversation, you are trying to create a fase dichotomy.  It's a fallacious argument.  You are trying to draw lines where none exist.  Step back a little.  Imagine you lined up all animals in order of their cognative ability.  On what basis do you draw a line between humans and the orher animals?  You need a justification for that line that shows that something else is going on.  

So how do you do that?  What is your justification?  Why isn't the line somwwhere else?",1
"   

Do you mean why are we different to the other apes?  We aren't.  We have no evidence that our brains are performing any function that theirs aren't.  The difference is that we have evolved complex language in order to communicate these concepts.

Think for a moment.  What is an ""intellectual opinion""?  It's just formulating a response to a peceived problem or set of external conditions, right?  Apes can do that.

And consider this.  Can a baby have an intellectual opinion?  Are they less of a human until they have developed enough to have one?  If an adult chimp is better able to rationalise abstract concepts than a human baby are they more human?

Fine, adult humans have an intellectual capacity that can exceed chimps, but you are cherrypicking the variable.  Chimps are significantly stronger than us.  Why didn't you select strength over intellect?  Is it just because intellect is the one you are better at?

Sorry if you feel insulted.  That is not the intention.  But we will challenge you.

The difference between us seems to be that we have a higher threshold of evidence, we are more comfortable with not having a solution and we have less incredulity as a result.

Lets take it back a step. 

You think humans are special.  Why?  We are unique in some small ways (that admittedly have big consequences) but unique is not special.

We take the evidence for evolution on it's own merrits.  And the evidence is overwhelming.  I know it's hard, but try to imagine taking your religion off the table.  Do you think that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that humans an chimps share a common ancestor, for example.  The genetic evidence alone is pretty much conclusive and you add to that the fossil record amd homology.  

Ok.  Now lets see if god should get back on the table as a competing hypothesis.  What evidence do we have that a god exists?  What evidence do we have that a god, assuming it exists, created humans as they are today? 

If we want to propose that hypothisis we need tonsee empirical evidence and there needs to be a viable mechanism proposed.

""I read it in a book"", and ""by magic"" don't cut it I'm afraid.

This comes back to the epistomology.  The reason we don't allow the god hypothesis on the table is because it is completely devoid of empirical evidence and because the arguments for it's existence are demonstrably fallacious.  If you have something worth considering, then we'll listen, but the first hurdle  you need tonover come is the demonstration that you have an epistomologically sound basis for putting forward a claim on the first place, and as far as we can see, you don't.",1
"   Are you sure? Don't apes have complex behavioral and social structures? Don't they have a language of their own? Language alone doesn't make a species intelligent. The ability to communicate is not unique. 
So why did evolution pick us at random to be unique? 

I'm also sorry to back track here, but do you know that evolution closely linked to the philosophy of naturalism?",1
"   

No, but language needs to attain a certain level of refinement in order to communicate abstract concepts, which is what I assume you men by intellectualism?  We also need to be able to understand the language to be able to say what they are trying to communicate.  Chimps have been observed interacting with thunderstorms, usually in an agressive way.  Who is to say their attempt to communicate with a thunderstorm isn't, in their minds, them communicating with what they take to be a ""God"" of some sort?

Almost all animals are unique in some way.  Evolution didn't pick us.  For a start you are assuming intent and you have no demonstration of that.  You are again cherrypicking the criteria and putting an undue weight on human traits just because you are a human.  If there comes a time when humans are extinct, how unique will we be then?  If the goal of evoluton is to continue the survival of a group of organisms, why aren't bacteria and archaea the unique ones for managing to survive with the least amount of evolutionary change?  

Try to get a handle on the weak antropic principle and to not have such a humancentric point of view.  Be a little more objective.

Backtracking is fine if that's what you want to do.

What do mean by linked?  And are you talking about ontological naturalism or mythological naturalism?

Fine, evolution is ""consistent"" with a naturalistic philosophy, but so what?  It's true to say that it is falalcious to argument that the fact that the natural world is all we can observe  so that is all that CAN exist, but science is based on mythological naturalism, not ontological naturalism.  

It is common for apologist to conflait the two which is why they use the umbrella term ""naturalism"" rather than using the specific version.  It is basically using an equivocation to create a strawman.

So yes, evolution, like all sciences, is ""linked"" to methodological naturalism.  What's your point?  Both are simply the application of the null hypothesis in the face of inadequate evidence to demonstrate the hypothesis with respect to the claim that things beyond the natural exist.

This comes back to something i think i said earlier. That we have a word for supernatural things that we have demonstrate to be real.  And that word is ""natural"".

Does that help?",1
"Okay. I agree that our bodies are really no different than apes'. So, here's the thing. If our DNA, brains, and bodies are so similar to an apes', why are we different? why are we having this conversation right now? Even though apes have communications, we have no evidence that they have intellectual opinions, theology, or philosophy. And although evolution may be able to evolve a material body, it has no sway over nonmaterial ideas and existence. 

Which brings me to my second question. You, Nicholas, have said that theism causes people to fly planes into buildings and become pedophiles and LGBT haters. Have you ever read the Bible? Have you ever seen anything in the Bible or Quran (but particularly the New Testament of the Bible) that tells people to abuse children, kill people and hate people? 

Evolution is linked to naturalism, and the implications for us as humans is that we're purely animals and don't matter. Do you believe you're a ""special"" animal with no respect or connection with anything intangible? 

I'm sorry to be so humanistic, but it's what I'd like to ask about. Your worldview, as demonstrated by my dad, determines the way you view science, not the other way around.",1
"All right, here's the tea. The nonmaterial is ingrained in every aspect of our existence. We have a concept of numbers. They're real, but we can't see them. We have a concept of life. Life is real, but can you touch it or see it? What about stories? Stories are huge parts of life, but can you weigh them or touch them? 

Your point on numbers is extremely valid. How do you explain the existence of numbers, stories and things we can't see? Did they evolve into life? Are they a product of our brains? 

And if they are a product of our brains, why don't we have evidence that animals have these concepts? They have brains just like us. 

And I'm asking why. Well, isn't there a why? If there wasn't a why, why would I have the concept of why?",1

So the two finches produced non finches?,1
"What is FACT is that living organisms change to live in certain circumstances. They do adapt to fit their environment, but what isn't a FACT is that they adapt into different species. 

Some reasons to disbelieve evolution are this:
1. The human body is far more complex than ANY man made thing, even computers. Looking at a computer, you'll see that there is no possible was they it could have came about on its own. If we are more complex than that, it seems rather unlikely that we came about on our own. 

2. Complexity, like computers, or really anything, like paintings, houses, and calculators all came into existance as a result of a mind. Some intelligent thing put it together because complexity doesn't arise naturally. The believe that humans, and all life has no intelligent creator, seems close to impossible. 

3. Things get worse over time unless some outside thing pushes it along for the better. You can imagine this as a house left alone for years. It will begin falling apart, collecting dirt and probably begin to host many bugs, etc. If some people live in the house, they can keep the house in good condition. This in science is known as entropy; disorder increased as time moves forward. Evolution clearly states otherwise. 

4. DNA does not tend towards growth over time but that's what the evolution theory would suggest, unless the first cell already had billions of base pairs in its DNA. 

5. Some life forms, like humans and the bacteria in our gut, need each other to live. If that bacteria went away, we would be dead. If we went away, the bacteria would be dead. Which evolved first? 

6. The first cell impossibly came together from nothing and was functional. This cannot have happened logically. It even goes against cell theory which is in biology.",1

"Ricahrd P'Brien I am unaware of any observed speciation, could you share with me the example you are referring to?",1
"Hm Grraarrpffrzz 

0. I have not seen that statistic anywhere, and in fact most people that I've meet do not believe in evolution, because they know of its absurd implications. 
1. The point here (that you missed) is that complexity at the level of a human body, must not have come about on its own. Using less complex examples like computers, we see that even they cannot come about on their own. 
2. Humans building computers, or beavers building dams, is evidence against evolution. Is shows that minds create complexity, not natural processes.
3. The house was simply a relatable example. The point was (the second law of thermodynamics) that disorder increases over time. 
4. I am in a biology class at the moment specifically on evolution. I know that DNA is CAPABLE of growing, but again the point (that you missed) is that it does not TEND towards growth. You will probably not have much more DNA then your great grandfather. If evolution were true, extra base pairs would be required for every generation, and this is not what we see happens. 
5. Humans cannot live with this bacteria, this bacteria cannot live with humans. Which one evolved first? Whatever answer you give, evolution would not work.

"Hm Grraarrpffrzz 

My point is that life is impossible without an intelligent designer. This has nothing to do with a ""deity"". However I do believe that God exist and made life, so I will answer your questions to best of my abilities: 


How did God do it? 

I do not know. If I knew, I would be God, and perhaps try it out a few times. 

What does God consist of? 

God is the creator of matter, so He is immaterial. He doesn't consist of anything like that. I'm not sure what you mean by consist of, but I do know that God is: spaceless, timeless, eternal, immaterial, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, loving, just, and good. If you want a better answer, maybe rephrase the question. 

Who created God? 

God did not begin to exist. He is eternal. When something begins to exist, like the universe, or life, something caused it to exist, or created it. But if life always existed, it does not need a creator. However life and the universe did begin to exist, but God did not. He always exists. 

Where is God? 

Everywhere. He is omnipresent. 

Can you prove that God exists?

Yes, beyond a reasonable doubt.",1
"I think you are wrong. You think life is impossible without an intelligent designer because you do not possess the knowledge to explain would be possible without a designer. Your argument for an intelligent designer is not knowledge that supports such a designers existence, but a lack of knowledge of yours. You state ""I don't know how XYZ is possible without an intelligent designer"", but all this proves is that you lack knowledge. That's it.

You're like a guy who 2000 years ago looked up, saw a lightning flash in the sky, and who said ""This is the work of mighty Zeus, the thundergod! Who else could cause this!"".

You are exactly like that guy. He had no actual argument that supports the existence of mighty Zeus. His argument was merely the lack of knowledge. ""I don't know how such lightning can happen, so it must be God!"", he said. ""I don't know how life can happen, so it must be God!"", you say. In both cases, you consider your lack of knowledge as evidence. He was wrong, and you are wrong.

Can God think? How can he do that if he has no brain (is immaterial)? And if your God is timless and omniscient, then that means that we have no free will either. Nothing that you do matters, as you have no choice on anything, if what you say would be true. 

And how does this ""God always existed"" thing works? I mean, you said that the universe didn't exist at some point, right? And then Your God decided to create it. What did he do in the five minutes before that? In the 1000 years before that? If he always existed, then there was an infinite of time before the creation of the universe that your God existed, and when that infinite amount of time passed, he said ""ok, let's do this"", and he created the universe. But how can an infinite amount of time pass? After all, it's infinite.

You say you can prove that God exists. Please do. I've never even heard a rational argument supporting the existence of one or more deities, witnessing a proof would be enlightening.",1

Things can be true without any evidence, but accepting things knowing there’s no evidence and rationalizing it because it seems reasonable is a great way to be wrong.

"My question is how did the very first animal reach adulthood? A day old baby with no one to feed it will die pretty quickly. Then the fact that there are male and female to reproduce is suspicious. That is a pretty great coincidence because you need to reproduce in order to evolve. Seems designed. Look at the rotation and orbit of the sun and moon and earth, you think that's random coincidence? We've built space ships to go to the moon. We've produced Beethovens 5th symphony and Mona Lisa and invented the vehicle etc. We've invented medicine and surgery and vast economies. We track history and record time. No other species know what a week or a month is. We do things that no other animal in history has ever come close to doing. We're the most sophisticated species ever by far. I also think it's very coincidental that evolutionary theory is always so progressive. To go from any other type of animal that all just basically spend their day eating and going to the bathroom and sleeping to progressively evolving a human that can perform brain surgery and invent etc is a stretch. Where does this progression come from? What gives these species the ability to progressively evolve?",1

"Soooooooo my question is, where is the observable proof that a species can evolve into a whole new species? All I've really heard from this guy is talk about micro-evolving to survive threats, that makes sense and is clearly observable but you showed no actual proof of a species evolving into another species. That's the problem you cant observe it because apparently it takes too long to observe. So you expect us to take it on faith that your ""theory"" is correct and the people that don't blindly agree with what you say are just people that ""don't understand."" Sounds a lot like every other person that started a religion in history if you ask me. The fossil records do not prove anything. Sorry if i'm offending you and your beliefs, i just cant have faith in an idea. I have faith in every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God because i can observe it with a spiritual understanding and have my faith strengthened by the works he performs in my life every day. His voice is clear and yours is not. 
Also what about all the scientists that are now claiming all life on earth showed up at around the same time? Again, if you ask me the fossil records prove there was a creator. Yes we may have similar genes to other species because that's the template God used to create his perfect creation.

Evolution is a slow and gradual process, the change from one generation is very slight. The problems you list here, like the baby animal, did never exist as animals slowly evolved from other forms of life. 
Genders isn't suspicious at all either. If you had spent 10 sec at Google you would have found multiple sources explaining this. To be short, life can reproduce without genders to start with.

at some point these two groups will be quite different from each other because they didnt exchange genetic material and maybe one group has a chromosome less or some chromosomes are a littie bit different whatever...they wont be able to reproduce anymore. And thats where we humans give them different names or call them different species.
This has been demonstrated many times even in the laboratory with bacteria or flies but it can also be seen with elephants for example the asian elephant cant reproduce with the african elephant even though they look very similar but they just lived for too long isolated from each other...

"Here's why we really have tail bone folks. The “tail bone” is the small triangular bone at the lower end of your back bone or vertebral column. Early anatomists thought it was shaped “like a cuckoo’s beak” they gave it the name coccyx (from the Latin for Cuckoo). They didn’t call it a tail because it doesn’t look like one.
It’s nickname of “tail bone” came from Darwin and his followers who believed it was the useless or vestigial remains of a tail, left over from monkey-like evolutionary ancestors. However, this bone is no more useless than any other bone in the body. So what does it do?
One of our editors found the answer the hard way when he tore the ligaments attached to his’ tail bone’ whilst doing sports training. He writes about the experience: “ I knew something was badly wrong when I could only walk by shuffling each leg forward using my upper body strength. If I was standing up, that’s where I preferred to stay. It was too painful to try and sit down. If I was sitting down, I didn’t want to get up – shifting position was exquisite agony.”
Medical research has shown that the muscles which help us sit or stand, all gain their ability to move us only because they are attached to our fully functional and necessary so called ‘tail bone’ which of course means that human beings do not actually have a useless or even vestigial “tail bone”! The coccyx is fully functional part of the system of bones, ligaments and muscles of the pelvis, that protects and supports the pelvic organs, and contributes to our upright stance and walking. It provides stable anchorage points for ligaments and muscles which is an essential function of all bones. Without this – we don’t move. Bones must never be considered in isolation, since they are part of an integrated musculoskeletal system that supports and protects body organs, and enables us to move.
The claim that the tail bone or coccyx is useless, and therefore must be evidence for evolution, as well as evidence against creation, (because no intelligent Creator would make useless organs) is claim made out of ignorance. The human musculo-skeletal system shows all the evidence of brilliant creation. Consider how much clever engineering has already gone into attempts to make a robot that can walk like a human. When robot scientists do manage this it will be because of intelligent, creative design and engineering, not because of chance random processes.",1

There is no difference between 'micro' and 'macro'.  They are the same process, just over a longer time.

There are also obnservations that support the theory, not least tbe genetics. Mitochondria DNA is the remains of bacteria absorbed by early cells and providesba tracable record of inheritance.  We can observe the similarities in DNA, including the observation that human chromosome 2 is a fused pair of chimp chromosomes.

We can observe the remnants of rear legs in whales and we can observe the decline of those rear legs with successive fossil whales through time. 

I'm sorry but the whole 'macro/ micro' and 'obsevational science' thing is a complete ruse invented by the creationist movement to try to remove the evidence ence that proves them wrong from the discussion.  It is competely fallacious and has no scientific basis.

The cambrian explosion raises a few questions but it isn't a problem for evolutionary theory.  Again that's just the creationist movement making an unsupported assertion.  It ignores the pre cambrian and that the cambrian explosion took 70-80 million years.  That long ago we were still mice like creatures hiding from t-rex.

We can observe the evidence for the time required too, whether it's radiometric dating (something else the creationist movement has tried hard to discredit, including a lot of outright frauds) or sodium red shift. 

So yes, we can observe evidence of 'macro' evolution.

You asked me why I believe in evolution.

Firstly, i don't believe in evolution.  I accept that the theory of evolution by natural selection provides the best explanation of the observed facts and the predictions of the theory have been consistantly ratified and not once falsified for 150yrs.

The evidence is accumualted of years of education and are too numerous to mention but i'll give you some highlights.  You should also note that it is an understanding of the scientific method that gives confidence in other conclusions drawn by others where it can be demonstrated that this method has been used.  This is because the scientific method is the single most reliable method we have for determining the truth about the universe.  It gives us all the technology we enjoy to today.

Evidences for evolution.
1) The fossil record as supported by geology, comparative biology and atomic physics.
2) Embriology.  The early formation of limb buds, the fact that chicken embryos begin to grow a 13 vertibra tail before it is reabsorbed. 
3) Biogeography, especially where you have archipelagos that formed recently. 
4) Genetics.  Mitochondrial DNA records and the orgins of the mitochondria. Chromosome no.2 in humans.

There is much more that i can write here, but that sould get you started.

There is also the fact that every attempt i have seen by creationists to debunk evolution has proven fallacious or outright dishonest.

strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.

Not only is that an equivication fallacy, but he then tries to use an arguement from personal incredulity about cosmology to argue a non-sequitur.

He then produces more incredulity about cosmology needing somethg to be eternal, which is exactly what he is proposing, except the thing he is proposing is potentially far more complex that the thing cosmologists are proposing.

Then more incredulity about ""living from non-living"". What really is the difference between organic non-living chemisty and simple life? The God hypothesis, on the other hand has fully formed complex organisms from thought?  And humans from non-living dirt through a gollum spell.  His own hypothisis suffers from the very things he is accusing evolution of, but even worse.

Then we get the ""i've never seen a human have a non human"". If that happened it would disprove evolution. Has he ever seen a god make a human?

"Ricahrd P'Brien,
Anything I say you will reject because you deny a creator. What you see as absolute fact is only a possibility. You could look at a Whale and see an inefficient design, yet I see beauty as I watch a giant mother humpback whale push her newborn to the surface to take its first breath. You will not have liked that answer. Our God Created a diverse world and did this instantly. How could a bombardier beetle have developed its spray of toxins instantly? This is an extremely complex system which if only one part does not work perfectly the creature would die. How can a giraffe drink water? If any number of structures within the giraffe did not work the giraffe would not be able to drink. Where you see inefficiency, I see evidence of a design because the complex structures could not have arisen slow or else the creature would be dead. We have probably no idea what any number of so called “vestigial” organs or structures use is actually. They once thought the human tailbone was a vestigial tail, yet it is an essential connection point of the nerves and tendons. We have so few whale species that an examination of the function of its hip is extremely difficult. Also you can only say that 99.99 percent of all life is extinct if you in the believe in the assumption of millions of years. Because most of those creatures within that long timeframe are gone. Also, in human history we are the cause for many species going extinct, if there where once creatures like T-Rex walking with man we would have probably killed it for sport. Our God also did not design the world as we see it today, he did design it perfect even if his idea of perfection is not ours. Also what speciation is true macro-evolution? Bacteria to bacteria, and fish to fish is still micro-evolution or adaptation. And if evolution is the cause of life on earth; how did life begin? A pot of goo And a little lightning, yet even still scientists cannot create a bacteria out of raw matter. And if an intelligent scientist successfully makes a fully functioning reproducing bacteria. Can you still honestly call that random natural selection?

Why not? A designer could be flawed like a human. Why couldn't he be?
Also, if you prefer to take the God of the Bible: The Bible states that humans were created in God's image which should make them at least have the potential of being as intelligent as he is.

""Also, what makes you think the designer of such a door is ""intelligent""?""
Good point. 😅
But you do see that stuctures which apparently serve no purpose do not disprove a designer?
Also, there are different explanations than a stupid designer, like standardised production, for example.
Which brings me to a possible explanation for the palmaris longus:
Even though the absence of the muscle itself doesn't have any known consequences, it is still unclear if  changes to the gene(s) involved in losing the muscle may have other consequences. So, maybe the genes were reused for a different purpose (like a subroutine in programming) with the side effect of having the muscle and since its presence doesn't have any negative consequences neither, the designer didn't bother to change it.",1
"Mr Özyildirim
Where does the Bible state that God is infallible?

Maybe all religions are wrong, that doesn't disprove a designer.

""I was just wondering what mental gymnastics you people would come up with.""
Please define ""you people"" for me or are you just another person who doesn't know what ""playing devil's advocate"" means?

""It's already disproven by all the contradictory evidence (i.e. evolution, which has been observed numerous times)""
This is what people like you say all of the time, however, this claim is exactly what my comment is putting to a test. To just claim that something has been disproven is not evidence!

""Your conclusion is based on your premise, not evidence.""
So is yours if you say that a designer could not create a structure which doesn't serve a purpose despite the evidence showing you that it is possible.
If there is a different explanation for a piece of evidence then it cannot be considered to prove a theory. It just doesn't disprove the theory.
There is a difference between saying that evolution is a very good theory which does explain all observations and is most likely true and claiming that evolution is fact, therefore any alternative isn't possible. 
The former is science the latter is dogma.

About palmaris longus:

"   Sorry for misspelling ""straight"". English is not my native language. But you are wrong. Evolution is an observable fact.

"Emily Sorenson 

Everything in the universe developed from the fundimental particles that were present 1x10-34 seconts after the big bang.  

Gravity didn't come from anywhere. It is an emergent property of matter.  What makes you think it needs to come from somewhere? 

The nebulae come from mater ejected from dead stars.  Everything apart from hydrogen was forged in the heart of a star by nuclear fusion.  If you really want to know this stuff there are plenty of good books and even more peer reviewed papers available giving mre detail.

There are two 'gaps' in our understanding.
1) How did the original conditions of the big bang arise.
2) What was the mechanism of abiogenesis.

For (1) we don't know the answer and may never know. But although I don't know, i don't think you do either.  Not knowing doesn't give you licence to make it up.  Even if I granted you that whatever caused these conditions is something we'll call god, you still have all your work ahead of you to demonstrate any property of this god.

For (2) we have a reasonable idea.  We may never find the exact process but we may well have a full demonstration of potential processes.  We already know that the necessary organic molecules can spontaniously arise from simple elements and compounds that would have been present in the early earth.  Again, even if i grant you god setting this going, you still have all your work ahead of you to prove anything about this god.

People evolved. We start with self replication molecules.  Something like RNA that can self catalise.  Maybe very simple, more like a protine.  If it is in procimity to lipids they spontainiously form a miniscus and you have a 'living' cell.  Errors during replication result in changes to the orgaism and those which provide an advantage reproduce more effectively and eventually out compete the original organism.  Over time live diversifies and becomes more complicated.  Eventually a type of hominid living in social groups masters fire enabling meat to be cooked and the high protine diet allows the evolution of larger brains amd more intelligence.  That leads to us.

Why do you assume that just because you are ignorant of the facts that others are too?  Did you not think i would actually knkw the answers?

What's more, even if I didn't, what makes you think that my not having an explanation makes yours more credible?  Your explanation stands or falls on it's own merits, so what do you have to back up your claims?

Did you have a proper answer for why Genisis 1:1-5 clearly violates what we know to be true about how the cycle of day and night occur? Do you even know who wrote Genisis?  All you have given is some sort of tapdance that doesn't even address the problem and isn't supported by the text.  Then you claim again that the bible is 100% right.  How may things do i have to show you that are wrong in the bible before you admit that the bible isn't 100% correct?  

Let's just ask the question.  What would I need to do to show that the bible isn't 100% accurate?

You keep asserting that the bible is true but do you have anything to back up that claim?",1
Nicholas where did the Big Bang come from? Just because it’s a tv show doesn’t mean it’s true (assuming u watch it... I don’t ) everything needs to come from somewhere. Where did the dead stars come from? If you needed nebulae for stars to form how did the stars die if there weren’t stars? Because there wasn’t nebula bc there wasn’t any dead stars. No idk how the Big Bang happened bc I don’t believe it. Maybe I can’t demonstrate God but you can’t completely prove evolution either. As an example to your statement... clouds make rain. Right? So how does the rain fall? And I’m sure there is scientific proof that clouds are made from molecules or atoms or something. Ok idc. Yeah true but where do the molecules or atoms come from? Just appear? Or did God create them?  What is easier to believe? Seriously? We evolved and organisms started changing? All those things? Science and school is very important but when talking about these things... the truth.... all those things go behind. The truth... God... outrules science. Like I said... maybe I can’t prove God and prove all tye things about God are true... but you can’t prove evolution either. You may think u can... but u can’t completely. And how is it possible that brains started to grow larger and smarter? And we just became? Seriously 😒? That is completely.... there is no word for it... bc it’s not true.  I have you an answer about genesis 1:1-5 and even if it doesn’t satisfy you then forget about that. You’re obviously to much of a stubborn person to understand the truth.  And the most accurate answer for an author is Moses.  And go ahead.... keep making a fool out of yourself by “ trying to tell me the Bible is wrong”. Ok if the Bible is wrong... or not true... why would 40+ people spend SO much time writing books if they were fake? Not even the dumbest person would do that.,1
"Emily Sorenson 

I'll reply breifly to your other points separately.  The reply below is about science, evolution and the big bang.

Science doesn't 'prove' things in the sense you are using the word 'proof'.  What it does is provide explanations for observed facts that make predictions about what future facts will look like.  

It starts with a hypothisis, which is nasically a guess.  But that guess comes with predictions of what we should find if the guess is right and what things we could find that would prove the guess wrong.  If it gets proved wrong it is falsified and is disgarded. When it has demonstrated that the explanation is capable if explaining the known facts and has consistantly shown predictive power we call it a thoery.  

You are clearly not scientifically literate (not your fault and not meant as a criticism) so if you would like to go a little deeper i can help and i can help to show you the there is sufficient evidence to accept that evolutionary theory is correct and that the big bang occurred.  

Ultimately, though, it is a journey you have to take by yourself.  What would you like to do?",1

"Emily Sorenson 

""Because I believe the Bible.  That's how I know"".  Do you see what you've done there? You have conflated two different concepts.  How does belief turn into knowledge?  Now, this is a big issue in philosophy, what counts as knowledge.  One definition is 'justified true belief' and by justified they mean evidenced.  It's the 'if you can't show it, you don't know it' definition.  You, by your own admission can't show it, so on what basis do you make a knowledge claim?

I think what you actually have is ""i believe it because i believe it"".  

Isn't belief what you need because you don't know?

What, then, is your belief actually based on if it's not based on knowledge?

So in respect to the bible, how do we assess if the claims in it are true?  How would you propose we establish that? Lets look at the most important ones.
1) The creation narative.
2) The fall
3) The birth of Jesus
4) The death and resurection of jesus

"wade5941 well honesty, I assumed that to give you the benefit of the doubt. When it comes to the evidence supporting evolution I can’t imagine how someone who invested energy and time looking into what is known and how we know it would leave thinking.... Nah, that’s questionable at best. It would be like me handing you 2 apples and telling you that you have 2 apples and you saying.... Nah that’s questionable at best. What exactly is it that you find questionable?

Wait....Did you say you have a PhD in environmental engineering? And you don’t accept the influence humans have on climate change? Really? It’s almost like I’m talking to a Republican evangelical Christian or a Muslim I’m baffled.....LoL okay you have all the facts and wow you just don’t believe it????",1
"wade5941 Evolution is as much a fact and as observable and you can repeat experiments showing it occurs. At this point I usually go step by step with radiometric dating, fossil evidence, dna evidence, comparative anatomy evidence, and a long list of other supporting facts which I may have to do later. I want to take a new approach 

Here are facts I think we will agree on. 
1) Evolution is a fact (meaning changes in allele frequencies do occur) 
2) Life has existed for 3+ Billion years. 
3) The oldest life we’ve discovered includes prokaryotes and eukaryote.
4) Species can and do go extinct.
5) Life shows up in our fossil record and later it vanishes from the fossil record 
6) Using comparative anatomy we can show life that has similar characteristics to older lifeforms. 
Option One:
Life changes over time through a slow process of micro changes which accumulate over 1000s of generations allowing life the ability to adapt in an ever changing world. 
Option Two
Life does not change over time. Life pops into existence fully formed and then it goes extinct. It is then replaced with new slightly different life that magically popped out of thin air into life with fully equipped immune systems, slight improvement body structures that can deal with ever changing conditions on Earth.

What other options can you come up with that explains the changes in life that doesn’t involve evolution or magic? 

Please point to one fact about evolution that you think isn’t supported by sufficient evidence.",1

"KB9OKB,
Why are you are contradicting yourself? In one sentence you claim to understand evolution as ""slow change over time"". Later on you are claiming that ""… there is no evidence that any animal has developed a NEW feature, like a wing, where it's parents did not have a wing"" which is a sudden, large change occurring in a single individual in a single generation, NOT a ""slow change over time"" as you previously claimed to understand. Do you understand that it is populations which evolve, not individual organisms?
I'm curious, you seem to be demanding quite rigorous standards of evidence for claims which you don't want to be true, but would you dare apply the same rigorous standards of evidence to your own claims?",1

 Ricahrd P'Brien  what example have we seen of one species given birth to another.,1
"  
None, because that would FALSIFY or DISPROVE the various theories explaining how evolution happens. Nothing in the theory of evolution claims that one species suddenly gives birth to another. How could you become so misinformed? Do you think that maybe the people you most trusted to tell you the truth, have abused that trust and deliberately and intentionally lied to you?",1
   the same could be said about evolution it's taken as a fact now like a flat earth or earth that's the center of the universe was taken then. Until couple great minds disproved those.

The vestigial bones in cetaceans are genetically and developmentally homologous to hind limbs and we can directly observe in any cetaceans' embryonic development that they have four limbs and the two hind limbs resorb into the small bones they have when they are born, and sometimes an atavism can occur in which they don't resorb and remain hind flippers through to adulthood such as the dolphin found off the coast of Japan, what did I assume exactly?",1

"To add to Tbat87,  There are nkt good arguments on both sides.  One side uses logic and reason backed by evidencen. The other uses endless strawmen, arguements from ignorance, arguements from incredulity, nirvana fallacies and equivication fallacies to defend a presuposition that an anonymous iron age book is inerrant.

There is evidence that there is a relationship between knowledge of evolution and acceptance of it.  It doesn't mean itcs a causal link, that research hasn't been done but it is noticable how much effort creationist appologist put into strawman arguements amd deliberately keeping their followers ignorant of the facts.

The reason this video doesn't address the counter arguments is because it is a science video and there are no scientific counter arguements.  If you want those watch the crash course religion or philosophy videos.

Evolution is a thing because thebevidnce proves it is a thing.  What evidence that it is not a thing do you think was missed?",1

"   When did that happen?  The ""straying"", I mean.  I guess you mean at the so-called Reformation (though, if you are Eastern Orthodox, you could go for the Great Schism of 1054).  Now what puzzles me about your ""straying"" claim is the length of time it took God to get orthodoxy sorted (from the Greek words orthos ('right') and doxa ('belief')). The Reformation started in the early 16th C, so just under 1600 years seems a tad inefficient IMO, especially for an omnipotent, omni-benevolent deity. You don't specify which flavour of the faith you have chosen (clearly NOT RC, of course) but (another guess) it probably doesn't date date to Luther's 1517 Theses.  What makes you so sure YOU are (small letter o ) orthodox?",1

What makes you think that?  Have you actually examined each claim and looked properly at the counterarguments?

Start at Genisis 1:1-5.  God makes light and dark, day and night in cycles.  It's still three days before the sun and stars appear. So where does the light come from? How, without the earth rotating relitive to the sun, do you get night and day?

So right off the bat its wrong.

Try to be a bit more critical.  The bible certainly isn't 100% right.",1
What education has led you to that conclusion?,1
They are the same type though they are birds that’s not proof of evolution because they did not completely evolve into another type of animal? So common ancestry and descending from each other is still nullified.,1

"Hi, just a question: exocytosis and endocytosis occur independently of concentration gradients, right? It's a process to move large molecules, and even though it's active transport (requires ATP/energy), it can sometimes happen 'down' a gradient. (It's not always moving molecules against the concentration gradient). It's just that the molecules can't move themselves cuz they're too large, so they have to be transported in vesicles. Is that correct?",1

At the moment, I'm hoping to make them a sort of superorganism with colonies of different prokaryotes providing specialised functions (vision, motion, etc.) to the larger organism.

Wouldnt this be hindered when RBCs beta globin is mutated forming a sickle shape and adopting a structure with a much more smaller surface area. On top of that limiting oxygen binding and transportation across the body.",1

"Consider the following:
a. We are taught that we should treat others how we ourselves would like to be treated, basically the 'golden rule'.
b. If an individual causes society to suffer, society often causes the individual to suffer.
c. But now, with individuals who want to die, especially terminally ill people, and society keeps them alive, maybe because society writes a law whereby suicide for any reason is illegal, then society is prolonging the suffering of the individual first.
d. The individual would then have the 'right' to prolong societies' suffering since society prolonged the individual's suffering first, and since we are supposed to treat others how we would like to be treated, obviously society must want to have their suffering prolonged.  Otherwise, why is society prolonging the suffering of the individual first?

Hence, since I am terminal with cancer, and society here in Michigan won't let me die, I will prolong societies' suffering, due to that must be how society wants me to treat them since they treated me that way first.  I will do it via telling society the real truth about life and their future.

The 6th mass extinction event has already started on this Earth, most of you are all going to die, most probably a horrible death too.  AND life itself is all ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things, at least from Earthling's perspective.  There is more, but I will prolong your suffering.  (Just trying to keep the suffering books balanced here.)

Why won't you let terminally ill people die who want to die?  Why are you prolonging the suffering of your fellow human being?  But by doing so, and since you did it to me first, I have the 'right' per the 'golden rule' to now do it to you.
Paybacks can be a bitch.  All you had to do was let me die.  What was so terribly horrible about that?

Especially considering that our true destiny is:
1. We are ALL going to die one day from something.
2. We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced.
3. We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.

"I feel like the PKU example where changing their diet to prevent the disease, does not make the heritability 0%. Or if it does, I'm missing some nuance about heritability.

It looks like more contractors and civilians were killed in action than those in the military? Do they exhibit suicide rates similar to veterans? It doesn't sound like they do? What is the difference?

"Good lecture but flipped between endorsing genetics and then environment in a way that didn't stress the delicate balance between these two phenomena/ideas. His endorsement of the environment is not unfounded and is crucial but its presentation is somewhat far leaning and trashing of genetics (i.e. genes and sex chromosomes) and its interplay with environment. I guess his reason for doing this is to counterbalance societal narratives about the importance of biology and its determinism of behaviour and other traits. Which has and still leads to ideologies that discriminate individuals and groups leading to minor and disastrous consequence. This emphasis needs to be made but also be made modestly, as instead of correcting the capsized boat it could also just go around full circle. Also to note this course is an ""introduction"", not meaning that to trash the professor and his efforts here as they are amazing, but just that these fields as he stated at the start are more broad and nuanced from what he does here. Hence assumptions or generalisations are made in a respect to make it palatable and sometimes this can be affected by bias, as with everything. Harkening back to his rhetoric at the first lecture, these are all small parts of the puzzle each with their own flavours. One can easily be transfixed on a statement or flavour that confirms their inclinations. Maybe this lecture series will be more balanced, from my perspective, coming up. ""But stay woke"" as Childish Gambino says",1
"Did they compare the male results to each other among the 40 countries too? Because it might be that girls' results increased as equality was achieved, but perhaps male ones decreased dramatically compared to the ones achieved in masculinity and competition driven countries, where females ostracize low achievement. Prof. Sapolsky, I expected better from you than to disregard checking that",1
"The problem with the argument about math performance and such using this equality index is that it's a form of circular reasoning, since whether or not a country scores high on the index is dependent on the outcomes women achieve:
Let's say the ""natural"" outcome without any cultural interference would be a huge disadvantage for women on a certain metric, well that would count as massive inequality. In other words, for this metric, the only way to achieve ""equality"" on the equality index would be to somehow give women a huge leg up where otherwise they wouldn't have parity. The underlying assumption is that equal rights result in numerical parity and equal outcomes, and thus that equal outcomes prove equal opportunity/rights.

Just as I noticed at the introduction lecture, whenever something got mentioned that came close to ""women are better than men"" there was laughter, not the kind you will hear in a comedy club though. 


Also taken from the introduction lecture is that often groups will use this information as a political weapon. Does one study favor women, or does one study of the same subject favor men? I'd rather not be in the position of writing an answer that respects both genders and will not be turned into a weapon for either gender to bash each other with.",1

"1:25:58 my motto is gonna be this soon “don’t you ever trust the scientists conclusions”. Your conclusion is that difference in math skills are different by the country ergo oh damn this must be environmental. Ok What’s in common? They treat differently on different genders so huh we just found the environmental factor see? all genders are equal yey! Do you know what else is also in common Tunisia turkey and south korea? THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS FOLKS maybe not right now but they were ones. And do you know how conservative folks get married? With arranged marriages. And do you know how arranged marriages are done? Do you know how people choose their partners? They don’t. Their family does. My grandma got married with a man she never knew about. And so does my grandpa. She was pretty he had a job and good income. 
In conservative societies womens doesn’t gets to be chosen for their math skills or their intelligence. They get choosen because their pretty. But for mens better math skills has better chances of having better jobs etc.
my point is evolution worked on different ethnicities in a slightly different way. Yes maybe a environment is also another factor but  not that big as much as 17:1 ratio. 
I am born and raised Turkish and i can say that in schools boys treated same as the girls yet boys are much much better at math on average. 

Here’s another example.  in turkey womens have an average levels of beauty yet mens are ugly as hell and this is a well known fact. If you’re look at Scandinavian countries there’s no significant beauty difference between men are women. Does that mean oh we should look for environment? Noooo 

Your previous deductions on depression etc did made perfect sense. So im not denying the effects of the environment. Im just saying like you said at the start it’s easier to spot the difference in diseases behavior and characteristics are more complicated than that and it can easily be misinterpreted.",1

Can that be that arbitrariness is not common to all animal communication (e.g. dogs)... that is it is degraded from humans down to lower species... ?",1
"CAN A COLLEGE STUDENT REALLY ""ACQUIRE"" A PHENOMENAL VOCABULARY OF 60,000 WORDS?
At 47:00, Prof. Sapolsky emphasizes the explosive acquisition of new words by children. ""By college, a typical person has a vocabulary of 60,000 words...There is an innate drive towards language acquisition."" This number floats along the waves of demonstrating that kids are able to generate structures of grammar they have never learnt or encountered before, i.e. 47:55 ""They are constructing rules out of imperfect, partial examples...You can have statistical learning."" At 48:12 ""You can pick up the rules from statistical patterns."" This is the key Chomsky argument. Still, this seems more aimed at generating constructions, rather than generating words. Generating new words is not as easy. There are a few ways that can generate new words by using some simple rules. For instance, from grammar, you get grammatical, perhaps grammarian (?), ungrammatical, grammatically, etc..But that does not get too far, here in fact you’re just deriving variations on the same basic word, not acquiring a new word.  
The number of ""60,000 words"" at college level seems simply a rhetorical exaggeration to make a basic point, not a scientific result. Even if you imply passive recognition and understanding in listening and reading, rather than active acquisition and  use in speech and writing. Note that a taxi driver can get by with 50 to 100 words, ordinary daily life requires at most a few hundred words (if that many). A college student may get by with 1,000 words, and that is already a huge number. Only a small % of the population is called upon to use a wide variety of words. Mainly professionals of language, who use it all day long: writers and speakers: lawyers, politicians, diplomats, orators, journalists, teachers, academics, comedians, preachers, etc. — perhaps 10% of the global population. Their children start life with a huge linguistic advantage: They are exposed from an early age to the richer vocabulary and advanced sentences of their parents. Note, in the same vein, that Prof. Sapolsky's father had been an academic professor, a historian of architecture — an early mentoring support that must have given our learned Professor an early stimulation and continued guidance for developing his own passion for using words.  
A top professional writer with many known books to his credit may use up to 5- 6,000 different words. The Belgian writer Georges Simenon is famous for having written 500 books using only (computer count) 2,500 words. A similar statistic could be set for science writer Isaac Asimov, also with 500 published books under his pen. The Authorized King James Version of the Bible uses 12,143 different English words for a total count of 783,000 words (or about 1.5%). Milton reaches that level of 12,000 different words. And Shxpr is alone in his class, with a never-equalled use of about 20,000 different words (ignoring the easy variants of the same basic word), according to David Crystal, in a grand total of 884,647 words. Of those, over 1,700 words were the first recorded use in English, although many of his creations didn't stick. In terms of creating new words that have become accepted ""neologisms"", radically new words accepted in the common language,, Milton is the top generator in English with 630 words added to the body of the English language, against Ben Jonson with 558, John Donne with 342 and Shakespeare with 229.
But ""acquiring"" (whatever that means) 60,000 words? As a college student? Not in your wildest dreams.
A wonderful exercise could be to just scan all the 27 lectures in Prof. Sapolsky's course presented here by Stanford on YouTube, and thanks to the subtitles, count the different vocabulary being used. Then add to the review the words in his 6 or 7 books, and count again. No need to include the public lectures, or various articles, as they practically use all the vocabulary already recorded in the lectures and the books, and would add only marginal new stuff. So what would be one good estimate of the total different words? 5 to 6, 000 words? That would already be pretty sensational. True, you could argue, Prof. Sapolsky certainly ""knows"" many more words passively than the active vocabulary he's used in his lectures and writing. Granted, but then, as a wild stretch, twice as many? As a (generous) guess, say 10 to 12,000 total? Perhaps. That, in our pleasant flight of fantasy, would put our Stanford Professor in the Milton and Bible class. But, still, no way ever to get to 60,000 words. And we're no longer speaking of a college level here, but of a passionate, unstoppable, full-time, expert professional word user.",1

Mystic... beautiful dreaming
Magical... harmony
Musical... language of music
Artistic... pictures/metaphors
Poetic... language of words
Numerical... we are here

Mystics create the most joy (smart). Accountants create the least joy (ignorant). Yet accountants rule the world (ignorant).

Ever notice that beings who speak in the language of music can create joy that energizes thousands of beings to celebrate and dance?

Ever notice that corpses who speak with brain numbing, soul sucking numbers do the exact opposite?

Sanction, starve, torture, murder and bomb (wheeeee)!  Ignorance (hate) is bliss for vampires (greed). But not much fun for the humans (love) who they are sucking the joy out of.

Vampires (greed) are inhumane because they are not human. The evangelical counting corpses commit crimes against humanity because they are not human.

Light and truth (love) cause vampires (greed) great pain and suffering. That's why the words democratic society (socialism), ""care for all"" and ""green new deal"" cause the counting corpses that rule US such misery.

Vampires (greed) are ""blind"" and cannot ""see"" the ignorance of transforming heaven (peace) into hell (war).

The counting corpses are also blind and cannot see the ignorance of transforming this paradise planet lifeboat into a polluted pig pen.

The evangelical monsters are ""desperate"" to control a darkship called the Whitehouse. Because working in the dark to suck the joy out of life and devour earth is the only way that the loveless, lifeless parasites can survive and thrive.

Unlike earthling poets, artists, musicians, mystics,human beings and creators of joy...the evangelical counting corpses that rule US can't create harmony (real intelligence) because vampires (greed) are far worse than stupid. The loveless, lifeless parasites are ignorant (dead).

Darkness (business) exists so that stars (light and warmth) have a place to shine in heaven.

Stars like US don't exist to be sucked out of heaven by a giant black hole in space called ""greed"" and it's ignorance (hate).

Also, Love (god) spent billions of years creating this paradise planet lifeboat so that her miraculous works of fine art called ""life"" have a beautiful place to ""be"".

Love didn't spend so much time creating this paradise planet lifeboat to be depreciated, hated, polluted and destroyed in a brief moment by hostile alien vampires (greed) and their ignorance (hate).",1

Let's expand, rather than limit, our creativity. How much do you think tolkien and star trek languages expand what children do? How much is beethoven's dissonance and it's integration, picasso's painting, joyces writing, from the requirement to leave behind mannered and derived productions in order to be truly creative? How much is repetition of what has been done actually creative?",1

What he’s saying is not that complex, he’s simply a great speaker/teacher in presenting it. The reason we have fun following his thoughts is because on some level we have had similar ones ourselves.

Who hasn’t wondered as a child if your perception of ‘green’ isn’t the same as someone else’s—or some other such thought? 

As for atomic, subatomic & quantum phenomena, how could there be any reference point for our monkey brain to “picture” it or fully grasp any of it. Physics is our only interpreter, and it’s becoming clear that it has been bumping up against its own limits in that capacity, for several decades now. It’s a bit depressing.

I regularly read papers that are brilliant and mathematically thorough and imaginative—aided by modern digital tools—but are dead thud stupid in the assumptions they’re forced to depend on.",1

"   Since you are not familiar with quantum physics, I would not like to get into that stuff. Instead, I would like you to consider something which is representative of the situation.

"I feel like although Feynman is a gifted  theoretical physicist, what we need in this world are ....what he described HERE. We need scientists to discover how to teach people. To teach them in the way THEY need to learn. That would maximize everyone's learning to their greatest potential. We need our finest minds working on world peace, not war. They are so smart, why can't they solve the differences between nations? Imagine if WW2 had never happened? 50 million would have never died.

"   idealistic?  Not if you consider that nature is the real system that holds us ALL up... and is right now collapsing here locally on Earth.. but yes I can be a little romantic about saving a suffering mother.  Anyway ""universe"" surprisingly is interchangeable for nature, and just esoteric.  The periodic table of elements that make up our physical reality are not localized, but rather universal... scattered throughout the cosmos.  This means that the dimensions are constant here as they would be thousands of light years away...  and given a multiverse of similar material universes, most likely made up of these same elements, only scattered about differently... so again we have universal elements, existing in a universal or natural law based system.  My post was not necessarily a dig at RF... but rather a point at why so many see math and physics as another form of ""white privilege"" ...as instead of using logical, consistent terminology throughout science and math to make it easy , inclusive, diverse, accepting, we get a lot of so called important white people.  it might be better re-imagine formulas, constants, equations, problems, etc. outside of the dominating white male... and name things based on the common sense of what we can observe in nature or our everyday physical world?",1

How would you account for the wizards born to two muggle parents though? It would have to be a recessive trait wouldnt it? Only being expressed if two parents are carriers AND only 1/4 chance of that. But then I'm not sure how it would work for the squibs because being from two wizard parents who would have to have both recessive for the gene to be expressed there is 100 percent chance of wizard child... so would the squib be the mutation? some how having that gene turned off,1

What is the genetic cause that causes a green morph of an insect frequency to oscillate except genetic drift?,1
"For random mutations to become expressed in the descendants it would take many generations right? If I have a mutation, I will pass the rescesive gene to my children but unless it's the dominant variety it won't be expressed. So until many generations down the line when someone picks up both recessive genes it will be expressed.
On top of that the current gene would have to die out for the mutation to become permanent or they would simply coexist right?

"Something I've always wondered about with dominant/recessive alleles is, are there more than just dominant and recessive? One scenario would be a range of dominance with three or more alleles. For instance if you had three alleles a, A, and A*. a would be recessive to both A and A*, A would be recessive to A* but dominant to a, and A* would be dominant to both a and A. Or, what about a rock paper scissor situation? You would have three or more alleles each being dominant to one but recessive to another.",1

"killerbee256 I'd agree with you there. Science can be proven very well. We can not be 100% sure of our origins, but we're pretty damn sure. One thing we do know is that evolution has happened. Smallpox affected the Native Americans so much, but the Europeans weren't affected by it at the time. Why? They got used to smallpox, or adapted to it, and it didn't affect them anymore, while other human beings were affected who had never seen smallpox before. Just as an example there. Evolution has happened in our history, and we have observed adaptations and mutations in many things, from moths in the Industrial Era with the birch forests, or other famous examples, I've said it once and I say it again. We're pretty damn sure.

So, one thing that always made me wonder: why am I so weird?"" is that, when I drink, I pee WAAAAAY more than everybody else. And it starts asa I begin drinking. Like. 2 beers and I have to pee. And the pee is clear.

Therefore, I should have a huge headache (cuz of dehydration) and, consequentely, what is called a ""hangover"".

You should be afraid of those weak cowards.  Nothing more dangerous than a programed person in fear and weak minded...

You should roll man.

You jr college can usually create units for HS
So can all sorts of teacher at any of your HS's in your district ( if you have more than one.)

Just talk to some teacher that seem sort cool

Its 3 units

Guessing ur on semester system rather than quarter.

I went to both in his

You should be able to pick up that up with some project...  Like a specific report...


Sports or extra curricular can transfer to credits too

You do anything else in your spare time?

Do you have a job?
Work experience can transfer too.

As for your parents anyone that call the cops on you is a tool and you don't need them.

They are weak and power trumpets that feel they have no power in life .
They are gelded
And have lost Thier spirit 
And are using a machine to punish you

Ditch them

Ireland has citizenship by descent... 
Going back to great grandparents
Just call the registrar offices get Thier birth records you need Thier name an Thier birth year and Thier county.
It's like 50euros 

Then you can go to the irish embassy pre print the forms online at the library or school

Your a minor don't worry about the grand theft auto your parents gifted you.  Don't bring it up.  if they do get your story straight you borrowed it because you have the keys and __ your friend/girlfriend need help was being abused or you need to go to work.  Or you didn't feel safe ...

You live in the ghetto and your parents are abusive.  

Differ the experience to get away the experience.  They are not your parents thier pod people leave them

Once you get irish citizenship.  Enroll in a community college raise your gpa stateside or in ireland.  As for government help...

When your GPA is solid, if not already you can than apply for grands to go to any school in the united kingdom...  English feel bad about Thier thousand years of abuse to ireland before going and doing the abuse on a larger scale world wide well practiced at home ...  So irish don't pay for schooling in UK institutions...

If you want a trade then it's even easier...

Get out of there.  Set your fear aside it's the parasite controlling your mind 
You have nothing to fear

Build your life and then only then maybe come back and visit.  Maybe never... It's up to you whence you have started and finished the build

Military is also an option and a good one... You can join up rt now...  Go for a branch you family has history in.

"Michael Seo  It isn't a YouTube comment if it doesn't start or end with an insult, right?

I asked for a defintion of ""murder"". The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines it as, ""the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought""(http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder). ""Unlawfully"" can be understood as equal to ""unjust"", which would mean that any murder is by definition ""not justified"", making any argument to the contrary redudant. 
However, if we generally talk about killing someone, then yes, as I stated before, there are good reasons to kill people. For example, your own survival could depend on it. Few people would, for example, consider a killing in self-defense to be ""unjust"".
An argument can also be made that even the killing of an innocent bystander might be justified, if his death is necessary to save your own life or one who is dear to you. For example, you might consider it justified that some jewish families killed their screaming babies to avoid being caught during the holocaust. There are of course many who'd argue that killing someone innocent is always immoral and therefore unjust, but many would argue as well that it can be moral and just - depending on the moral framework you have. It would be, therefore, morally ambiguous, which does not flat out equal ""immoral"" or ""unjust"".  
Classical christian morality would lean towards condeming the killing of an innocent person, no matter if the potential killer was trying to avoid a greater evil by doing so. Aristocratic morality would allow it to be considered ""just"" to kill an innocent person, if there is an equal or greater gain, weighing against the obviously unfortunate necessity. 

Since I have no chance of justifying to kill someone for personal gain, like getting into Stanford, when starting from Christian morality, I do it with aristocratic morality instead. Lets say I'm the first on the waiting list and need someone who is already in to drop out again for me to get in. Assuming this is my only shot to get a proper education, which I will in turn use to achieve great success and power, to make a legacy of myself, then yes, proponents of aristocratic morality would say, that it is just for me to take any measure necessary to secure that education. After all, what inherent responsibility do I have to anyone but myself? (.. would one rhetorically ask with this moral framework in mind.) Bare im mind: many historic personalities who are generally admired for their deeds didn't stop in killing innocent people to achieve their goals and surely considered this to be ""just"" at the time. 

Anyone with even the least bit creativity can come up with many more scenarios in which killing someone can be justified. It is easier from within aristocratic morality than from within christian (more specifically, New Testament) morality, but it can be done with that too.

And now, my plebeian friend, I've said probably ""enuff"" on the matter and let you respond with whatever depth of thought you can muster. (Excuse me for this; it is a YouTube comment, after all.)

"Thinking about the last part of ""where do humans stand in the tournament vs. pair-bonding"" tableau, I wonder how this developed evolutionary over time. Looking at our closest relatives, where do they stand (knowing that things could have changed a lot since our ancestry lines have diverged)? Maybe we are evolutionary on our way from a tournament to a pair-bonding species? Maybe the other way around? From the first two lectures on youtube I get the notion that I have a wrong idea of the concept of ""culture"" as a human specific thing, depending if you think of it as the underlying behavioral biologic mechanism that in higher vertebrates and primates ultimately lead to recognizable patterns. What is the influence of a species being self-conscious about their culture in that case?

"Fascinating lecture, but I don't think the normative judgments at the end follow. Just because a spectrum is observed in nature does not mean that the extremes are desirable and the middle is ""confused, screwed up"". Each species' collection of traits is just what they've ended up with due to the selection pressures they've faced. Are we ""confused"" because we're in the middle of the mass scale between mosquitoes and elephants?

It seems like our species has tended toward equilibrium at the point where ""both sexes exhibit cheating behaviors"" (males can go off into tournament behavior (war) to try to enter the polygamous fraction of the population, females can expect some amount of parenting behavior from abandoned males). I wonder if that follows from having the ability to consider your own and your emotionally-attached offspring's fate consciously.",1

"1:30:40 --- He seems to suggest abandoning the children is common among females in 'pair-bond species' (and seems to imply it's not also common among males). I wonder why. If females sometimes leave and hope the male keeps the children alive, why wouldn't males sometimes leave and hope the female keeps the children alive? After all, the situation is the same, whether the male or the female leaves first, the other one is left with the children, possibly able to make them survive, and condemning them to death when leaving as well. 

I'd have guessed it'd still be more common among males in those species, because the females have more to lose. If both parents abandon the children and they die, the male invested less (just sperm, compared to egg, pregnancy, possibly nurturing --- pregnancy alone seems like a huge cost). I could understand it being rare among both males and females in such species, but it specifically occurring among females baffles me.

I love how this professor injects humor in his lecture. Listening to this I find science really cool and genetics - awesome! I missed going back to school. It's interesting how he relates molecular genetics to the study of human biology and disease. How does the cell choreograph the events of cell division so that only one copy of each gene is passed on to the next generation? By what processes do genes become altered to provide the raw material for evolution? The possibility of finding answers to such fundamental questions makes molecular genetics an exciting field of biology. Good job Stanford.,1

"Hegel conjectured ""evolution is a dialectical process"", what he meant was never properly looked into, but we can draw conclusions, based on our observation of evolution, and how the genome,(in conjunction with the impression of the environment on the brain), bring about evolution. This genome itself evolved from a simpler genome defined by the standard model of particle physics,that cosmologists employ to explain the evolution of the inorganic world of stars and galaxies where elements, molecules, organic molecules, and on to life and intelligence are produced.So what does Hegel's laws of dialectics have to do ?
     His laws of dialectics has mathematical representation on a complex plane that defines two different types of opposites: Opposites and duals (defined according to the algorithm of complex analysis). These two types of opposites are the simplest genome, that we can speculate to be responsible for the evolution of everything in the universe.

"Molecular Biology and Genetics seek to understand how the molecules that make up cells determine the behavior of living things. Biologists use molecular and genetic tools to study the function of those molecules in the complex milieu of the living cell. Groups in our department are using these approaches to study a wide variety of questions, including the fundamental processes of transcription and translation, mechanisms of global gene control including signal transduction pathways, the function of the visual and olfactory systems, and the nature of genetic diversity in natural populations and how that affects their evolution, among others. The systems under study cover the range of model organisms (bacteria, yeast, slime molds, worms, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice) though the results of these studies relate directly or indirectly to human health.

I wonder when the notion of a hinged book was invented, or a codex instead of a roll, when the stirrup was created, when Bede wrote De temporum ratione with its descriptions of the universe as a working system including eclipses, etc., when Hildebrandslied (Song of Hildebrand) on identity and the self was written, or the work of disabled scientist, Hermann of Reichenau, was done. How could any such things come from such an age and place as described at the beginning? ""Unlike dates, periods are not facts. They are retrospective conceptions that we form about past events, useful to focus discussion, but very often leading historical thought astray."" (G. M. Trevelyan, historian, 1942)",1

• its like an interplay of dimensional information, in relation to cognition & experience; that leads to (perhaps?) dual representations & communications with or without mass?

I laughed out loud a few times in this lecture. He really has very little idea what he is talking about sometimes. Who told him that reduction predicts variability will go down as you get more precise? You would have to have virtually no understanding of what this is about to say that.,1
***** is he not periodically adding 1?,1
Do periods require a limit that doesn't equal infinity?,1
"!?
We say a function/processe or sequence f is periodic if there exists T>0 such that f(x+T)=f(x) for all x. T is then said the period if it is the smaller positive number with that property. Example: sin (x+2pi) = sin (x), for all x,  and no smaller T>0 exists such that sin (x+T)= sin (x), for all x

Hence neither 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n, ... (the sequence Sapolsky was referring to) is periodic nor 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ..., ( the sequence of differences between consecutives). 

I can't help you anymore...",1
Thank you professor. Can any one has link for after exercise about automata that sir talked at starting.

My question is: if force F_1 creates a periodicity k_1 (say k = 2), and F_2 creates a periodicity k_2 (say k = 4), then is there some force between the two, say F* = (F_1 + F_2)/2 such that the action is non-periodic (aka the period is odd)? 

In other words, is there some force (say F*) between two periodic force levels (say F_1 and F_2) which produces an odd periodicity?",1

In short, are computers able to detect a function where the sum of the parts is not equal to the resulting stuff ?

"SINGLE POINT ATTRACTOR:  Our solar system is being pulled to a single point attractor in the center of our galaxy, hence a spiral shaped galaxy.  (Orbital velocity plus gravity, spiral shape).  ONLY those species that make it out of this galaxy continue to consciously survive, everybody else dies and goes extinct.  And once out of the galaxy for those who make it, where are you going to go next and how long will it take to get there?

Also, in our chaotic life at times, the single attractor is 'death' that comes to us all.  We need a strange attractor to defeat death and have eternal life.  Basically, per the graph, we need to become a butterfly.  But, a butterfly in a never ending predestined path dictated by what came before it in a cause and effect sort of way?  Is that really the 'eternal life' we expected or wanted?  Basically, a universe that cycles over and over and over ..........???",1

"Consider the Scribes and Pharisee's.
It was the Scribes who wrote - via here-say, and compiled the old testament, along with the Pharisee's (leaders of the Synagogues).  Not one single book was even written by the supposed prophet, claimed as having said what was written, and even those were written sometimes hundreds of years later.  
The very same leaders and scripture writers whom the written 'Jesus' (which isn't even a Hebrew name) despised.  
Then consider the 'council of 300' (Wealthy, religious and otherwise) Elites (hmmm, we should trust them as well) led by a Roman Emperor (Oh yes, they can be trusted) who supposedly turned his faith to his God, along with all the other so called religious sycophants from around the world, decided amongst 100s of scriptures' around the ancient world, which ones to include and how to edit them as well. Who exactly were these 300 people and are we supposed to believe them, when it is a known fact that the old religions of Rome were being laughed at and scorned by the people, therefore a need for revision?   
This all compiled by the so called ""Holy Roman Church"", filled with psychopathic Senators, Pedophile priests and Jesuit madmen and enforced throughout  the world by their henchmen?
Yet people still believe it all?   There are still ancient paintings on some of the Vatican Buildings (at the rear) of Senators etc.   This means the Vatican is actually the very same Senate buildings of old as well.
Now I have to assume that the entirety of the collections are most likely in the Vatican library (off limits to the public) or destroyed or both. These (New Testament scriptures) all written in Greek, which as any historian of any credit will tell you, are always written, without a single instance, as Aphorism and metaphors (parables themselves are metaphors).
Not one single iota of factual evidence exists for any single script as to Orthodoxic truth...
It even states, as an axiom, that Jesus (again here-say decades later) said "" I speak in foolishness so that the wicked shall see, but not understand, hear, but not comprehend, but I tell you (the Apostles) what the real meanings are. That is it's truth. The entirety of the bible is meant to be understood as metaphoric knowledge. Never as actual written happenings!
What this means is that God put the foolish thought's into the writers and compilers minds as foolishness, so that they would believe they had the perfect pseudo religious propaganda and devious thieving and controlling system in place which still permeates today in every believer. The Vatican is so rich from it's theft that it staggers the mind.
So is the Anglican Church, which also rewrote their KJV according to the King's (OOH we trust them too don't we?) authorization of what translation of the old Greek and Latin would be allowed.
Now people are going hog wild believing the end is nigh, not comprehending for a moment that it is these very same Aristocratic relatives whom are making the very Apocalyptic things happen, even putting suspicious numbers (666) in their vaxxes and on their bar codes etc. (the real beast known as mammon which everything bought or sold.
 basically already has). They even created the worlds first 'Fed' - The 'City of London' banking community in September 1666 by edict of the King, who needed to borrow a lot of money for his wars and to pay for the great fire of London and the ""Cest Que Vie"" act, (which is also Roman Catholic) and is for and about the Maritime Admiralty Law of the sea - a bamboozle known by most educated people.  It is it's own legal country along with the Vatican.
 (religious) and Washington DC. (political), all legal by United Nations Decree? This Legislation managed to take over practically every Kingdom and Governmental system in the world, to our utter un-denounced regret, I might add. They, in effect, ripped up the Magna Carta and created the so called ""constitution"" in every English speaking and others, country as well but care not as they know it is an unsigned document which practically every single voter actually knows much about. An unsigned document holds no weight in their courts. Their courts are merely service corporations, again hoodwinking silly ""patriots"". see https://sagaciousnewsnetwork.net/the-corporation-of-the-united-states-of-america/   .Now it is becoming apparent that 1000 years of so called 'history' is written mostly by Catholic monks (that's not suspicious).  Making that year actually 666 and the true ""beast"" system, which they have the audacity to push the fear of God amongst everyone as well?",1

"We certainly found a lot of evidence under the ""Darwin thought leadership"" but evidence for what? 

Darwin's theory is that all living things are the descendant of a common ancestor modified by unguided natural processes such as natural selection and variation. But Darwin didn't write the book ""How the existing species changes over time"" That's not even relevant! Minor changes in species are not the issue here and yet when someone says there is an overwhelming evidence for Darwin's theory,  90% of what they are talking about is minor changes in existing species :) But that't not the point at all! 

The point is the origin of new species by the same ""natural"" process. But no one has ever observed the origin of the new species thru variation and selection and nothing even close to that. 

What I'm talking about it the fact, that the key element in Darwin's theory ""The origin of the species"" which is by the way paradoxically the title of his own book, has never been solved! 

We lacking a good evidence for Darwin's key mechanism. 

There have been many arguments and observations around the other potentially supportive theories and some of them are interesting indeed, but none of them are conclusive. Because you can argue the same way on the basis of intelligent design.",1

In nature its very difficult to survive, so having lighter fur gives bears an advantage over others in a snowy environment such as Canada. Because bears with lighter fur have a better chance of surviving and reproducing, after generations and generations the traits will be more pronounced, its a very gradual process. I hope that makes sense but if it doesn’t ill try to explain better.

The stripes on a zebra work well at confusing predators because it makes it harder for them to lock on to a single zebra. At least from my understanding",1

Yes it does. We've observed new speciation for almost 100 years now and new genera for 3/4 that long.

Perhaps a giraffe used to be a little shorter and gradually the taller ones ousted the smaller ones via natural selection, but natural selection doesn't explain macro-evolution, the way in which a species can just change into another species""
Not only does natural selection explain it but we understand the process so well we can replicate it in a laboratory. You didn't do very well in middle school biology did you?

""There is no evidence of that happening in our world...""
Yes there is. We've observed speciation on the regular for almost a century.

A/ “True, but why would species be ‘designs’?” Because that’s what my eyes observe and faculties of commonsense logic and reasoning tell me. When I observe anything man made, or nature made, fulfill a purpose extremely well, I observe extremely good design. I believe my eyes and what they see. 

B/ I explained above why there’s every reason to think life itself is designed. Random this and natural that doesn’t explain design, or purpose ‘observed’ in design.

"Gentlemen, I don't mean to ruffle your ""evolutionary feathers"" here, but
there are several leading scientific theories that cast serious doubts on the theory of macroevolution.  The Chaos Theory questions the concept of adaptation to the environment 
driven by natural selection, implies that environment does not produce complex adaptations, and says that evolution is chaotic.  The Punctuated  Equilibrium Theory casts serious doubts on Darwinian gradualism.  The Tangled Tree or Lateral Gene Transfer Theory casts serious doubts on the  idea of Tree of life and splitting (speciation) that require only 
vertical gene transfer which is based on pure lineages/common ancestry. 
 The Convergent Evolution Theory casts serious doubts on common 
ancestry.  With all these problems, how can it be considered a fact?  
Why not mention all these scientific theories in the books of evolution?
  Why are these theories not presented as counter-theories? Why is 
evolution advertised as ""the only theory"" or as an “undeniable fact"" 
when above theories have challenged many aspects of it? If evolutionists
 don't tell us about such counter-theories, they're making evolution

"Curtis Beam Yes speciation has been observed through fruit flies, London mosquitos and ring species. Just because you dont understand evolution doesnt change that they were no longer able to interbreed. You are expecting a big change where there is none. All new species come from existing species, gradually. A moth becoming a bird is not gradual. Do you know anything about artificial selection? How do you think all these breeds of dogs got here? Nature gives variation and humans or enviornmental pressures selects. All these breeds of dogs came from around 10,000 to 20,000 years of selective breeding, if you dont think bigger changes can happen in millions of years thats just a failure of your imagination. Do you think grizzly bears and polar bears are the same species? What about lions, leopards, tigers, and jaguars? The similarities within groups are a direct result of their common ancestry. For example, all mammals give birth to live young, have fur, nipples, warm blooded and take care of their young, why? Because all mammals descended a comman ancestor that shared all those traits. If all tetrapods share a common ansector, we should expect to see the same  basic anatomy, and thats exactly what we see, same basic bone structures reshaped, check out comparative anatomy. Also dont say their arent any transitional fossils because there are a lot, you just have to look. Check out whale evolution and horse evolution too",1

"    There is no ""if"". He DID write it.


<Positive claims require positive evidence. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and claims asserted without evidence may be dismissed without evidence.

 He told 40 men who trusted in Him what to write, and they wrote it in their styles while keeping the meaning intact.

 Some of what they wrote, they didn't have to be told much, as they were WITNESSES to what they were writing about.


<Oh like ""Noah's Flood""? The most absurd pile of crap in the bible.
1. The most common date given for the flood is 4400 years ago, right in the middle of the Egyptians first burst of city and temple building, why did they not notice they were under water?
 2. To flood the planet to over top the highest mountain you would need about 3 to 4 times the known amount of water in the world, where did all that water come from? 
3. After the flood, where did the water go? 
4. How did 8 people build a wooden ship bigger than any wooden ship built in modern times when THAT ship was reinforced with steel bracing and still broke up and sank. 
5. How did animals with odd diets get to the ark? 
6. How did 8 people deal with the needs of 10000 animals on the ark? Each animal had to be fed, watered, exercised and the poop scooped. Working 12 hours a day they would need to deal with over 100 animals per hour. 
7. How did the animals get back to the four corners of the world when all plant life had been killed off by the flood? 
8. If there were 10000 animals on the ark representing about 4000 species, and there is now about 8.7 million species on Earth, each species surviving the flood would have to generate 217 new species in the 4400 years since the flood.
9. Well according to the Book of Jasher, the wives ARE sisters. Jasher 5: 32-35 ""And thou shalt choose for thy sons three maidens, from the daughters of men, and they shall be wives to thy sons. And Noah rose up, and he made the ark, in the place where God had commanded him, and Noah did as God had ordered him. In his five hundred and ninety-fifth year Noah commenced to make the ark, and he made the ark in five years, as the Lord had commanded. Then Noah took the three daughters of Eliakim, son of Methuselah, for wives for his sons, as the Lord had commanded Noah."" If a species undergoes a population bottleneck, the lack of genetic diversity can be seen in the members of that species. NO such bottle neck exists in the overwhelming majority of species. 
10. 4400 years is not a long enough time to generate the diversity in the human population to give rise to the different populations of people we see on the planet especially when you consider that effectively the genetic diversity was limited to 4 people, Noah and his wife and Eliakim and his wife. 
11. Ken Ham's phony Ark has a million Dollar + heating, ventilation and air conditioning system that ensures that workers and visitors do not suffocate in the building. According to the bible, the original Ark had one window, 18 in square. Sorry people but if Ham's estimate of 1600 species represented by a minimum of 4000 animals, they would have suffocated.




~ Those who claim The Bible has contradictions simply need help reading/interpreting it.


<BULLSHIT. 
Matthew 27:5–8 5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. 6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.” 7 So they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers. 8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood ito this day. 
Acts 1:18–19 18 (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)

what religion and what about this knocked you off it?,1
"Learning math and science made me more religious. If you look beyond the fantasy of religion there is deep meaning. Another thing that people like Isaac Newton found interesting about religion is how math is seemingly encoded. I dont know how much it shows in his most famous work but newton spent way more time trying to decipher the bible through math than worry about planets orbiting. Btw, it would make sense for the bible to have math encoded. Before writing and literacy the only way information could be passed is orally, through drawings, and through structures that were built with information about their culture encoded in the form of statues, and possibly information encoded in the dimensions of the thing. Early mathematical thinking didnt have the hindu-arabic numeral system so even great greek mathematicians would be puzzled if you showed him simple arithmetic without any explanation. What if knowledge of mathematics or other stuff is encoded in the ancient stories that are todays religions predescessors? What if too many monkey humans are too dumb to even read it, where does it mention that an anglosaxon with dove wings is what an angel is? Most so called christians are not familiar with the bible, preachers exist to decipher it for the average monkey but while many preachers are good people who understand and have good intent, corruption leaks into everything humans touch. 

The tl;dr is this - religions arent inherently stupid, people are inherently stupid. The bible might have information encoded in it that we dont have the cultural tools to decipher, and it contains tons of information encoded as literal stories that should be decoded as metaphorical via dilligent use of relevant cultural context.",1

"I have no education in this what so ever. But i still have some thought about one thing that have been said on this course.
Its that evolution happen slowly and gradually, and i believe so too.
But as so often, it is not either this or that and nothing in between..
If it for example comes to animals with a big population spread across a big are, then it is of course naturally that evolution goes slow.
But if you have a small isolated group of animals, then i have no problem to see how evolution can go in steps, where some changes happen relatively fast.

But i am aware that with no education in this, it is easy to kind of make it more simple then it is, so i don`t know anything and can only guess.
Still again and again historically we have seen scientist argue with each other over things, and very often it turns out that a combination of what both say is often more correct then what any of them alone say.

This is a joke, but i must ask anyway.
Is it mandatory among the different branch of science to first of all learn that your science is the only serious science?

"""Genes aren't all that, what's really important is the environmental regulation of these genes""

- This crap. Okay, so a raccoon can become a human with a proper environment?

If not, then what is this guy saying? Is he saying 100% of all differences between all individual humans are down to environmental effects? 90%? 80%?

Or is he just saying that differences between big groups of humans (don't dare call them races) are 99.999% down to environment? Individuals can differ in the hard code, groups of individuals can differ, but if the groups correspond with the classical races, then the hard code cannot differ in anything but that which is labeled by people today as ""unimportant"", things like skin color.

The silly thing is that epigenetic effects are ALREADY CAPTURED in old heritability estimates. They're just put in the bucket labeled ""environmentality"".

It's interesting to learn about the mechanisms by which environmentality occurs, but this guy heavily implies that this mechanism increases the importance of environment above what was previously considered.",1
"Fringe Elements ""but the differences between individuals in a given place and time can still be, say, 90% explained by genetic differences.""

If that's the premise of your argument, then I'd like to know where you got that ""fact"" from. If you retort to me, saying ""oh, it's something like that, that's roughly it, quit being anal for the sake of argument"", I will quite promptly conclude that you are pulling that statistic only from your gut feeling and not out of any modern, scientific evidence base.


You mention in your original comment that you are confused if he's referring to environment accounting for ""100%, 90%, or 80% [of individual differences between humans]"". He's not saying any of that. What he is saying is that modern evidence refutes the premise of your argument that I was referring to. He's saying that there is a much larger environmental component in terms of genetic expression than we previously thought. 

Precisely because ""hard code"", as you put it, does not do all the work in terms of determining what the emerging product is. The ""hard code"" only makes up 5% of our genes, and yes it is static. However, 95% of genes determine which of this ""hard code"" is activated and when it is activated, and it determines this based on internal factors, such as the level of testosterone in the blood system, or even environmental factors. Meaning that it is quite possible, if not probable, that a lot of our individual variances on the level of genetic-expression are determined by internal and environmental causes.


Essentially, you can no longer make the claim that all or even most individual genetic-expressions are purely genetic, because it's clear that epigenetics plays a significant role in determining those genetic-expressions too.

Did he ever go over Plasmolysis and or Cytolysis?,1
"You need to be more specific when describing  the concentration of the cell. why? because hypotonic happens when the concentration of salts in the cell is higher then the outside, so water will absorb in. An hypertonic solution is when the concentration of salts in the cell is lower than outside the cell, so water will flow out of the cell. By not describing it specifically it sounds like your explanation is completely opposite. Besides that , love your videos",1
Aren't all cytotic (cytosis?) reactions mediated by receptors?,1

"When he is explaining Hypertonic vs. Hypotonic solutions, seems like he may be mixing up the two [2:40].

But I was disappointed he did not problematize the notion of mental illness at all.  ""How many people have depression"" is predicated on diagnosis.  And the act of diagnosing a ""mental illness"" is far from neutral or ahistorical.  Certain populations—due to racism, sexism, or ethnocentrism—are more likely to receive particular diagnoses.  The very invention of some ""mental illnesses"" (such as lesbianism and hysteria) were based on those same prejudices.  And there are cultures that would not categorize the symptoms of depression as a ""mental illness"" at all: So ethnocentrism is inherent in this project.  Lastly, these diagnoses are made by licensed medical professionals.  And access or use of western medicine is clearly not equal among populations.

"Near the end of this lecture, it seems that the mother has a tremendous influence on the mother's baby.  So now, in our current society, with 'equal rights for women', and women want to work, (justifiably so), and here in the USA also might lead to how much social security benefits/retirement benefits the women might have later in life, who's raising the baby when the mother is at work?  And what traits are being passed onto the baby from the baby sitter/day care center?

Now also, what about a single mom?  Or a single dad?  Who also most probably would also have to work to support them self and their child?  Maybe even working two or more jobs and/or having travelling jobs?

And what about orphans with no mom or dad, or maybe not even any sort of real support system?  Or worse, an abusive system that they are being kept in/raised in?

And then, what about even our apparent true destiny?  Currently it appears that reality indicates that:
1. We are ALL going to die one day from something.
2. We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced.
3. We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.
(And that life itself is all ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things, at least from Earthling's perspective, but maybe even from all entities in existence in this universe's perspective?)

Is it even possibly 'better' to not have any children at all, especially since the world's population is doubling at quicker and quicker rates?  And then also, what about birth control and even abortions?

Why should people who believe in potentially fairy tales beliefs as if those fairy tale beliefs were really true, decide how other people in society should exist while they exist?  If those people want to exist that way, fine, exist that way.  But, leave 'non-believers' of those fairy tale beliefs out of having to follow those fairy tale beliefs.  In other words, if religious people can be legally exempt from some of secular societies' laws and regulations, then why can't secularists be legally exempt from any laws and regulations that religious people put in place?  Basically, a permanent separation of church and state.  Deluded people believing in their fairy tale beliefs versus possibly people trying to live in actual real truth in actual reality as best as they can discern actual realty to really be.",1

"What about the experience level and competent awareness on parents' part? Having a mentally ill parent who is successfully coping changes the outcome for their child in the same home environment, right?Severity of abnormal behaviors of mental illness that are recognizable and reported are GREATLY worsened or lessened by parents' coping skills with their own mental illness, aren't they? So a bipolar patient will exhibit more alarming behavior when the parents are also ill and not in a stabilizing treatment; a patient whose bipolar parent is actively watching for problems and understands appropriate social responses and when to seek help has a better chance of ""less dramatic"" exhibition of abnormal behaviors. Like the rat mom incident,  researchers must look at a mentally ill person's access to a role model of similar conditions.

I can make a rule to avoid my own compulsive habit and see how it goes.""",1

"I feel like we as humans, sadly, are born with a scientific notion of ""destiny"" after listening to genetics lectures. So many things about our genetic coding are determined even before we are born due to either environmental or hereditary factors. There are crazy examples in this particular lecture.
Imagine a person born with a kidney that is coded to use every bit of nutrients it receives, it will be very hard for that person to lose weight or let's say stay fit or skinny.
And this person gonna have to deal with all kinds of judgements coming from the environment about being fat. It is very likely that this person will develop insecurities due to that, think about all the opportunities that will be missed by this person because he/she was insecure this could very easily alter the course of the person's life.

"What is 'criminal behavior'? Do not throw stones at heretic, do not discriminate against different races, do not beat women, do not hate Jews - all of these were crimes. And were overcame by people whose actions were against existed laws, through 'illegal activity'.
Defending your own child against a murderer is a crime in many modern countries. You should watch silently how your child is being killed and do nothing. But if a parent would defend their child by attacking the murderer, it would be a crime.
On the other hand citizens of aggressive counties denying to kill people who did nothing bad for them are criminals too. Those who didn't want to go to Vietnam, Germans who didn't want to go kill Russians, Russians who don't approve what Russia is doing in Ukraine - they all are criminals by the law.
So, for the science sake, what is the 'criminal behavior' they studied?
It does even sound like an old 19-century idea about 'black's behavior', or 'inherited behavior of poor', or even like 20-century 'Jewish behavior'.
Laws - just random imaginary ideas of human, who know nothing about things they want to regulate. Most laws are made by people who by themselves never needed what they want to prohibit (e.g. most prohibition of painkillers were made by people who never felt strong long-lasting pain, of course they can't believe humans can feel pain so great they want to kill themselves - Tchaikovsky had such severe migraines he tried to kill himself a couple of times during them).
Therefore there are no 'criminal behavior', but just behavior, randomly approved or disapproved by those with the power, sitting on comfortable sofas and fantasizing about unrealistic imaginary worlds with 'correct' and 'incorrect' ways to live.
Hell. How anyone can call themselves a scientist and speak about 'criminal behavior' seriously!",1

"Every human being who has ever lived or will ever live has asked,is asking , or will ask four basic questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What is wrong with the world? And how what is wrong be made right? While we may not say them, it is in the soul of every person to wrestle with these questions. 
Allow me to answer these questions first from the perspective of our culture and then from the perspective of the Bible. 

Answer from our culture:
Who am I? You are an accident. You are a mistake.
You are a glorified ape. You are the result of random evolutionary process. That's it. No rhyme. No reason. No purpose. This is the pathetic reality when evolution runs its full course. If the idea is carried to its logical conclusion, human beings have no value. You are ultimately nothing. 

Why am I here? You are here to consume and enjoy. That's the only thing that matters. When the famous philanthropist John D. Rockefeller was asked, ""How much money is enough?"" He was as honest as any man has ever been. He responded, ""Just a little bit more."" Consume and enjoy-thats why you're here.

What is wrong with the world? People are either 
insuffciently educated or insuffciently governed. That's 
What's wrong with the world. People either don't know enough. Or they're not being watched enough.

How can what's wrong be made right? The solution is more education and more government. Teach people more stuff and give them more information. How do we combat AIDS? Through AIDS awareness. How do we combat racism? Anti hate class. What about the man who beats his wife? Anger management classes. Just give people more information and everything will be fine. The answer provided by our culture leaves us waiting in empty. Let's now take a look at how God's word, the Bible, answers these questions.

Answers from the Bible Who am I? You cannot figure out who you are until you discover who Jesus Christ is. Jesus ""is the image of the invisible God.... By him all things were created... All things were created through him and for him""( Colossians 1:15 - 16). He is God With Us. God Among Us. The Bible says that I am created by God/In His Image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). Not the result of random processes. The Bible says that whether I am tall and beautiful or small and not so handsome. Whether my body functions perfectly it or is severely deformed. I am the crowning glory of the creation of God. And as a result I have inheritance of dignity, worth and value.

Why am I here? All things were created through him and for him.... That in everything he might be preeminent"" (colossians 1:16b, 18). The ultimate purpose of all things is to bring glory and honor to Jesus Christ. That's why I exist. That is why you exist. And because of this contrary to the views of our culture. The reason for my existence goes far beyond comprehension and enjoyment.

What is wrong with the world? I am. You are, despite the fact that we are the crowning glory of the creation of God. Created to live and bring glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ. We are instead hostile and disobedient towards the one by whom and for whom we were created. All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned / everyone to his own way(Isaiah 53:6). The Bible calls this disobedience sin and it says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) in short, sin is what's wrong with the world.

How can what's wrong be made right? What is wrong can only be made right by the substitutionary, atoning death of Christ. ""He [Jesus] has now reconciled[you] in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him"" (Colossians 1:22). There is no other means by which we can be made right with God. There is salvation in no one else. For there is no other name under Heaven given among us men by what we must be saved""(Acts 4:12).
The Bible says. For our sake[God] made [Jesus] to be sin who knew no sin. So that in him we might become the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21). There was nothing else that could have been done that would have allowed God to be righteousness and also the one who makes us right. In the mercy of God the father he punishes his son in our place in order to satisfy his righteous wrath against sin. Our only hope is to believe in Jesus Christ who was crucified for us and rose again (1 Corinthians 1:23 15:3-4). The simplest Lamb of God gave his life to paint a dead that he did not owe on behalf of sinners who cannot pay him back!

The ultimate answer: If those two sets of answers from our culture and from the Bible- if placed side-by-side something very interesting happens. With the answer from our culture, you are left worthless, empty and hopeless. You are on your own to pursue satisfaction... And you'll never find it. But the Bible says you are precious. You have purpose. You were purchased. The only way what is wrong in your life can be made right is for you to believe what the Bible says. Believe that Jesus took the punishment for your sins by dying on the cross as a substitute for you and that he rose from the dead three days later. Showing that God had accepted his death on the cross as a payment for sin / debt that you owe to God. If you believe this to be true, repent (completely turn from) your sinful pattern of life. And place your faith completely in Jesus Christ. God promised if you confessed with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God rose from the dead. You will be saved (Romans 10:9).

The answer to life's ultimate question is Christ. Those who walk aimlessly through what this life offers will never be satisfied with the answers our culture gives us. Christ is the only one who will ever satisfy. Have you ENTRUSTED your life to him?",1

1. Describe how water travels from the to cell to the leaf.  Map the way.
Water is transported into the roots and enters the xylem. Cohesion and Adhesion cause the water to move through the xylem. It then goes from the xylem in to the mesophyll cells and evaporates through the stomata.

2. How is ground tissue different in the root/stem the the leaf?
The ground tissues does not has chloroplast cells/mesophyll cells and does not preform photosynthesis.

3. Describe how the stomata opens and closes.
The stomata open due to the guard cells expanding and contracting. The cells expand because of water/turgur pressure. When more pressure is present the cells expand and when there is less pressure they contract and let the stomata open.",1

For now I'm going to assume this only applies to non-vascular plants or that there are several exceptions to this but he did infer that vascular plants use this. Can someone give me clarification?

Addition: I've been thinking about it some and I believe I may have clumped two cycles into one. So if the first generation is my ""plant"" and my sporophyte is the flower. The flower mates and makes the fruit which becomes my new ""plant."" My one question is how the plants mate for the first cycle. I'll assume this gets answered in next episode but if someone knows if this is right or not it would be greatly appreciated.",1

"At 7:19 he says: ""If humidity levels are high enough the capsule will let the spores go to meet their fate."" In other literature I have read that the capsule actually remains closed when humidity levels are relatively high, and it only opens up when the air is dry enough for the spores to spread far away from the mother plant by means of wind. To me, this explanation sounds more plausible. What do you think?",1
I hear that John Green wrote a few books. I think that one got tried at being banned. What were those books?,1

"***** I have a very strong interest in biology in general... I had my heart set on a career in molecular biology until an acquaintance (a professor at the school I want to go to) convinced me that bioengineering would be better for me.

Are there any organisms,  or is it theoretically possible for an organism to completely claim and integrate the cells of another organism as it's own.  Two things I think would be similar are transplants where a human body accepts the organ if a donar. Or digestion where we break things down to make energy to create structures of our own. However these aren't quite what I had in mind. 

The reason I ask is i got a great idea for a Sci Fi novel (which of course will include things that aren't necessarily possible). But if this is something that is possible. Is there a name for it,  and how would it work? Or can you point me in the right direction for research of my own?",1

I appreciate you and john and what guys are doing DFTBA,1

"Mrs. Crash course, you are so knowledgeable and entertaining  and make biology so fun and relevant to teens, and I love your videos, but unfortunately I need a rated G version of your videos. My parents would not go for your references to heavy petting and the like (and swearing in other videos). Have you thought of editing this stuff out so teachers in private schools can use your videos? They really are great; it's sad I can't use them.",1
"Because if our fist is clenched to the point where we feel we're applying force,  we are applying force. Applying force against what? Two things (at least), against the resistance of the opposing muscles and connective tissue to being stretched (their elasticity), and also against the elasticity of our palm, which we are jamming our fingers into as we clench our fist.
Usually also gravity, in some way, but in exactly what way depends on our current orientation in space. In some scenarios, I imagine it could reduce the amount of force we need to clench our fist.
Muscles produce force when they contract initially, but they produce no more force in the desired direction once they are contracted. So, how could we produce the continual force we feel when we clench our fist? It requires rapidly relaxing and contracting the muscles so as to repeatedly produce force in the desired direction. Hence, continuous(ish) use of energy.",1

I probably know more then einstein on fundamental physics, i sure don't hqve his level and am still a student in theory, but he would have more to leqrn from me then me from him.
Feynman perhaps not, he l8ved though the quantum revolution anw was just out of thid world intelligent.

Doesn't mean his principia wasn't like them most gamechangong book in hostory, and i m nowhere near his level.

The end remark explains a lot. One things I need clarification of is this: It is known that our experiences and their responses vary between individuals. What also varies is the interpretation of an experience. A simple example is that some people feel dizzy and miserable (they may even throw-up) while sitting on merry-go-round whereas other see this as a fun experience. A child may be more afraid of the same stimuli than an adult. differences in such interpretations is also caused by neurotransmitters and hormones or there is something else at work too?,1

"1:06:00 into lecture, anyone else see a bipolar junction transistor? neuron B is the emitter, Gaba receptor is base and neuron A is the collector. Neuron B can send a signal to A, but it's effects are altered by the Gaba receptor(Base-emitter control). Small changes in the voltage applied across the base–emitter terminals cause the current between the emitter and the collector to change significantly. This effect can be used to amplify the input voltage or current. BJTs can be thought of as voltage-controlled current sources, but are more simply characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base. does this make sense? peace and love",1

"Kumquatodor I'm not sure the oxygen thing is true. In mammalian lungs, Oxygen and CO2 mix internally as we're breathing, This decreases Oxygen concentration and thus makes breathing less efficient. .

In avian lungs, however, it's a one-track system. This means that the Oxygen we need and the CO2 we expel don't mix. 

At least, I believe that is how it works. I'm certainly not an authority on comparative anatomy. 

I've never heard the nerve thing though, what do you mean? Do mammals have quicker reaction times for something?",1
"Kumquatodor I'm not sure about that Kumquatodor, the Avian respiration system seems to be far more efficient than the Mammalian as Machiavelli pointed out.

Bird intelligence is also not to be snuffed at, obviously birds can't compete with Humans but Parrots and Corvids are way more intelligent than is often assumed, the New Caledonian Crow for example has amazing mental capacity for something its size and really does seem to be at the level of the higher Apes, it is the only Non-primate creature known that creates and modifies tools, often without any previous experience with the tool or the problem presented. Also worth a look is the Kea parrot. Magpies have even passed the Mirror test as well, so some also have a sense of self awareness.

Why don't you submit the step by step process of how evolution creates a new species to the peer review process?
Because, you would be the first. No such step by step explanation exists. That was true thirty five years ago, and it's still true today.
So, your argument is bogus and false.",1
"Thanks Brent. Two questions. What do you think the process is that drives adaptation within a species? And what, in your mind, would be objective evidence that would support evolution?",1
"2 Minute Classroom 
I believe the world is losing genetic information. Just like energy. It's called entropy. We will eventually reach heat death.
In other words, new genetic information is not being created. We are only losing it. I believe the adaptation we see in finches, or other species. Is nothing more than genetic information being turned on or off, depending on the environment. That being, genetic information, already programmed by the creator. Since, there is no known way for new genetic information to spontaneously generate on its own.

As for objective evidence for evolution. How about a step by step process explaining the complex features of life?
Instead of, it happens so slow we can't see it. Or, it happens so fast we missed it.",1
"How much genetics have you studied Brent? Are you familiar with DNA replication? Transcription and translation? Gregor Mednel's studies on Heredity? 

I'm curious about this notion of genetic information being turned on or off. Are you saying that you and I, as human beings, have all the exact same DNA, and that any differences in our features are due to what genetic information we each have turned on and off?

As to your last question of a step by step process to explain the complex features of life, I fully admit that there are gaps in the evolutionary timeline and that we can't account for all diversity, but that doesn't mean evolution is false. In the same way we can say the atomic theory is limited, in that it doesn't explain exactly what ll the components of an atom are made of, or exactly how they behave, or even where a given electron can be at any given time. This is true of all scientific theories.

A quick science lesson about how theories form. First, an observation is made in the natural world, which leads to the formation of questions and light research to form a hypothesis (a guess about why nature behaves in the way it does). This guess is then tested, which means a scientist try's to disprove it, not prove it. If it cannot be disproved, more research is done with regards to that hypothesis. the longer this goes on the more robust the research supporting a claim becomes (not proving it, but supporting it). Eventually some ideas gain so much credibility that they become theories. This doesn't mean that they are not wrong, but that everything we have observed so far supports them. Sometimes research will come along that pulls into question this claim or that claim about a particular theory, and so that claim may be adjusted to fit the new research, but the entire theory is not thrown out altogether unless new research comes along that can explain everything the old theory did better and more accurately. 

I know this has been a long post already, and I apologize for that, but I want to include one quote from a discussion between a prominent scientist and creationist. You can read the full dialog here. http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Lenski_dialog 

""You may be unable to understand, or unwilling to accept, that evolution occurs. And yet, life evolves! From the content on your [Posts], it is clear that you, like many others, view God as the Creator of the Universe. I respect that view. I find it baffling, however, that someone can worship God as the all-mighty Creator while, at the same time, denying even the possibility (not to mention the overwhelming evidence) that God’s Creation involved evolution. It is as though a person thinks that God must have the same limitations when it comes to creation as a person who is unable to understand, or even attempt to understand, the world in which we live. Isn’t that view insulting to God?""",1
"2 Minute Classroom 
I disagree about the, genetic entropy video, being cherry picked. The guy wrote a book on the subject! He addresses an issue that evolutionists avoid regularly. Do we have more genetic information today, or less than we have had in the past? Which is it? Are we gaining DNA, or losing it?
What should we find in nature if evolution is correct? Are we gaining species, or losing species?",1

If so,do tell.",1

Think about it son, a sky deity splitting itself in three, allowing a cemetery full of zombies to rise and many other examples of magic. Is that what you believe? I used to be a christian and indeed believed all of that. Simply because you are puzzled by  a question does not mean that you should inject a god as the  answer. Mathematics,science and many other art forms came from humans. No deity required. Can you guarantee and convincingly prove otherwise? Are  you  the chosen one to enlighten the masses with empirical evidence proving the existence of your deity? What information is available to you that is not available to me? What ya got Brent?",1

​   Eyewitnesses can be misleading. And there have been different versions of how actual living historical figures died. Even as recent as in this last century. Some of them are downright ludicrous. We cannot depend on just simply a few dozen possibly hallucinating female  eyewitnesses. And even if they did see that.So what? was the person really dead? Where the females part of a secret conspiracy to fool others?

Different gods have been used to explain things such as lightning, like Thor, Odin and Zeus. Earthquakes to deities like Poseidon and so on and so on. So what?  Floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters have all happened at different times and explained in different ways by the beliefs of those people who experienced them in their particular area. The genie from aladdin spoke to me and told me to tell you to repent. He caused all of that. How do these things prove your deity?",1

What explains animals changing from it's prehistoric counterparts into it's modern form and not changing  back? Explain it.",1
   Has evolution been disproven since it's creation? ABsolutely not. Also what is with your obsession with the word presupposition?,1
"Orca Lord   It’s the reason humans exist, really? Then why does evolution theory have no scientific application today? Why’s it completely useless and actually detrimental to scientific advances?",1
"Orca Lord    Lol. Nice fairy tale. It’s scientifically and logically fallacious. Design needs a designer, always, no exceptions. Shall we talk about the genocide directly connected to evolution theory? How about Eugenics, another pseudo science directly connected to evolution theory?",1
"   They can be used for reproduction, but they are still leg bones and finger bones, you keep ignoring this fact. Modern whales have also retained both of their nostrils, but have one blow hole. How could an super intelligent god make such a design flaw? We have fossils showing in chronological order the development of the modern day whale. The two nostrils migrating upward into what is now a blowhole can be seen and the gradual decrease of the legs is also apparent in the fossil record. Like I mentioned about this pathetic whale we the tiny sausage legs that could not have supported it's weight. If your God designed that he is Seriously one twisted person lmao!

 Of course, fossils can only do so much on their own, so multiple lines of evidence from multiple different disciplines of science come together to corroborate evolution. Genetics, for example, allows us to trace our evolutionary history in DNA and has confirmed many of these findings. Why do humans have pseudogenes for making TAILS? Why is it that we have TAILS while in our mothers wombs? Because we are products of evolution. And no I don't mean just the coccyx, I mean a continuation of 10-12 vertebrae from the coccyx, a true tail. We humans grow those while in the first couple months, but then genetic shut off switches make it degrade, except in rare cases. And no, don't bring up spinal bifida I'm not talking about that medical condition, I'm talking about true boned tails.

"I wish I didn't have to scroll this far down the page to find someone saying this. The most important part of this lecture is where he starts - by saying that Schizophrenia is actually a syndrome (a bunch of related disorders).

"Excellent lecture. It intuitively makes sense to me that if there are too many receptors for anything in the brain, it could lead to brain dis functioning. Hence too Much dopamine may be filling the receptors and preventing some dysfunctions  while creating other disorders. Since schizophrenia is a disorder and diagnosed as such, could there not be a number of different  neuro- chemical causes that give similar symptoms?",1
"Is it possible to find out if i have too few dopamine receptors, or too low levels of dopamine?",1
"   We also no longer have to be face to face when talking to someone. For all of human existence, we HAD to be face to face with the person we wanted to talk to. There are now kids growing up in a world that's completely different from the world our bodies have adapted to for hundreds of thousands of years. The reason we don't say certain things to people's faces is because we are empathetic beings. Making someone feel bad makes US feel bad.... unless we communicate with people who we cannot actually see or hear. How many times have you heard someone say: ""Relax it's just Facebook it's not like it's real"".  When we aren't able to pick up on social cues and body language we tend to see the person that we are talking to, as nothing but text on a phone. This in turn makes it much easier to disconnect with and even dehumanize other people. It just takes a quick scroll through the comments section to see it's already happening. I don't see why modern life is seen as so prosperous and advanced. Sure we have more complex tools and we can understand complex concepts. How can someone be poor if money doesn't exist? Trust me there's PLENTY of resources out there capable of providing everyone with basic human needs. The greedy minority (1%) like to hoard it all, not to use, but to gain power over people who's lives who depend on those resources. Why should one single person be the  of resources that could be used to enrich other peoples lives?",1

"WHERE IS PART 2?
Anyway, I like his pieces of info on communication and the family. But this is very outdated and imperial thinking. The Western understanding of schizophrenia is dangerously broad. The list of 'symptoms' are unreliable and interchangeable. The longest (30 years) and most detailed schizophrenia research revealed that WITHOUT INTERVENTION (i.e. no brain-altering, synthetic medications) schizophrenics can stabilise, return, and continue to live a normal life, even enhanced. But WITH INTERVENTION (when subjects are given anti-psychotics), schizophrenics degrade and regress and stay in the same ""broken"" patterns for the rest of their lives.. Look to other cultures and how they see schizophrenia. It is more of a spiritual awakening than a disorder.",1

Can I ask you a question that I’ve been curious about? During your episodes, during your delusions, are you aware that it’s a delusion? It seems like you are very aware (hats off to you, sounds like it took some work on your end to get to that point). 
But during an episode or an off day, how aware of yourself and your schizophrenia are you? Are you able to think “this is my schizophrenia, I’m not going to listen?” Are you able to keep yourself from acting on your thoughts during those episodes? Does it feel like your whole thinking pattern changes so you aren’t even able to remember that you have schizophrenia? Or am I being naive to even suggest that? I am trying to understand and this question of awareness has always been the most interesting to me.",1

"I always thought my parents had a major role on my brother schizophrenia. 
He says that schizophrenia has an adolescent seton where stress plays a major precipitating role (45:55). He also said that big psychiatrists back in the 50s thought bad parenting is one of the main cause for it. But than the first real drug came out and those people have to  go back on their word, cause it was just a biochemical disorder (1:28:53). 
So what of the two?
For what I can understand the biological disorder is evident just after the disease breaks out. So it is totally possible that bad parenting can cause it (with a genetic base). So why psychiatrist of the 50s thought they were wrong when first drugs came out?",1
"once you realize that all the ""animals"" arent animals but beings just like us then more will start to make sense to you. ask yourself this question and actually understand what it means...""does a horse feel like its walking on 2 legs and 2 arms or is it 4 legs?"" once you understand what that is asking then youll understand the next set of questioning. the next set of questions can not be told to you until you understand the first part because it will never be able to make sense no matter how open you claim your mind to be.  if you only knew what babylon was like, what you see going on in our realm now would make infinitely more sense to you. people have to be willing to open their minds beyond the edge of what they believe reality to be. schizophrenia isnt what people think it is. imagine its your first day alive you dont know anything yet and someone comes and tells you to get into this car and drive to brazil from quebec. you dont know what they said or know what the car is yet. what you call Schizophrenia is really gifted they just arent taught about their gifts. either the ""doctors"" know it already and its all about control or we literally learn majority collectively and people arent able to get passed set in stone beliefs. i could talk to you for an hour and from the books teachings youd say i have schizophrenia and youd find it not easy to see unless i let you. its because its not a disability its a gift you just dont understand it. it can definitely become harmful tho if its not shown how to be used and some have the ability stronger than others. its all for reason and we need to understand it and stop labeling it all as disability. theres so much that isnt known because its just labeled as a disease so it will never be studied the proper way. i have a feeling soon people will start to see its only a matter of time before all ancient knowledge will reflood this realm",1

Could this be supported to the furthest mathematical degree of relatedness separation in humans?

"Hey; does anyone know if there relevant resources for this class can be found anywhere? I mean: the syllabus, class notes, exam templates etc Basicaly any or everything the students who attended this particular series of lectures were given?

I know this is probably a long short considering the age. I see that Stanford has a website with a handful of free online courses, but I was unable to find this one on there. I've recently begun looking through MIT OCW and was amazed to realize the thoroughness of the whole thing: they have just about every class they offer on there, for free, and it looks like many of them have the entire gambit of material; ie. they not only have the tape recorded lectures, but also have the syllabus, anything the teacher handed out... It's basically everything you would get from going to a class minus the credits (obviously) and the ability to go to class physically which clearly has some invaluable benefits.

Anyways... If anyone knows if the handouts for this class , syllabus, exams, etc are available anywhere ( or if you happen to have gone to this class and still have some or all of the relevant material at hand) it would be much appreciated. 

I just began going to community college (I'm about to turn 30 and haven't been to school regularly in a normal capacity since I was 15... I was put in state custody at that age etc)  at the beginning of the year and now that the virus is going on, I think I'm going to be taking this (fall) semester off; since we don't have ""real"" in school classes, I want to wait to take the courses which I will actually be learning something from and would like the benefit of real time feedback. In the mean time I'm taking some courses relevant to my degree ( and interests) online in the meantime... Which has brought me here.

Brilliant lecturer.",1

People love a chiselled jaw but is a butt chin jutting out really that attractive? Having a good jaw would aid everything from good breathing to proper chewing and what not but like. Chins are just there right?,1
"has it really been debunked? because in class the other day, it was said that it was unknown if chins have a function. could you provide research articles (name and authors) to back that up?  if chins are important in males, per your theory, then what is their purpose in females? 

i didn't see anything about chins in your live science link. i don't think that article backs up the claim about chins having a purpose. all it talked about was general bone structure (jaws, cheekbones, etc) getting stronger ... but that doesn't show a purpose to a chin, really. or, i'm not sold based on that article. 

(i have no opinion on whether they have a purpose or not. i have never gave it much thought. but i didn't see anything that ""debunked"" the idea that they are purposeless.)",1

But what implication does it not have for humans that we live in a society with increased social freedom while we also are in between tournament specie and pair bonding specie?,1
"Good points, though in a way, I think you might be being a bit narrow in your interpretation of what the terms ""about"" and ""competition"" should mean in the claim ""an awful lot of this world of competition really isn't about competition."". I would not think that the products of the ""world of competition"" are about competition alone, but I wouldn't imply that competition is irrelevant to the equation either. I'm sure factors like empathy and greed factor in too, and as all good thinkers would tend to conclude; it's way more complicated than that. But at least at a certain level of analysis, 'maximising the gene pool' is itself a kind of competition; it's competing to achieve an aim. Evading death is itself a competition. It seems fair to say that life is by nature a kind of competition; the struggle against nature and adversity is a competitive activity.

Regarding time, I'd suggest that although your formulation of time as an observational method seems pretty sound, it is quite reasonable for us to both perceive and talk of time in terms of a dimension, direction or place since metaphor and analogy are ways of human understanding. Competing with your past self might not be strictly possible in literal terms, but we can certainly pretend we can. Competing with your past self is a game, and time is a way to keep score of the series of games we play.

I will add that I am but an enthusiastic amateur philosopher, and certainly no expert in these matters (or at least present me isn't). I am also adverse to ideology, on the whole, so tend to be in my own personal thought bubble; few agree with those who don't take sides. I appreciate the discussion, as contrary to any suggestions, I try to think 'outside of my bucket' whenever possible; I define my own box, and decorate it in such a way that I am satisfied that it reflects my inner perspective, which is a continuously evolving process fueled by discussions like this. After all, what's the good of having a mind if you can't change it?",1

"Now that I'm thinking about this individual selection idea, I wonder how it could possibly explain eusocial species like ants and bees?  And, to some lesser degree, human behavior.  How does the eusocial behavior arise and persist against the constant pressure of these individual selection selfish genes?  Conversely, why should co-operative group selection fail when groups are clearly in competition?  If the explanation is always individual selection, then group selection must be ineffective for some reason; what is that reason?

Also, how does individual selection lead to speciation?  How do populations change their reproduction strategies when their environment changes if every individual is operating on their own?  How long does it take for a population to adapt its behavior to a new physical reality?",1

*Increased rates of female violence,  infanticide,  and false paternity.
*Dietary consumption of estrogens en masse has efemenized massive numbers of males. It was actually in the 1990s that I predicted the 'soy boy' phenomenon knowing soy contained estrogen and was a major component of fast foods which pregnant women often craved. (I'm a pharmacist)

What is the gender distribution for infanticide; because you need fewer males for reproduction and if the female infant is quickly matured then with females of other competitors the dominant male gets more mating opportunities. This would correlate to child abusive  rates in humans by new partners.  And narcissistic traits increase that way of deliberately thinking. For the primate he should go after the boys.",1

If so then there is no logical reason for the pregnant monkey to do that as it produces the same result or does that already pregnant monkey make sure the real father doesn't see the mating? Does that result in the children being safe from infanticide from both the males or are both males now willing to kill the kids as they're unsure?

Classic case of ya gets what you pay for?,1
"These lectures were fantastic until lecture 21, but after watching this one I feel like the last 3 hours could have been replaced with two very simple, concise statements.

1. There are systems with non-injective time evolution functions that are sensitive to variations in initial conditions.
2. Such systems are common in biology.

Sapolsky also conflates linearity, sensitivity to initial conditions (chaotic), and time-reversibility.  He claims that the three are equivalent when in fact there are evolution functions for every yes/no combination of those three properties (except that there are no linear chaotic maps).  

Some examples:

time-irreversible but linear and non-chaotic:
y[n+1] = 1

time-reversible and non-chaotic but non-linear:
y[n+1] = y[n] ^ 2

What are the true relationships between complexity and the properties he mentions?  Far from all three being equivalent, the only general relationship I can think of is that noninearity is a necessary condition for chaos. 

Additionally, these two lectures complete misrepresent how reductionist science deals with uncertainty.  Variations in data are not simply considered ""measurement error"".  Almost all modern scientists use Bayesian inference to reason under uncertainty.  Models are built around our lack of knowledge about the physical systems they represent, including measurement errors and unknown details.  To use body temperature as an example, a reductionist model need not attribute temperature variations to lack of thermometer quality.  Instead, the variations are expected because our model considers ""body temperature"" to be a probability distribution with expectation equal to 98.6, but with a variance on the order of 1-2 degrees (so 99.6 would not be impossible).  

That being said, chaotic behavior is a huge problem for Bayesian inference. When probability mass is spread around in unpredictable and analytically unassailable ways, our simple probabilistic models fail.  However, that does not mean that reductionist approaches are doomed.  We can empirically build models of the chaotic behavior itself!  We represent our lack of knowledge about the future evolution of a system using time evolution functions that spread probability mass around an attractor.  This is done explicitly and implicitly across all branches of science.",1

"""these are all properties of the evolution of living systems"" except the simulation itself has nothing in common with any real population of life forms. Small changes by mutation or sexually occur but do not lead to very great differences in the population in terms of the family they belong to. That is lifeforms reproduce after their kind is a clear observation. Also only a few critical mutations lead to extinction and most are non-lethal even though they slowly degrade the genome. Family groups are extremely robust at maintaining their distinct family features consistent with observed stasis over long periods of time.

Also there is the mathematical problem of too few beneficial mutations;
SIR FRED HOYLE Falsified Evolution:
1-	Fred Hoyle FRS (24 June 1915 – 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and also an atheist
2-	In 1987 he wrote ‘Mathematics of Evolution’ concluding the Darwinian theory is false (accepted micro-evolution or adaptation)
3-	What Hoyle showed was that novel genes for new proteins could not possibly have evolved by the Darwinian process of natural selection;
4-	“Well as common sense would suggest, the Darwinian theory is correct in the small but not in the large. Rabbits come from slightly different rabbits...”
5-	Even assuming 95% of the genome is junk and the code is 30% redundant could not save evolution
6-	Concerning new genes “Where they came from in the first place is a problem yet to be solved, like much else of a cosmic scale.”
7-	In 2018 TB. Fowler reviewed Hoyle's Critique of Neo-Darwinian Theory and said “The conclusion is that while Hoyle's mathematics is impeccable, and thus his critique based on them has merit, he did not carry his own reasoning far enough and specifically failed to consider the possibility of large variations in selective value.”
8-	Hoyle did not consider large variations because he knew the obvious negative effect on probability of beneficial change only magnifies the problem; Hoyle
9-	“we have a case in histone-4 where more than 200 base pairs are conserved across the whole of biology? The problem for the neo-Darwinian theory is to explain how the one particular arrangement came to be discovered in the first place. Evidently not by a random process"" The probability = 1e-120 ?
10-	Hoyle was so convinced he invented a panspermia model pushing the problem of new genes out into the cosmos admitting  it’s still a problem
11-	Since Hoyle’s work was verified and its only alternative worse for evolution of new genes his assertion that the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution is wrong is a falsification!

Look at it, not from the perspective of the individual piece of technology but from the perspective of the whole with an infinite timeline. Unless you believe god did it, in which case I can't talk to you (see Sapolsky's lecture on religion as disease), any given piece of technology is the result of a host of random events starting with the first molecules organizing in the primordial soup and ending with (in the case of the i-Phone) Steve Job's LSD altered sensorium imagining a device that would allow the user to communicate and have access to massive quantities of data. To demonstrate how random that endpoint is, without communication networks, data storage centers, underpaid corporate slaves writing code in sterile corporate work centers, children working 15hr days mining minerals that go into microchips, you get the picture............ We as human beings crave order and control. What if any order we are able to create is only possible because of random events in our minds that societies are able to manipulate by exposing populations to specific stimuli? What if there really is no free will? 

To be very clear, I am not claiming to know the answer, and I would be extremely sceptical of anyone who said they did know the answer. All of the evidence is starting to point in the direction of a collection of random events that we, needing order, try to make into a logical series of carefully planned and executed steps conducted by an 'intelligent agency' so that reality as we experience it can make sense to individuals, and can fit neatly into a cultural/societal structures like Abrahamic religion, nation states, exploitation, etc.",1

I can't thank you enough for these videos. They permit me to have some concept of what is going on when i get into scientific explanations of these topics. I may not understand the detail, but I understand the general concept... thanks to your videos. Please, please, please keep on developing videos like this. How can I support your efforts?",1
who else is watching this cuz they have a biology test tmrw,1

why do these cartoon amoebas make me feel so confident,1
Hello Amoeba Sisters thank you so much for this cute explanation. Help me to understand better. My question is are you still doing this postings ? If yes let me know it . If  not much then I would like to encourage you do it more if you have a time oh course :) May God bless you :),1

"Have you ever wondered how dna result in a trait? For example the eye color, yes your dna has the genetic information that codes for the color of your eyes. Your eye color is based on pigment that is inside the eye, but in order to have that pigment you have genes which are portions of dna.  Which can code for proteins which help make that pigment in your eyes. So we're going to talk about how your dna can be used to the making of a protein",1

"Confused me a bit too, it's because in mitosis, the sister chromotids (the duplicates) are split, resulting in homologous chromosomes in the final cells, in meiosis it's the homologous chromosomes which are split resulting in 2 sister chromotids in the cells instead.

"CrashCourse I have a question re: meiosis.  What's really tripping me up is:
1.  at 2:29 you show homologous chromosome pairs.  There are only 22 pairs (44 chromosomes).  Is this found in all body cells with the 23 pair being the sex chromosome?  Or is this found in the specialized cells that make sperm and egg cells (spermatocytes/oocytes)?
2.  (Based on your answer to question 1, if yes to the first part of the question) Is the missing pair from the homologous chromosome pairs, the 23rd and 24th chromosome which codes for sex cells the ""XX"" (women) and the ""XY"" (men)?
3.  (Based on your answer to question 1, if yes to the second part of the question) Is the missing pair from the homologous chromosome pairs, the 23rd and 24th chromosome which codes for sex cells the ""XX"" (women) and the ""XY"" (men)?

4.  Does meiosis only occur on the 23rd and 24th chromosomes of the specialized spermatocytes and oocytes?",1
"Great video, thanks! But aren't X et Y chromosomes able to match with their telomeres sequence (and synaptomenal complex) during zygotene?",1
You would make a great Dr. Who.,1
Do you have any videos more in depth after the meiosis process takes place about oogenesis and spermatogenesis? I have spermatogenesis and that whole process down but oogenesis is more complicated to me for some reason.,1
"Does the Crossover (recombination) happen only to sets of tRNA (Aminoacids) or to single nucleotides?
Or, as you mentioned actual features, like hair color and body odor, does it actually affect bigger parts of the DNA? And if so, ist the size or the ""swaped"" segment always the same or different for each function and trait?",1

Hey! So i have Biology II as a cource on my school and we've learned that mitosis and meiosis have 5 phases profase-prometaphase-metaphase-anaphase-telophase (and also pro II - prometa II - meta II - ana II - telo II in meiosis). Our book and wikipedia also says this. Is this just unique for Norway or what? What's the deal? I think u have included prometaphase in the prophase here but uh...ye...,1

Got a test on this in 2 days.  Any ideas for studying?,1
"At the end of telophase one, he says that the chromosomes fray out into chromatin. Then immediately after, he says that the product of this first phase are 2 haploid cells that contain chromosomes that are still connected by a centromere and resemble x-shapes. But how could they still resemble x shapes if they de-condensed into chromatin ????",1
Between telophase 1 and prophase 2 does the centromere will be attached or detached?,1
"In prophase 2, how are there 2 centromeres in each new cell?  There were 2 in the original cell and they split up, so shouldn’t there be one per new cell?",1

Bruh why cant i wrap my head around meiosis and mitosis,1
"Why is it that in meiosis, after the first round of divisions, the tetrads become 23 pairs of chromosomes are still called haploids? I thought haploids had to be half of whatever was in the diploid cells (23 pairs of chromosomes). ",1
What is the specialized diploid cell that starts of the process for meiosis?,1
"I'm not sure if I missed this in the video, or if I haven't watched the video where this is addressed yet, or maybe it wasn't addressed, but how does the single diploid cell that fertilization creates, and eventually turns into a human, start making the sex cells? Do some cells just decide to start preforming meiosis instead of mitosis, or does one random cell accidentally do mitosis wrong,  or maybe something entirely different? I mean, women are born with all of their eggs already made, so how does that one little fertilized egg turn into a bunch of diploid cells and a little section of haploid cells?",1
"Had a small question 
During Metaphase 1 how many number of chromosomes are brought about to each centrosome(microtubules)",1
"Wait but How do you get Homologous crossover at Prophase 1 if the cell can't possibly have Homologous pairs from both the Mother and the Father yet; like Meiosis doesn't happen in a zygote but just in a germline cell right?

Or do you mean the 2 of a single pair of chromosomes, obtained by the the parents of the individual who's cell is going through Meiosis, cross over after cloning themselves into Double chromosomes?

I feel like I answered my own question But it would help if there was some corroboration.",1
why is 9:20 not prophase and is propahse,1
How do homologous pairs separate during anaphase I? (According to what?) I mean do they just randomly get distributed among poles?,1
"I have a quiz tomorrow and a test the next day for this, is there anyone I can study with????????",1
"8:45 Surely if the cells have 23 double chromosomes they are diploid cells, not haploid?",1
Why is this video so funny I can't stop laughing at 3:06 LMAO 😂,1
"So paired genes can become unpaired, right?",1
Wait.  You said that the chromosomes swap genes from dad and mum chromosomes then later in the video you say that in the eggs there is differentiation found separate from the sperm.  So what is it then? Meiosis before fertilisation or after?,1
"I am a bit confused. 
My notes say that in meiosis the chromosomes are tetravalent. Why  not two like mitosis?",1
Does recombination occurs again in Meiosis II?,1
What happens to ploidy level at Anaphase I of meiosis I??,1

?
thanks!",1
"After telophase I and cytokinesis, do the cells undergo interphase again before going into Prophase II?",1
"One thing I don't understand is how the chromosomes are halved after the first phase of meiosis? If the chromosomes didn't replicate themselves in the interphase, it'd make sense, but they did replicate. So surely each of the new cells is still going to have the same number of chromosomes, the DNA is just goin to be mixed up a bit?",1
"One question I have is since haploid cells only have half the genetic code, at one point they came from a complete cell of some kind with a full set of genes. So what kind of cell was it? Skin cell, kidney cell, some weird type specially made to divide into haploid cells?",1

wait does what genes you have depend on the gamble of which sperm gets to the egg first?,1
anybody for sat 2 biology in 2 days??,1
can someone explain how if meiosis is to create sperm and egg cells before the fertilization then how can the crossing over have one from the mom and one from the dad,1
can you teach my biology class lol might actually be able to stay awake then,1
What kind of phase is 'Propahse II?',1
Who else is cramming for their bio final?,1
At 8:40 he says two haploids are produced but how can that be when there are pairs of 23 chromosomes. Would that not make it diploid?,1
Is interphase only before Meiosis I? I understand that it only happens once but I'm confused on which phase of Meiosis it occurs before 1 or 2? Please explain,1
oh my gosh they're brothers how did i never know this,1
"Question: Before replication, the cell contains 46 chromosomes or 23 pairs. Following replication of the DNA in S phase, the cell then contains 46 chromosomes, or 92 individual chromatids? is that correct?",1
can you please explain the fate of cells that are produced by mitosis and meiosis in humans? thanks,1
"Can anyone tell me how is it possibe, that by combining two haploid (23) cells you get one diploid(46), then the DNA replicate, so its 92, then in miosis I it's seperated into two cells and John says it's haploid? How can it be? And if it was, after meiosis II it couldn't be haploid again no? Because there is no replication before meiosis II..",1
I don't understand. Does recombination only occurs by females? because there where no dots by the XY only by the XX,1
"+Jonathan Musemeche Oh ok, so G1 and G2 are present in both stages, but S phase is only present in Meiosis I because of DNA replication is taking place. Correct?",1
How come in mitosis there's not double chromosomes in Prophase 1? Do these chromosomes just line up singly instead? :),1
Is it me or is it the fact that I was looking at john and he wasnt blinking,1

"ok im a little confused.  at 5:32 he says that the chromosomes are one from your mother and one from your father, but in the end, he says that whatever the cell and chromosomes did just happened in one sperm/egg cell ?? can somebody help please",1
"#13 - Meiosis: Where the Sex Starts

1. Somatic cells clone themselves through the process of mitosis
2. When two things aren't identical but have the ""same relation"" they're called homologous 
3. Cells that have half of a full set of chromosomes are called haploid
4. When a specialized diploid cell splits in half twice, the process is called meiosis
5. During interphase I, the cell undergoes DNA Replication (long strings of DNA begin to duplicate)
6. In which phase do crossover and homologous recombination occur? Meiosis 1
7. Which pair of chromosomes does not always go through crossover or recombination? 23rd pair (sex chromosomes)
8. The X and Y chromosomes do not match up because they are not homologous
9. The pairs of homologous chromosomes line up during metaphase 1
10. The homologous pairs get pulled apart and migrate to either end of the cell during anaphase 1
11. The result of meiosis phase I is 2 haploid cells 
12. In prophase II the process is exactly the same as mitosis, except that there is no DNA replication
13. During telophase II, the chromosomes uncoil into chromatin
14. The result of meiosis phase II is 4 haploid cells (23 chromosomes each)
15. The sex-determining chromosome comes from a sperm and egg
16. During egg production, one gamete is much larger. The smaller cells are called polar bodies

ps.... idk about number 15",1
Is this channel American? I'm British and have learnt Centromere not centrosome and Spindlefibres not microtubules. But still really helpful!!!!!,1
What I still don't get about meiosis is how they become hapnoid cells after meiosis I... wouldn't splitting a hapnoid in half again make it 1/4 of the chromosomes needed?,1
Lol anyone else doing last minute revision for AS1 tomorrow?,1
Can someone summarize the differences of meiosis and mitosis? I'm new to this....,1
"Ok. In the end of the first cytokinesis there are two cells each with 23n. How can there be 4 cells with the same amount of genetic information in the end if meiosis, when there has been no replication before prophase 2?",1
"when will schools learn that people learn things a lot quicker with this kind of method rather than just giving you a book and say ""read this and take this exam tomorrow""",1
Wait: meiosis happen to make haploid gametes and  till now sperm have not met egg then how can recombination happen in prophase 1,1
Advanced Biology where you at??,1
can someone explain how the sister chromatids become single strand chromosomes at the end and how after fertilization instead of having two single strand chromosomes we have 2 double strand chromosomes? I would greatly appreciate the help,1
Wait Meiosis occurs in male and female sex cells before fertilization happens right?  But you said parent dna come together Im confused.  When does meiosis occur again?,1
who is richer john or him,1
"Wait, so do these chromatoids just randomly pick which traits we will and won't have? Is it random?",1
but what are the 4 haploid cells that result in the end used at?,1
Wait so a double chromatid is the complete x structure and a single chromatid is half of that x?,1
"what? I cant believe that after this whole amazing unbelievable explanation he said ""its no miracle its science""! science only shows us wat happens. it cannot tell us WHY and that's because we don't know y. like if ur sure like me is indeed a miracle",1
why is there a need of meosis 2 if v already get haploid cells in meosis 1?,1
Did John just have to stay there and stand for this video?,1
"In this, after meiosis 1, you said there were 2 HAPLOID cells, but aren't these cells diploid?",1
I'm here for the A. did anyone find it,1
Did anybody else see the tpo on Prophase 2,1
". I understand that the sperm and egg are two haploids that come together. Each has 23 chromosomes. However when i look at diagrams for meosis i only see 2 chromosomes at the start that are then duplicated during interphase. So my first question is, in real life, would i see 46 chromosomes in total when the sperm and egg meet up? Furthermore, at the end of meosis we end up with 4 cells each containing a different chromosome from the other cell. How does this lead to creating a baby?",1
why does john green look like he could be  robert pattinson's older self cries,1
Can anybody easily explain independent assortment to me. I just dont get it,1
where was dave green?,1
Help so we have 23 pairs and 46 chromosomes so in interphase we double so how many chromits we have ?,1
What is the difference between sets of chromosomes and pairs of chromosomes? My professor said that we need to know and understand that......and well I don't.,1
how does hank stand for 12 or more minutes?,1
so does my science teacher,1
8:44 Floating white thing on the left side. What is it?!?,1
Omg is that John Green??????,1
Where is the Chiasmata?,1
WHY IS THIS IN MY TEACHERS PLAYLIST???????????,1
Wait crash course and John green aren't the same person...?,1
why is it important for homologous chromosomes to pair during Meiosis but not desirable for them to pair for mitosis?,1
Wait why does the diploid cell divide into 4,1
why cant the sperm and eggs be diploid if they get to be diploid after interphase anyway?,1
Is it a sex cell?,1
Is it Hanks Hair?,1
Is it a wild dust bunny?,1

What happens to polar bodies in humans/ animals?,1
Hank did you just diss John's puff!?!?!?!,1
Anyone else from Mrs. metruks AP class ?,1
Is that beanie.... from firefly???,1
Does anyone understand why he starts talking about crossover between mother and father cells? Isnt meiosis just the process of a persons own genes crossing over to form their own unique sex cells?,1
Is that John Green?????,1
same? like what the heck? its like i come back to this every year. ITS LITERALLY IN ALL OF THE TEXTBOOKS bddkdbskdn,1
what about twins???,1
Wait what did you say?,1
"When your Biology teacher is completely useless, so you have to rely on this channel instead. Anyone who can relate?",1
And what happens after that?,1
how do you go from 2 haploid cells to 4 haploid cells without DNA replication,1
Does John ever blink?,1
"When you have first one strand, then make an X with two strands joined at the center, why is the cell still considered 2N, instead of 4N? Why is a single strand considered a chromosome but when it's in an X it is called a chromatid?",1
what does ovaries or testes depend on?,1
why are you not a teacher... you would be great...if you do...please go to spring hill middle school :P,1
Charles Corby are you being serious or not,1
Does anyone know when crossing over occurs?,1
Actually where do sperms and eggs come from?!,1
Who else’s school is closed for the rest of the year??,1
"Why do you call the identical twins daughter cells""?",1
so meiosis is to create your sperm and egg right? and then meiosis ii occurs after fertilisation and then create yours and your partners child?,1
I just realized Hank and John are different people... anyone else?,1
"How can the two chromosomes in crossover be from mother and father if they are from one parent's cells? Like if the mother's normal somatic cells are going through meiosis, then how can the homologous pair of chromosomes be from the mother and the father? What.",1
"If the cell starts with 46 chromosomes then divides twice, I don't understand how it ends in 23 chromosomes??",1
So all variety comes only from the X Chromosome?,1
"But what if, improbable I don't doubt but not impossible I don't think; what if both chromosomes that are tangled and undergoing crossover, what if all the genes that cross over are the same? wouldn't the two resulting chromosomes be identical? 

I know the likelihood of that happening is stupidly small, but can it happen?",1
1:36 why does he turn into an Irishman,1
Emmmmm...is that John Green?,1
"Whyin the 23rd chromosome of man, the colour is pure while in female the colour is mixed?",1
Who has an exam tomorrow ?,1
Doctor Who and Assassin's Creed comments? Insta-nerd crush. Thank you for these videos!,1
Wait they are different people.......?,1
"In cross over why he says that its one from the mother and one from the father, doesnt this happens in the male to make sperms and in the female to make eggs?",1
Did he mention Assassins Creed because of all the genetics stuff,1
Mr. Powell why would you do this to us.,1
Who's watching this the night before the test,1
Ok but where did the first human/animal come from if it had no parents?,1
who else has the keystones,1
Am I the only one who kinda has a crush on this dude? The more I learn from him the more he's growing on me lol,1
question. So we all start as one cell. That one cell turns into trillions of cells. Isn't that defying the law of conservation of matter?,1
ok but how am i gonna pass this test tomorrow both my parents r dumb and i got dumb genes,1
Who's watching at midnight ready for biology exam tomorrow?,1

but how do we know this isn't just a conspiracy theory?,1
Trash puff? that is so mean I would take offense to that if anyone described my hair like that,1
"Is the name for that seriously ""cleavage""  XD 8:32",1
Who else has got an exam on this in the next 24 hours ??,1

It's like my boyfriend's sperm is reproducing with my DNA. What am I missing?",1
"Oh, thanks :) .... But can a person's DNA be removed and be transferred to a surrogate mother of the same species, whose ovary is stripped of genetic material, and by doing all that stuff can we get a clone?",1
"Haresh Kumararajah
Good point. Ya then we would need very tiny calipers..

Can humans be made only by the fusion of sperm and ovary? Is there any other way?",1
"But how would the nucleus of a somatic cell be taken out, do you know of any methods to do that?",1
"+H. H so i only have half of my mum's and half if my dad's dna in the somatic cells, are the somatic cells the cells the oocytes and spermocytes? all other cells have only... uhm... my dna, is that right?",1
"+Maya Tharian and also the dna of my parents is only hanging around tgere to eventually create egg cells and new a genetic cide, tgey are never used to code anything else, like some protein or trade that would get expressed in my body because my own unique dna is responsible for that?",1

"Guts Likes It In The Ass so it is by chance that this is the only planet, in our solar system, that is tailored to support life? what about the variety of vegetation. What about the animals - the flying, those in water and on land? When and how did they say my environment doesn't allow me to stay on the ground so Imma create wings and fly?

Lets not forget humans (aside from them ruining the earth) their internal complexity .is off the chain.... all by chance??... doubt it....

 its by chance humans do not live off instincts but the animals do? how did evolution make that distinction??   .. Or how about we as humans have the ability to have a sense of injustice, the power to reason, analyze, pass judgment, the brain power to invent things.etc etc etc...

What about the basic senses? - touch, smell, taste, hear, see... so some bacteria, or whatever evolutionist think came to be, formulated  distinct cells  to create the areas in our brain or the parts of the body we use these senses with all on its own? or by trial and error??  umm.. doubt it.. everything is where its suppose to be.. the tongue is in the mouth, the ears are on the side of our heads, the eyeball is in the socket, the nose is in the center of the face, we have 5 fingers on each hand, not more, not less (there are exceptions, lol) the body knows how to release toxic waste without us telling...

I cant even begin to talk about speech .. the thinking process and the structure associated with the brain and the ability to learn and speak many languages/dialects could not be a product of evolution ",1

"RogueWave318 Thank you for your response to the difference btwn evolution and the big bang theory.

If you believe in the true God of the holy scriptures (both Hebrew and Greek) how could you reason that  A LOT of comets hit the earth and gave us water? How could you think comets hit this planet, carved out the huge mass we now call the moon, and it graciously orbits the earth and coincides with the tides in the water, or the tilt of the earth ALL on its own- with no direction?

If you believe in God, not Jesus, how could you think dust formed over time and gradually became the massive and magestic planets that are in our solar system?

I am not attacking your beliefs, I just would like to know how you could have read the bible, have faith in God, and still think these things about how the universe and the earth came to be...

Are you serious? Could you please tell me how could you explore the entire world without clothes? Is the Earth a place where temperature is constanlty 20°C? Would you visit Antarctica without clothes? Clothes are so important for us!
A better sight would be still very useful for us, I'm sure that a better sight could save many lives. But we are still considered ""perfectly made""... the fact is that every living thing is a mix of good and bad features, face it. Why do both eagles and ostriches have wings? Because they are birds and they inherited wings from their ancestors. Why do we walk? Because we are primates and primates don't have wings. Wings are very useful, but there is an evolutionary history to consider.",1

"   Well, to begin with, death is a biological process.  In Genesis 3:3, Eve says: ""God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it [the tree] or touch it, or you will die.""  Now, as in Romans 6:23, I believe this means both spiritual death (separation from God) and biological death.  Later, in God's reprimand to Adam, this is listed among the consequences: ""You will... return to the ground, because from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return"" (Gen 3:19).  These verses would seem to suggest that if sin hadn't been introduced, death wouldn't exist.  There are also other references to sin corrupting non-human creation (i.e. biology) specifically:  Romans 8:18-23, Genesis 3:17-18, Isaiah 24:5-6, etc. 

It is also interesting how, as sin has multiplied in our world over time, the resulting degradation (biological and otherwise) is getting progressively worse.  For example, it was common for people in Genesis to live over 500 years!  Even with much technological advantage, these days, we can't do much better than 90.  Hope that was clear; I am not a theologian by any means, but I am pretty well acquainted with the Bible and Protestant doctrine.  Now for some questions of my own: Are you a Christian, if so do you believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible (specifically in regards to creation)?  If not, what do you believe about the entity you call God?",1
"Willwill 235 Hey those are very interest points, but I just have a couple questions. First, what makes you think God wants to make this world perfect? sometimes I worry we assume that without thinking about it. Finally, I’m curious, what makes you believe the Bible has been changed?",1
"Matthew Holdsworth why wouldn’t he want to make it perfect? He’s perfect. What’s the point of making imperfect beings and systems. Also what do you mean how do i know the Bible was changed? Even if you ignore how parts of it were taken out, and translated through multiple languages over its existence, you can see it in all the diff. modern translations.",1
"Willwill 235 First, I guess I am not convinced that a sovereign God is required to do anything. The “imperfection” of creation ie: evil, creates a dependence on him. And if a sovereign, loving God is real, wouldn’t a relationship with him be better than anything this world could offer. Finally, what evidence do you have that parts of the Bible has been removed? And actually we have thousands of manuscripts from the original languages (2) that can be easily translated by anyone familiar with the language. The translations never are in contradiction they only change grammar, not meaning. However, I find your assertion of imperfect beings curious — do you believe there is evil in this world?",1
"   First, I don't understand why you say ""it's way more likely that we weren't created.""  Can you explain the reasoning that led you to this claim?  


Second, I understand what you're saying about probability, however, your analogy is flawed.  There are many constants that have to be just right in this universe for life (and the universe itself) to exist.  We'll say those perfect constant values are the five 13s.  Now it is true that it is just as probable to have 13, 13, 13, 13, 13 as it is to have 45, 3, 9, 84, 72, however, all we care about are the five 13s.  Using a simple permutation calculation, you will find that it is possible to generate 9,034,502,400 different ordered combinations of 5 numbers out of 100 numbers.  Now because we have decided to use the same numbers for our constants, there will be 120 different ordered combinations that our five 13s can have.  Thus, we see that overall, there are 9,034,502,280 combinations that will not work for our constants and 120 combinations that will work.  The probability that we get the latter is definitely not equal to the probability that we get the former, in fact, we have only a .0000013% chance of getting five 13s (including all the possible orders).  The 'random' chance of getting 13, 13, 13, 13, 13 when that's the only combination that will work is pretty incredible and arguably not random at all.  


Third, you say that ""organisms evolve to work, not be perfect.""  If evolution starts with the genetic code, since when is a mutation/alteration in the genetic code a good thing, like evolution claims?  If a mistake is made in DNA transcription, translation, or replication, that leads to proteins that don't function properly, leading to cells that don't function properly, leading to organisms that don't function properly.  How do these organisms ""evolve to work"" when time only further degrades their structure?  I am not saying that evolution argues for perfection, but I don't even see how it can even argue for functionality.  Do you know of an observed case of a genetic defect actually enhancing an organism's abilities or functions?  


Fourth, I did explain how sin causes biological processes to be imperfect in a previous reply to Matthew Holdsworth.  If you are not satisfied with that explanation because it references the Bible, then I'm not sure how else to explain it; the Bible is what gives me all my knowledge on the origin and definition of sin.  I will not take the time to recall the details of biblical accuracy and validity as there are numerous sources that will do a better job of explaining anyways; I encourage you to do some research on the subject if you have not already.",1

I think it is terrible when Christians use bad argumentation so often. Although, a bad argument doesn’t demand the conclusion is incorrect, just as me saying “I like gravity, therefore there is gravity” doesn’t disprove it. It simply fails to prove it. However, on the notion you briefly touched on, how did the most basic units of matter originate? I concede that there is at least a fair argument to be made for evolution once matter is originated.

"cramming for exams?  I'm just watching out of natural curiosity to learn more so i can maybe someday answer, or have answered,  some questions I have about the beginning of life.
     *I am not a creationist and these questions are not to generate false debate. Like many others, I would simply like to know how atoms got together to become life!



1. Why did some (organic) molecules start needing other molecules for energy (food)?  
     Perhaps it started by molecule A accidentally running into another molecule, say CH4 (methane?) , which A naturally stripped off the C due to it's molecular structure and discarded      the H and retained the C which made itself bigger, which adding more C changed it's structure which changed how it reacted with different molecules, etc...I'm just making this up lol


2. Why did these molecules convert and store food molecules to use for energy (energy for what? to duplicate themselves?  Why do they duplicate themselves?)???


3.  How do these molecules  gain ""desire"" to actively seek out the food molecules it wants/needs?  Shouldn't a clump of matter just sit there and only react to whatever happens to run into it? 


4. What is the difference between a living cell and a dead cell?   there must be something missing in a dead cell that a living cell has, right? so if you reintroduce the missing item shouldn't the dead cell regain animation?  I know it depends on how it died, but assuming the simplest way of killing it without undo destruction.


5.  What generates the electricity in a Neuron (and other cells that do) ?   There must be some kind of chemical generator, or battery, inside the cell.


6.  Since we assume that chemicals self-organised to create life,  and that chemicals inherently do not have desire or thought, but are simply reactions due to structure.
     Should we not also assume that we (life) are not actually in any control, but just continuous chemical reactions dependent on our interaction with the environment (other chemicals)?
     Thus the intelligence and inventions of the human race are really just matter, which is consolidated energy,  organizing itself and the other chemicals around it without any actual concern or direction.   


7.  Does what i consider ""me"" even exist? 


8. I swear I'm not stoned! ...am I?


There has to be something different in self-animated matter that is not present in non-animated matter (once living or not).
I don't think it's just electricity or we could add just the right amount of electricity to dead matter, or other types, and make them animated.
Perhaps charged particles from the sun that got through the magnetosphere happened onto some organic molecules which gave them an extra jolt or something?  IDK!

"One simple model could be called the ""Olympic pool of spaghetti

 - two spaghetti noodles need to connect to each other. (only the dendrite of one noodle is growing toward the other, the other just wait in place for a synapse to form somewhere along its axon)
 - The bowl of spaghetti is the size of an Olympic pool.
 - The starting location of both noodle is random (anywhere on the surface)
 - The depth is also random (X, Y and Z are random)
 - The texture of the noodle is the same everywhere. (No bone or other hard structure to hold on ; think of wine plant growing on top of each other on the side of a hill)
 - The dendrite of the growing noodle act like the root of a tree. It seek the closest path  in this 3d pool, adjusting the grow rate in all direction, keeping the tip with the highest chemical gradient, destroying the other part that were proven to grow in the wrong direction.
 - Like the growing root, the noodle zigzag around harder obstacles, like other neuron, then continue to grow in the direction of highest gradient of chemical, attracted by the other neuron. Presumably, in this model the glial cells would be equivalent to the soft soil which can be pushed as the root is growing
 - As it progress and it is approaching the other, the dendrite is not distracted by the same chemical that other pair of neuron emit while they also grow their connections.

Beside the root of plants, do we know any example of living cells which make precise and complex 3d connections? Can we compare this memory process, which is modeled as neuron creating new connections in a 3d jello bowl, to the growing of early cells of the nervous system in an embryo? 

Starting from the neural tube, we now understand how some guiding cells migrate in precise locations. The first, closest to the starting point, already on guard at the correct position, start generating a gradient of chemical that attract a cluster of early neuron cells. As the group of neurons arrive at destination, the gene of the guide cell turn off,  the chemical gradient vanish, and another guide cell located further has in it's gene the instruction to turn on the generation of that chemical. The cluster of neurons then continue to grow in that direction.

Like in an orchestra with each musician able to play alone, but also synchronizing to the other by watching the gesture of the maestro, the growing embryo assemble the 3d structure by a combination of operation which sometime depend on signal from distant cells which synchronize the work and guide the shape on a scale much larger than any individual cell.

Another possible way that neuron can make arbitrary connection with any other part of the brain is that all possible physical connection are made at the beginning. The memory would actually be made by destroying specific connection.  

Below, I propose 3 mechanisms to the formation of memory which are not based on growing new connections between distant neurons.

Physical change memory
This physical removal of the synapse and the rest of the thin row of cells that attach it to the dendrite could happen on the second to minute time scale.

Positive memory
Alternatively, instead of destroying the connection, the memory could be enforced by the chemical dynamic in the synapse. Each time a pulse appear at the synapse, it could make other pulse easier by speeding up the reuptake or by introducing other neurotransmitter which would decrease the threshold needed to transmit the next pulse. (note: the word ""pulse""  is used as shorthand to action potential)

Negative memory
Yet, another variation could be that a synapse that got exercised many times become ""tired"" and less likely to transmit in the future. Memory would be acquired when a synapse decrease it chance to transmit another pulse.

"what are the implications of the frontal cortex maturing at age 25 and sending 18 year olds abroad to fight in a dusty land? it's like something feels wrong abroad putting immature people with nn immature frontal cortex in the military. oddly i have read that that there's a type of antidepressant that shouldn't be prescribed until after they're 25. i suspect most antidepressants shouldn't be prescribed until their frontal cortex matures as the frontal cortex's maturing could be altered or affected by the antidepressants.

what's important to remember is that the sodium potassium pump is not restoring the resting potential because it is too weak for it. the former concentration is caused by it but the resting potential is caused by the fact that potassium flows out,1

"The intracellular environment is only negative when considered relative to the extracellular environment.  So a neuron's resting state is at negative voltage because it is measured compared to the voltage of the outside environment.  The differences have to do with the concentrations of the ions.  There are more positive ions in the extracellular space than intracellular, so the outside is more positive than inside, hence inside being negative.  Does that make sense? ",1

"Here's what i don't understand: if each neuron only has one axon, how can information be sent to different areas? If each neuron can have multiple inputs, but only one output, their is only one way to go, like water flowing from streams into a river. But when the talk about how the brain works, there is always something about ""information going down separate paths and the pathways it takes determines the thought.""

wait...i dont get why the movement of potassium causes the balance of charge. arent they both positive? shouldnt one be negative to cause the balance?,1
"Wait, so potassium starts on the inside and sodium on the outside; then when the neuron receives a charge the inside becomes positive and the outside becomes negative because sodium rushes in; but it can't stay like that so potassium is let out; but that's opposite to how they started so they switch places AGAIN (why don't they just go straight back to how they were in the beginning)? is this right?",1

"how does the signal knows it has to go to spinal cord but not brain
",1
"This may sound completely dumb... Please explain during the restoration of action potential, instead of opening the potassium channels to let the potassium ions out then having to spend energy to pump the sodium back in.  Why doesn't it just open the sodium channels for the sodium to move back out down the concentration gradient in the first place?  Thanks in advance.",1
