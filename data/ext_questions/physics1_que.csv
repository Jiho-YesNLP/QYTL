- RPM
- Speed
- wheel Radius

From this parameter can i calculate the power ?",1
"Hi, I am busy with a personal projects.
I am busy with special gearing which allows me to use a driver gear which is 50mm in diamater that drives the follower gear which is 100mm in diameter. I have them running the same rpm. Now I just want to know if there will still be more torque on the follower gear (100mm) than there would be on the driver gear (50mm). Remember that all my tests the system is the same rpm. Does the follwer gear consume less energy as the rpm is not 2:1 as it should be for a equal system?",1
"Question, on the example at 3:30...if you increase the torque by increasing the meters in this example, your work increases. How would one go about describing where that extra work comes from. You have the same force and same angle, but a greater arc length. Is that where the extra work comes from? Same force applied over more distance?",1

"What is E=MC2 is consistent with TIME AND what is gravity. (TIME is thoroughly consistent with what is gravity ON/IN BALANCE.) WHAT IS E=MC2 is dimensionally consistent. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma.

Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). CLEAR water comes from what is THE EYE. INDEED, consider what is (essentially and necessarily) BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE !!! Lava IS orange, AND it is even blood red. The hottest flame is blue. The hottest lava is yellow. LOOK upwards, ON BALANCE, at what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky !! The orange (AND setting) Sun IS the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE !! NOW, consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE. (BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.) WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma, AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution.

WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. c squared CLEARLY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. WHAT IS GRAVITY is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked (ON BALANCE) !!! E=MC2 is consistent with/AS WHAT IS GRAVITY, AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution. Magnificent. Notice that the curvature or shape of said Moon matches that of what is THE EARTH/ground (that is, given what is a CLEAR horizon, of course.) The diameter of WHAT IS THE MOON IS about ONE QUARTER that of WHAT IS THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. Excellent !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE. Consistent WITH WHAT IS TIME, WHAT IS E=MC2 IS GRAVITY ON BALANCE. Finally, the average ocean tide is about 6 feet; AND said Sun manifests or forms at what is EYE LEVEL/BODY HEIGHT. The tidal range on the open ocean is about 3 feet. Notice, what is THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE ON BALANCE. Outstanding. Again, ON BALANCE, consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE. The BULK DENSITY of WHAT IS THE MOON is comparable to that of (volcanic) basaltic lavas on THE EARTH/ground. The surface of WHAT IS THE MOON is chiefly composed of pumice. Excellent. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE), AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma.

Problem: Smokestack scrubber removes undesirable particles by first adding some excess electrons and then using electric forces to pull the particles out of the air. Consider a soot particle of mass 𝑚𝑠𝑜𝑜𝑡 = 1.0 𝑥 10−12 𝑘𝑔 that travels upward in a smokestack and a charge of 𝑞𝑠𝑜𝑜𝑡 = 1.1 𝑥 10−17𝐶. Assume the electric field in the scrubber is produced by two parallel, square plates of width 𝐿 = 1.0 𝑚 and separation 𝑑 = 0.010 𝑚, with charges ±𝑄.   What must be the value of the electric field between the plates so that the force on the soot particle is equal to the weight of the particle? (A real scrubber would use a collection of many pairs of such plates in parallel)  What charge Q on the scrubber’s plates is required to produce the electric field in part (a)?

Who understood the stranger things Reference in the start?,1
"I guess my intuition for this must be completely upside-down. Shouldn't the ammeter connected in parallel get less current than if it were connected in series? Like if it's in series, it gets the whole current. If it's in parallel, it could potentially carry a lot of the current, but it would still be less than than the full current?

"Im a bit confused because even though I know that current flows from high potential to low potential, it’s still, if you look at the battery pole, always flowing from the minus pole to the plus pole. 
Which makes it a bit confusing when they say in the video that the current flows from + to -. Thats correct in the meaning that it goes from where there is alot to the side where there is a little but not in the meaning of battery flows direction. Cant we fix this in he system somehow?
This is a very good video though, I finally got the meaning of this law. Thanx alot!",1

I can't figure out how decreasing the volume would cause the gas to cool. It seems to me like if anything, doing that would actually cause the molecules to move even faster, although to an imperceptible amount. And after all, as she said, we're doing work on the system, so unless there's an exit for heat, wouldn't the internal energy increase? Would pushing the piston down not just raise the pressure of the gas in an inverse ratio to keep the left-hand side of the equation of equal value?",1

"Laff700 you could say that is the inverse. but how about crystals ? they are fruit of entropy. technically when they form they have less entropy than the space around it, but it is formed naturally when the gas or whatever try to go to a less energy state. so is it order or disorder ? the comparison doesn't make sense",1
"so what is more ordered in a closed system? a cloud of hydrogen/helium plasma or a block of iron with every atom with the exactly same energy ?
with the order/disorder logic, the block of iron is more disordered... see ? it doesn't make any sense. order/disorder is a human concept with values attributed by our own experiences, we can't apply that to a physical system to explain entropy, it just gives a completely wrong idea about how it works and what it is",1
"Frank Schneider I love how you are explaining entropy... but again, it has nothing to do with order or disorder. again, the idea of order and disorder don't make any sense as its a human construct.
I can say that perfect equilibrium, the heat death, is a perfectly ordered system. just like when you sum all the possible combinations of waves in a string, you will get a flat line. so... 
by your point of view, if I pick n numbers from 1 to 10000 in any order, the likelihood for me to pick them in ascending order (what you would call a ordered system) is smaller than picking the number in any other order, but so is any specific combination, every number has the same likelihood or being picked at any given time, it just happen that the combinations we consider ""disordered"" compose a bigger portion of the possibilities, so its more likely that I'll pick them in such a order... but again, I can find any pattern from any sequence of numbers I'm given, and then I can say that the quantity of sequences of numbers I can pick with discernible patterns is bigger than those without any discernible order, it all depend on me, I'm the one that decide if a system is ordered or not.

another example is the classic mix of milk and coffee. there are more possible combinations of molecules of coffee and milk where they are mixed than there are where they are perfectly separated like water and oil. but even though they are not combined in a single entity, but actually floating around each other, I can say that they are actually a perfectly random system, like a noise pattern. one can say that a noise pattern is disordered, but if I separate the mixture in small chunks I can find that each chunk has extremely similar number of coffee and milk particles as if it was deliberately organized so the numbers of particles will match... so, should we consider it ordered or disordered ? you can, of course, say that the system is chaotic, because of chaotic dynamics, and that is where I believe the idea of entropy as ""disorder"" came from. but try to call a Chaotic system ""disordered"" and Lorenz itself will come from the grave to punch you in the face",1

"Hey quick question for those interested. How much do you need to cool a solar cell operating at, let's say, 23% efficiency?

My thoughts are that a solar cell should not change its internal energt U, so in other words deltaU or dU/dt should be 0. So 23% of the solar energy becomes electrical work, while the rest of the sun's power (1-0.23=0.77) becomes heat that accumulates in the solar cell.


In order for dU/dt (delta U) of the solar cell to be 0 you need to fulfill Q=W, so in other words you need to cool the cell to such an extent that the only heat that isn't cooled off equals the electrical power of the solar cell, in this case 0.54 times the power of the sun?

Given the amount of energy required to increase a kilogram of water by 1 degree celsius (1 kilocalorie, or 1 [large] Calorie), does that mean the same amount of energy will also increase a single gram of water by 1000 degrees celsius?

"No object is put on motion without the hit of an external force. Since there should be an initially force applied to an object in order for the object to start it state of motion, therefore there is acceleration involved for any object in motion. As long as the acceleration is not zero the object velocity should increase and increase to infinity, assuming the object is not under the influence of any external forces at all.

Example, suppose an object is suspended without any, whatsoever, forces acting on it. Now, you hit the object with something. So the object will start its motion. This means the object will begin with  acceleration. Does this positive acceleration remains with the object. Again assuming the object not being subjected to any external forces. If the object is under the influence of acceleration due to the initial hitting then the velocity of the object will keep increasing and increasing. So an object in motion will not continue its journey with constant velocity. That is an object in heaven in motion must be under a positive acceleration and with a non zero acceleration the velocity keep increasing. Would you please clear me about this subject? Thank you",1

"I cant understand the purpose, or effect of gravitational potential energy. isn't the ball you dragged up to infinate terminus of our gravity and dropped into a vaccuum just accelerating along a curve in space time? 
on a Side Note: doesnt an objects speed increase as an effect of increased gravity = faster time, so moving from slower time to faster time could increase acceleration  when introduced back to a constant. it'd be something special if the change of proximation to an object of mass changed the value/volume of contained energy like that, then gravity waves could be used to accelerate right? pardon my ignorance.

"k here is not representing the same thing as the k constant in electric force equation: F=kqq/r^2. 

k here is representing the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant depends on what materials are in between the two capacitor plates. Since the problem does not specify the material, we assume that it is air. The dielectric constant for air is so close to 1 that we might as well make it 1. That’s why he used 1 here instead of 9x10^9 as k

Note: you get 9x10^9 from e0(epsilon) by the equation (1/(4pi(e0)))=1/(4pi(8.85x10^-12))=9x10^9

Hopefully that cleared up some things",1

"I don't mean to over simplify things but particles (even those as large as Buckey Balls [the double slit experiment]) in a free flowing system ( ie. light shining on a plate) are in one state and when they are acted upon by any other energy field or matter they can have an observable change state.  
In fact the energy required to make an observation is enough to cause the state change.  
In the ""Free Flow"" state they exhibit the properties of a wave, when that state is interrupted by any external field the state changes.
In a static system a simple ruler or a bounced beam is enough to make measurements.    In a dynamic system the measurement requires a change in the kinetic energy of the system.   Even the radar used to measure a car's velocity has a slight (although minuscule) effect.    
In a free flowing liquid the introduction of a point restriction ( dip a stick into a smooth flowing creek) causes eddy currents that alternate from side to side.  This can be used to measure the flow rate, but only to a point.   If the flow rate is to slow it will not produce eddy currents.  The change of the rate of flow that produces eddy currents is a state change of the system.   Of course we can explain in detail why and how this state change occurs but the fact remains that the introduction of any point restriction into a free flowing fluid will cause eddy currents if the energy level is sufficient. 
What is the maximum size of particles that will conform to the double slit experiment in a zero G environment??
What happens in both of these experiments when they are in a super cooled environment?  
In my mind the triple point of water is a similar phenomena where water molecules exists in three states at once and any oscillation of the energy field can cause a change of state.",1

Where the f did nuclear physics and part 2 of QM go? I was planning on watching those this night.,1
All that we learned is okay. However a question comes in mind is that if a light ray / photon with energy equals work function hits an electron and sets it free from the bound of metal surface and another photon hit this free electron; will the photon not affect electron's kinetic energy or photon will only scatter and not absorbed? The statement that increasing the number of photons do not affect kinetic energy of electrons seems to be strict and leads to the conclusion that photon will only scatter in this case. Any one to confirm / explain it a little further?,1

"I've been reading about atoms and I'm a bit confused. According to the internet ""electromagnetic force"" holds the protons of the nucleus and electrons together while kinetic force of the electrons pulls them apart. But isnt this just general relativity?

As in; at first sight electrons and protons dont appear to be perfect opposites because an electron behaves differently (whizzing around outside the nucleus) and is also 1832 times less massive. But its energy is also comparably more massive than the proton per unit mass (MEv)

This is in line with the Energy - mass equivalence (E=mc2) suggesting that an electron is the antithesis of a proton but one has converted the majority of its mass to energy (electron), the other remains mainly mass and less energy.

So what is electromagnetic force? And assuming the the electron uncertainty cloud could be ""cooled"" to a state of equal mass/ energy as the proton (reducing its ability to stay away from the proton - kinetic energy) would they come together and annihilate eachother? Or leave just neutrons (0).
Wouldnt this mean that at absolute zero kelvin (heat death) atoms would vanish or at least leave neutrons?",1

Hey dude, I got a dumb question for ya over here.

Now I can't seem to find the answer, though that's probably due to my lackluster Google-fu skillz. Anywho, as I understand it the easiest to combat the magnetic fields generated by wires with roughly equal currents traveling in opposite directions is to have them wound together. The currents create opposing magnetic fields at nearly the same location, which results in  essentially no magnetic field being generated. What I'm unsure of is where the energy those magnetic fields goes. Are the wires respective magnetic fields still created its just that due to their proximity the field lines are highly concentrated between the two? Does that just lead to an elecromotive force in conductors in opposition to their currents and increase their resistance? Moreover does that lead to  additional heating of the wire/ noise in any signal? Do they simply cancel one another out completely so the energy never dissipates from the current? Is it lost in some other way ie. ultralow frequency radio waves? Or am I actually as dumb as I'm feelin and have missed something blatantly obvious?",1
3:53 why does he take the B from the wire on the left? The wire on the right also produces a magnetic field. Why can we not use it in the equation for the force? We have its current and could use that R=2. Why can't we do this?,1
What to do if we have different lengths wire?,1
can I ask how to compute the length of each wires if it is not given??,1
What if your question simply writes 'per unit length' and doesn't describe the length of the wires.,1
hey what white board app do you use,1
"What happens if they're of different length?
Newton's third law says that the force of wire 1 onto wire 2 has to be equal and opposite to the force of wire 2 onto wire 1.
Doesn't that necessitate that µ0*I1*I2*L2/(2πR) has to equal µ0*I2*I1*L1/(2πR), thus that L1 has to equal L2?",1

Reduction, Boost, no affect? we assume the second wire has no voltage, no current.  To produce current of 1amp, how much current/voltage do we need in the first wire. Let's assume they are like within 1cm.",1
"What makes you say if the force is attractive or repulsive.  It is certainly not the direction of the force of each wire by itself.
If that was the case, put a third wire on the far right with its current moving as the first wire, i.e. north.   Now what you gonna do?
It is arrow will be pointing to the left while your B wire's arrow will be pointing to the right?
CONFUSING AS HELL.

The thing is, in every other areas,  forces are always viewed as push force, not pull. A force is always exerted on things has the mental picture of pushing. 
The magnetic force is the only place that the arrows direction is not a push force but a pull force.
When you see an arrow pointing at something, it is not pushing on it, it means pulling on it.
This has never been verbalized.",1
   The theory states that the Force is proportional to the product of the two currents in the wires. This only remains true given that the lengths of the wires are the same right?,1

"(sorry im spamming this question in your comment sections)

hi !! if you were to add 90 (no deci pt.) and 21.5, would the answer be 112 or just 100? because i thought we had to match the sig figs of the number w the least amt. of decimals to the answer. the answer should be 100, so that it matches 90’s 1 sig fig. 

however, in my textbook, it says the answer is 112. so following your technique, maybe they did it as:

9 | 0
2 | 1 . 5
_____
11 | 1 . 5

but that would mean there would be two sig figs (and the answer still isnt 112). is the book wrong or did i not understand correctly ?

bc if the 90 DID have a deci pt. then the answer wouldve been 112. but it doesnt-",1

This cannot be true because the whole point is that clocks slow down as you approach the speed of light on a moving train.

Any chance of doing a video on general relativity?,1
Well done. Is General relativity next?,1
"Dear Crash Course, 
I believe you have made a mistake. In the video, you say that when 667 nanoseconds pass for Bob, only 577 nanoseconds have passed for the still reference frame. However, we know that t>t0, and that t= time for still reference frame and t0= time for moving reference frame and not the other way around as shown in the video. If Bob measured 667 ns and the girl measured 577, it would mean that time passed slower for the girl, which is not the case. 
This would mean, that if 667 nanoseconds pass for bob, the observer who is not moving, will measure the time to be 770 ns. This verifies that t>t0. 
Can you please put some light on the situation?

Best regards, 
Malak",1

"This is essentially the famous pole-vaulter running through a barn problem, so I'll use that analogy as it is more fun.  Alice is carrying a long pole through a barn with doors on each end.  At rest, the pole is too long to fit into the barn with both doors closed.  Alice, understanding special relativity, makes a bet with her friends Bob and Charlie that, if she can run fast enough, she can fit the pole inside the barn with both doors closed.  She arranges to have Bob close the front doors as soon as the end of the pole passes into the barn, and Charlie to open the back doors just before the front of the pole reaches the end of the barn.  
                                         
            A                              _____________
                                           /                           \
           O                            /                             \
____/ |\________         B (front door)      C (back door)
           /\                            _______________   

So, with the front doors initially open and the back doors initially closed, Alice runs with her pole through the barn, and Bob and Charlie both handle their door opening/closing duties.  Is the pole ever completely inside the barn with both doors closed at the same time? 

Let's first consider Bob and Charlie's perspective.  Since they occupy the same inertial reference frame (they are motionless relative to each other), I'll just say from Bob's perspective. So from Bob's perspective, the pole shrinks due to length contraction.  Assuming Alice runs fast enough, Bob will see the pole shrink so much that it becomes shorter than the barn.  So when he closes the front doors, the front of the pole will not yet have reached the back doors, hence Charlie will not yet have opened them.  Therefore, according to Bob, the pole fits inside the barn with both doors closed.

But now let's consider Alice's perspective.  According to Alice, the pole stays the same length it has always been. In fact, it is the barn that shrinks.  Clearly if the pole didn't fit into the barn at rest, it certainly won't fit into it now that the barn is shorter.  Therefore, the front of the pole will reach the back of the barn long before the back of the pole clears the front doors.  So Alice will say that Charlie opened the back doors before Bob closed the front doors, and the pole never fit inside the barn with both doors closed.  

How can this be? Relativity tells us that both points of view are equally valid.  The problem is with simultaneity.  Because of time dilation, two observers in different inertial frames travelling at some non-zero relative velocity will disagree on when some event happens.  In our example here, Bob and Alice will disagree on when Charlie opens the back doors.  Bob will say that Charlie opened the doors after Bob closed the front doors, but Alice will say that Charlie opened the back doors before Bob closed the front doors.",1

"This is eerily similar to the Twin problem. Suppose two twins. One is on Earth and the other is in relative motion at a constant speed of 0.5c, on a spacecraft. The twin eventually returns to Earth.  From the twin in the spacecraft, it could well appear that Earth is moving away from it at a speed of 0.5c. Upon returning which twin experienced time dilation so which twin will be older than the other and which will be younger? The younger twin is the one that experienced time dilation but who is this exactly?
I do not think I can explain this answer in a manner which is easy to explain however a solution was posted by minutephysics in his twin paradox video. The answer revolves around the notion that the perspective of time is rotated for one of the twins relative to the other. The twin who did experience time dilation is the one that goes off on his journey in the spacecraft so in this case, it would still be Bob that experiences the time dilation and so his clock will be behind yours :)

"To Arkalius80:  Thank you for mentioning I can post links to my videos.  I have my own reasons for not doing this.  I admire your thoroughness in replying to both my comments on this video.  Until you did, I did not realize I had commented 2 x here by mistake.  Sorry.  I realize I am displaying what you call arrogance by criticizing the theories of others.  I hope you realize many other physicists admit relativity theory and quantum theory, and other professionally used theories, have problems.  I accept any theory for both its good and its bad, and in physics I have tried to make improvements.  I have spent over 30 years trying to improve on the fundamental assumptions of the professionally used theories, to invent a theory which has more good and less bad.  Resultantly, I happen to have invented what I am certain is a better theory.  If you have viewed my videos, and my replies to others’ comments on them, you will understand why I am not publishing in any journal.  I think you need to rethink your position about being offended when someone criticizes a theory or promotes what they think is a better theory.  Would you be offended by, for example, Einstein, for criticizing the established professional theories of his time, and for promoting his relativity theory, which he invented to try to improve on them?  Criticism and promotion are a necessary part of science.  Who will know a problem exists if no 1 mentions it?  Who will know a solution exists if no 1 mentions it?  And instead of having an expert tell you which theory they think is better, you can decide for yourself.  In my video, “Particle 2 Slit Experiments Explained By Paul Marostica”, I propose what I think is a much more logical explanation of the results of particle 2 slit experiments than the explanation of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.  What do you think?  I would appreciate of any comment you would care to make after viewing that video.",1

Yeah but can relativity explain why I'm afraid to open a box that I nailed shut with a cat inside last year because I read it would be both alive and dead till I opened it.  But I'm not hearing anything when I shake the box and I'm almost certain the cat is only dead and there is 0% chance that when I open the box it will be alive. I'd like to know where Schrodinger got his cat for that experiment cause I'm pretty sure mine is dead.Whats relativity got to say about that?,1
You are still arguing about something that I don't question and that I accept since I learned about STR. All I claim is that STR is only valid within reference frames. It's only that I believe in something beyond those reference frames. Do you have an opinion on presentism (and possible infringement with STR) and the last paragraph in my previous comment?,1
"Fair enough. And I may took your first answer to my original question maybe a bit too deprecatory. But still, could you answer my original question (the very first sentence) with one or the other?

""Does STR postulate that there is really no absolute simultaneity or does it only postulate that it is impossible for humans to observe absolute simultaneity [...]?""

Or do you think that simultaneity can in itself never by absolute?",1

"Wait, so why is the speed of light constant?",1
the lightning part didn't make sense. Was there one strike or two?,1
"In that train example the light travels the same exact path for both observers it's just that the guy on the train isn't able to see one dimension of the travel. So how is there any kind of path length difference? That's like saying if I walk around the earth I think I just went in a straight line but an outside observer can see that I walked a circle around the sphere. I can't feel the curve but its still there, just like the guy on the train doesn't see the forward motion of the light but the light still moves forward. Am I missing something here?",1
"Yes, I believe that the correct way to explain this is that as a stationary observer on the platform, you would conclude that the lightning from the front of the train would reach Bob first. Which is not what happened from Bob's perspective.",1
"Where does it say in the video that light isn't moving forward? The guy on the trains sees the light moving at the speed of light, the lady on the platforms sees the light moving at the speed of light.",1
"Bob's sight is limited by being inside the train, and not taking the outside world into consideration. Are you saying that just because bob doesn't consider the world outside of the train that it doesn't have an effect on the motion of his light beam or ball?  I feel like this relativity thing is trying to separate things that are inseparable. I understand that to bob the ball looks like it goes in a straight line and in his reference frame it does, but his frame is nested inside of the platform observers frame so the angled path of the ball still exists even though he doesn't see it. To go one further, if you zoom out and consider that the platform is moving with the earth the REAL path is different than what the platform observer sees. Then you can add the movement of the earth around the sun, then the sun around the galaxy and so on... Instead of trying to separate every reference frame I think we need to add them all together to figure out the true path of the light beam. Maybe light doesn't move at all and what we are actually seeing is the speed of the earth in relation to a fixed point that light binds to upon emission?",1
"""Since Bob is at rest in an inertial reference frame, the outside world does not affect him or his ball or light.""

So if the train hits a wall outside of bobs reference frame he wouldn't feel anything?",1
"so when viewed from the platform the light beam has sideways motion and forward motion which gives it an angled path, but when viewed by bob inside the train that forward motion disappears? what happens to the forward momentum of the photons when you switch reference frames?",1
"Matt Nothing happens to the momentum of the photon. Refering back to the train, you as a stationary observer see the train as having a momentum of mv. However for bob, the train is stationary and you are the one with a momentum of mv (of different value).

So who is right? In special relativity, both would be right as the law of physics are obeyed in both reference frames.

The difference with photons is that its speed is constant, therefore time dilation compensates the difference in perceived speed",1
why do you need to account for a difference in perceived speed when the actual speed is not different?,1
"If I'm understanding this correctly, time appears to be moving more slowly on the train from the station, and more slowly at the station from the train. Is that right?",1
ok bare with me here. hypothetically you're on a ship in outer space this ship is traveling at 99.9% the speed of light once 99% the speed of light is reached a small ship to detaches and floats above the 1st ship and engages its boosters that will accelerate it to 99% the speed of light. ok what happens with the second ship once it begins to accelerate to 99% the speed of light? is the 2nd ship traveling faster than the speed of light relative to every object it was measured against before it started to accelerate.,1
"but what if 2 trains pass each other at the speed of light, what do they see?",1
I got a question. How do the light know it is moving to remained the speed when it was standing still? I just blew the whole theory didn't i?,1
"If a spaceship was traveling ½ speed of light while another spaceship was ¾ the speed of light traveling towards each other what would the people see as they passed each other? 
That’s a question I thought of that I don’t know the answer to.",1
"thats great but im talking from a outside Observer watching the ship traveling at 99% the speed of light, then watching a second ship detach traveling at the same speed accelerating at the same speed then firing its thrusters. relative to the first ship it will only be moving very slowly compared relativity. however compared to any Observer the 2nd ship should be moving faster than the speed of light. 2 attached ships. moving 99%c. they detach from each other. the 2nd ship now fires unused thrusters capable of accelerating itself to 99%C. how would an outside Observer view the 2nd ship already moving at 99%C now firing the unused Rockets. does the 2nd ship ever physically travel faster than the speed of light",1
"a) I think you make the mistake, of thinking, that there is a kind of objective perspective. But lets  reframe the question in a way that makes sense ( as I understand it): There are are three ships. ship 1 measures the speed of ship 2 with 0.99 c ship 2 measures the speed of ship 3 with 0.99 c  (in the same direction). what is the speed of ship 2 from the perspective of ship 1.
b) try to use the formula u learned in this episode. at 0.99 c y=7.09 (round about)
mhh ok I suppose, there is something wrong I expected it to be a little bigger than 10. Doesn't work out that way.
so hopefully someone finds the mistake and you finish the calculation with y=10.",1
"no, I meant the object that the light come out of. How does the light know to go at the same speed no matter which way and how fast the object is going?",1
"Dá di , perception and actuality are two very different things. if a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound?... absolutely it did. 

now one thing that might make sense is that when you are traveling at light speed... the theoretical speed limit of the universe, then time would hold still as every molecule and atom in your body would be moving at its maximum speed and not be able to move in any other direction without slowing that directional velocity. like a feather stuck on a grill of a car. nothing can move it react. you couldn't even perceive the event because your synapse would be frozen at that speed and direction. ... perhaps then, time and aging would change. for the rider the to was instantaneous, but for the stationary person, time has elapsed... of course the stationary person is correct and the rider was essentially put into stasis",1
"The speed of light is a subject that people talk a lot... I know! But Einstein said:"" that nothing can go faster then the speed of light. But who am i to say something like this... God can make the rules he want!"" He's right! What about the double speed of light? What if i put two flashlight againts each other and facing the oposite direction. When i turn the light on (on both flashlight) what would be the speed of the distance of each light. You might say to me... Francis! A speed is a reference of something moving away from a specific point. Well yes! One photon is moving away from the other photon. So! Wouldn't the speed be 2Xspeed of light? What do you think?",1

"imagine what you want however if ""light travels in a straight line"" then a flash would either miss the mirror or with a long mirror miss the flasher. 
2 in fact the opposite of what is described, if we imagine the light traveling the greater distance [2.5 meters more] then to travel more distance at the same speed called C, requires MORE time if this would occur then more time passed on the moving train, where the light moved in reality, not less dilated time.

For instance, if I want to convert 40 km/h to m/h (let's keep it simple: meter per hour!), following your example I'd have to go for:

40 km/h *  1000m/1km

...However, I could also go for:

40 km/h* 1m/0,001km. 

Mathematically speaking, that's the exact, same thing. Is it correct?",1

"I understand Huygen's principle, but why do the waves diffract then in both the x and y direction after it reaches the slit?",1
Why did this have no likes smh,1
"so basically, the bending of a wave occurs because each point is being repositioned when interacting with a slit. With the farther sides of the wave being blocked and the middle part of the wave still continuing forward, it displaced the wave to act as a curve when going out of the slit, hence the wave being spherical.

If the vertical velocity is already at zero, wouldn’t this be considered as the vertical acceleration due to gravity actually acting on the object to increase its velocity in a negative direction. Because the magnitude of the velocity is still increasing, just negatively. It would be different if the initial velocity in the y direction was 20 or 100ms^-1 for example but, wouldn’t it also be right to say that since the velocity in the y direction is originally zero, can’t we say that the -9.81 is actually increasing the velocity in a negative way?",1

THE CLEAR AND UNIVERSAL MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA:


Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. The Earth (A PLANET) is a MIDDLE DISTANCE form that is in BALANCED relation to the Sun AND the speed of light (c), AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. ACCORDINGLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. SO, the Earth constitutes the FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE in BALANCED and UNIVERSAL relation to what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!! INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. SO, time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA !!! GREAT !!! BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. Indeed, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense.


Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Indeed, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Accordingly, the rotation of the Moon MATCHES it's revolution. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!!


By Frank DiMeglio


WHY ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS UNIFIED AND BALANCED WITH/AS WHAT IS GRAVITY:


Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY are LINKED AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Therefore, Einstein's equations and Maxwell's equations are unified (given the addition of a fourth spatial dimension); AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma; AS TIME DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ACCORDINGLY, Einstein's equations predict that SPACE is expanding OR contracting in and with TIME; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.)


Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, the rotation of the Moon MATCHES it's revolution. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.


Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. THE SUN purely exemplifies time DILATION. INSTANTANEITY is FUNDAMENTAL. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!!


The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Let's compare this directly with BOTH a falling object AND the speed of light (c). Great. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. INSTANTANEITY is FUNDAMENTAL to the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience. Ultimately and truly, TIME is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The ultimate unification of physics/physical experience combines, BALANCES, AND includes opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT. It ALL makes perfect sense. THINK !!!


The Earth that undergoes time DILATION IS thus represented (ON BALANCE) as what is A POINT in the night sky, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (So, notice that the BLUE SKY IS no longer visible. Think.) E=mc2 IS F=ma. It is FULLY proven. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Alas, the INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. I have truly, CLEARLY, AND MATHEMATICALLY unified physics/physical experience. OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is THE EARTH. (Notice the black space of THE EYE, AND the DOME of a person's eye is ALSO visible.) THE EARTH is ALSO blue. Again, E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Time dilation proves that E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma, AS electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It ALL makes perfect sense. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.

Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Consider what is outer ""space"". NOW, consider WHAT necessarily constitutes what is the Sun. E=MC2 IS F=ma. NOW, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Think INSTANTANEITY ! TIME DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is the Earth. The sky is blue, AND WHAT IS THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AND THEN very carefully consider what is the EXPERIENCE of what is the Sun. E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=MA. Think about THE EYE !!! Great. NOW, also consider what is the EARTH/ground in BALANCED RELATION to/with WHAT IS THE EYElid. LOOK around. Think INSTANTANEITY !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. E=MC2 IS F=MA !!! It ALL CLEARLY does make perfect sense. Indeed, BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Beautiful. The INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE. It is a very great truth that the ability of thought to DESCRIBE OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT is similar to sensory experience. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY. In dreams, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE !!! The EARTH AND THE SUN are E=MC2 AND F=ma IN BALANCE. There is no outsmarting the genius of dreams. Importantly, dream experience GROWS/increases. In dreams, it is you AND other than you are IN BALANCE. GREAT. SO, you don't see any people on what is THEN the BLUE EARTH. Think !!! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=MC2 IS F=MA !!! Think very carefully about the experience of THE MAN who is standing on what is the EARTH/ground. Magnificent !!!

THE CLEAR AND UNIVERSAL MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA:


Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. The Earth (A PLANET) is a MIDDLE DISTANCE form that is in BALANCED relation to the Sun AND the speed of light (c), AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. ACCORDINGLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. SO, the Earth constitutes the FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE in BALANCED and UNIVERSAL relation to what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!! INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. SO, time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA !!! GREAT !!! BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. Indeed, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense.


Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Indeed, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Accordingly, the rotation of the Moon MATCHES it's revolution. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!!


By Frank DiMeglio


WHY ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS UNIFIED AND BALANCED WITH/AS WHAT IS GRAVITY:


Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY are LINKED AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Therefore, Einstein's equations and Maxwell's equations are unified (given the addition of a fourth spatial dimension); AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma; AS TIME DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ACCORDINGLY, Einstein's equations predict that SPACE is expanding OR contracting in and with TIME; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.)


Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, the rotation of the Moon MATCHES it's revolution. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.


Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. THE SUN purely exemplifies time DILATION. INSTANTANEITY is FUNDAMENTAL. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!!


The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Let's compare this directly with BOTH a falling object AND the speed of light (c). Great. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Time DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma. INSTANTANEITY is FUNDAMENTAL to the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience. Ultimately and truly, TIME is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The ultimate unification of physics/physical experience combines, BALANCES, AND includes opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT. It ALL makes perfect sense. THINK !!!


The Earth that undergoes time DILATION IS thus represented (ON BALANCE) as what is A POINT in the night sky, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (So, notice that the BLUE SKY IS no longer visible. Think.) E=mc2 IS F=ma. It is FULLY proven. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Alas, the INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. I have truly, CLEARLY, AND MATHEMATICALLY unified physics/physical experience. OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is THE EARTH. (Notice the black space of THE EYE, AND the DOME of a person's eye is ALSO visible.) THE EARTH is ALSO blue. Again, E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Time dilation proves that E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma, AS electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It ALL makes perfect sense. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.

"I have a correction, is the power of ex. 4 not 29?

Because my calculation says that it is 29 not 9.

R= 5.0 x 10^29m",1
Could you please tell how you calculated the 3rd sum at 6:52 cause I have a similar sum in my text book and I can't calculate it!🙏,1
Did you guys notice that he's not pushing nearly enough calculator buttons LMAO still very good he's probably got them already done,1
How'd you get the anser in 4:10,1
at 7:00 shouldn't we add the radius of the sun and the radius of  earth to R?,1
is there a direction to the force for the last question??,1
How do I calculate it in my scientific calculator?,1
Why did you us the Fe and the Fs calcualtions from #5 to solve problem #6?,1
"I would like to challenge the scientific community especially physics on the perception of a force unseen called gravity...

I would like to suggest another way to Invision gravity not as a force carrier of attraction but as a suspension phenomenon

Suspension of mass as a phenomena of a trajectory spin spiral of mass changing the observed trajectory from the master trajectory spin spiral mass, by increasing its illusion of a gravity attraction force from a change in the observed trajectory spin spiral mass with in an originating phenomenon as a trajectory spin spiral of mass...

A momentum field disruption by a change in trajectory spin spiral of mass direction causing the quantified mass of trajectory spin spiral mass to change its spatial resonance spiraling of mass as in lose inertia momentum or gain inertia momentum or resonant with in the master mass trajectory spin spiral creating an illusion of a force field called gravity when it really is a loss or gain of velocity locally with in the master spiraling mass....

 as a result of trajectory spin spiral of mass with in an resonant envelope of a trajectory spin spiral of mass...

This resistance of change of direction of a trajectory spin spiral mass...

Change of real time coordinates interaction from the resonant trajectory spin spiral of the master envelope of mass as a trajectory spin spiral as from a deviation of the secondary trajectory spin spiral mass against the resonant trajectory spin spiral of mass as a momentum field, creating a suspension phenomenon not an attraction force field called a gravity.... rather an suspension phenomenon that increase or decrease the total trajectory spin spiral mass of the Master resonance derivatives observed locally with in the envelope of a mass spiraling as a trajectory spin spiral of mass within the mass with it's own quantified trajectory spin spiral of mass

So we are basically attached to the master resonance of a trajectory spin spiral as a planet, solar system, galaxy, galactic clusters, observable universe....as a quantified trajectory spin spiraling mass with quantified subsets within the spiraling mass with a trajectory....why the spin?


Whatcha think?

Anyone?

Good day everyone!

Gravity is a Suspension Phenomena not an attraction force field that has never been seen the so called graviton cuz it doesn't exist because the illusion called gravity is really a suspension phenomena....

Once we accept it as a suspension phenomena we should be able to find alternate ways of transporting ourselves through the cosmos without energetic systems other than being able to de-energize or energize are local trajectory spins spiral within the master spiral... That may take more understanding at the subatomic phenomena then the use of energetic systems as in fuel rockets

Just a thought

"Grow too much food so when the food truck is empty, it takes back the extra food with blemishes for fertilzer on indoor crops where there's no need for pestcde as there no bugs indoors, you can grow any crop with with above  or below ground (mirrored clay wall) vertical farms, magnifying glass panels at ground level, solar 24/7/365 growing seasons, indoor fresh water fish farms, indoor whaling, grow grass and put cows and chickens on it all year round (won't even stink up a metropolitan city in a high rise) plant dirt and grass and cows where torn down factories left concrete waste slabs) in a building grass can be grown in many floor to ceiling returnable plats on a conveyer, that's takes it up to the dairy floors for food where the cows eat it at 3' above the floor, the floor has a squeegee system and the cows are herded from one half of the floor to the other for cleaning: an automated squeege cleans the floor and empties it into a special for drain: the cow manure goes back down in a pipe for fertilizer : ) the floor has a floor washer, like a car wash, but with clean spayed water on the floor and a squeegee system : ) So good

 Salt water can be separated with oxygen being released like a rain forest to the outside air while the electricity generated disinfects waste water as it makes energy (NASA does this to make cabin oxygen while it releases everything else to space) Everyone uses a small steam distiller to disinfect and remove salt at the sink for drinking and cooking, everyone gets soft water to their house from the ocean, (already has natural salt in it) drag pipelines to every continent, more jobs, and divert river system maybe to deserts to take sea water rise from melting ice caps and maybe restock what used to be an ocean, natural sand filter at least, just don't put sharks in there and you can surf : )

 NASA uses electrolysis to make cabin oxygen from water and they release the hydrogen gas to outer space, you could use the h as clean energy and release the oxygen to the planet as a rain forest, drag ocean soft water to municipalities, they use a small steam distiller at the sink for drinking water, everyone's off toilet to tap, and you use electrolysis to disinfect the waste water and make energy. You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there's solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation. You can grow every crop in the world, everywhere, indoor, with every climate and 24/7/365 agriculture, and not even smell farm animals in a building 

For what it costs to build housing here and grow food on welfare, we can pay people who want to go to another country and build indoor farms and drag ocean lines and build clean energy waste water stations. Who wants to get paid to go to south America and maybe even live there? Whether you were from there, want to get paid to go on a humanitarian effort, or maybe move there : )

With today's technology and the skilled people who came here to learn skills, maybe they would love to develop their home turns and make it great, with more than enough food and water and electricity for everyone, everywhere

People work for each other for paper and out of an overflow they trade. Everywhere will be a good home for everyone who lives there

Food in cold climates can be grown underground in clay dug out cylinders with mirrored walls, solar night lights and heaters and glass solar roofs",1
"I have a problem, Ive been given this paper with some works like that one of the problems say. An alien spacecraft is out in space leaving an unknown planet. It detects the pull gravity due to this unknown planet to be 100 N. Later the Alien recheckd the pull on their spacecraft and detects it to be 33 N. By what factor has their distance changed as they left the unknown planet?

I did an inventary to know what I have

I have:

M = 100 N (the unknown planet)
m = ?
r^2 =?
F = 33 N  (Force of attraction)

"In the last question with the rock and the cart, if the rock lands in the middle of the cart instead of at the back, since the rock would be initially stationary there would static friction between it and the floor of the cart.

Only a single rope is use here. Then why are we considering its parts that are coiled as individuals.",1

Hi from where are you,1
"it took me several replays to finally get this. ON the slim chance you do anything else on this, I would put the equation for Magnetic field as well as the flux that way we can see WHY the flux is either decreasing or increasing. Also, is there a rule for the directions for Bex and Bin to keep flux equal? as in, if flux decreasing and Bex is into page, then Bin is into page as well",1
Doesn't the change in the magnetic flux cause a induced electric field? And wouldn't the induced electric field cause the work to be done on the electrons that create a voltage and current?,1
"I'm confused about the example with the straight wire. He says at 8:48 that if the flux is decreasing then the system will try to oppose that and increase the flux to bring it back, but the induced current is found to be out of the page to ""support a decrease in flux"". Could someone explain that? Why would we support a decrease in this scenario if the system want's to increase it so it's back to equillibrium?",1
For the last problem where I is decreasing shouldn't the induced current move CW to oppose? Original B is decreasing out of the page. which produces an increasing field into the page  in the loop and I moving CCW.  According to Lenz law there must be.an I opposing the new field so current has to move CW and B must be the same direction as original B out of the page.,1
3:40 What is the reason behind making the inside of the coil into the page? How does that oppose the existing uniform magnetic field?,1
what happens if the magnetic field is constant though or if the current is constant?,1
"why does the flux decrease when you decrease the current? Won't B increase, and consequently the flux?",1
   How'd it go?,1
OMG. How the hack you can make me understand of this!,1
"But what about the magnetic field, outside the coil. If we take the first example, the magnetic field created by the induced emf, would go against the increase in flux inside the coil, but wouldn’t it go with the magnetic field outside the wire. Wouldn’t it increase the field outside the wire, and induce even more current. I think the magnetic field/flux, only affects the inside of the coil, but why is that? Is there a law for that?",1
what happened to the direction of current when the wire is fully in the magnetic field?,1
"i dont believe the magnetic field around a wire conductor is oriented circumferentially. where is the north and south in such case? rather, the lines of magnetic force travel from the point of polarization to the furthest point of the conductor.",1
8:40 why the flux is decreasing as the current decreasing?,1
"Um, at 3 minutes into your video you state the ""right-hand rule""...? In fact it's the left hand rule that demonstrates the direction of current flow/flux lines, so you have it backwards? I quit watching after that. Please clarify?",1

"Lift: Because the air moves faster over the top of the wing, it is less dense (more spread out). Less dense air means lower air pressure. 
The air pressure difference between the top and bottom of the wing is what causes the lift.
This is the principle behind Bernoulli's Equation, which says the energy in  the air between its pressure (the outward expanding force of a parcel of air and a form of energy density) and its kinetic energy (as given by the v squared terms) are conserved. 
What causes a decrease in lift by ice buildup on wings?
The drag on the air causes it to slow down, negating the pressure difference.
Moreover, it causes turbulence at the trailing edge of the wing due to less airflow over the top of the wing.",1

Thanks! How do I work out velocity of air over and under the wings?,1
Does the area refer to total surface area of the wing or the surface area of the top face of the wing?,1
"This is probably a stupid question, but I cant phrase it right to get google to return and answer.

What effect would jet engines exiting force have on a wingspans lift if situated in front of them, far enough for them not to melt? Would it increase lift or is there some paradox I'm missing.",1
Is there any difference between Lift Force and Upthrust,1
How about the Symmetric airfoil ? at 0 angle of attack the V of wind are  the same on the lower and upper airfoil ? Please tell the lift force with >0 angle of attack !,1
"So technically, Bernoulli's equation applies to streamlined (non-turbulent), non-viscous flow, for any two points along a streamline. No streamline goes along both the top and bottom of the roof. What is the justification for applying Bernoulli's equation in this way?",1
Doesn't Bernoulli's  theorem work on the pressure difference along the same stream line????,1
"I don't know if I have too many missing variables but I cant solve this problem.

Rectangular Object:

Object is slanted at 25 degrees.
Object has height of 65  inches.
Object has width of 36 inches. 
Object weighs 180 pounds in weight.

Density of air surrounding the object is 1.3

Do we not use Coefficient of Lift when dealing with an airfoil shape?
What is total velocity if Lift equals weight?",1
"There is an equation called ""Lift Force Equation"" and in that equation, there is no velocity differential. Instead, there is only one velocity, which is aircraft velocity. Why are they ignoring V2-V1 and write only V ? Additionally, we know that lift force increases as aircraft speed increases. How can I understand it through this equation you wrote? V2 will increase to the same extend V1 does. Doesn't it?",1
so the wind goes under the house????,1
"Damn smart question. I have another question. If what is wanted is for the top of the airfoil to have more pressure so that the air moves faster and generates lift, why don't some planes or jets have their propellers on top of the wings instead of beneath it? Wouldn't that reduce the need for so much power from propellers for take of or just flight in general?",1
"Why is the gravity is 9.8, not -9.8",1

At the macroscopic level, the varying intensity of each spot I imagine conserves exactly all the energy, but what about at the quantum level where there are still photons involved even though the double slit experiment sacrifices the ability to pick them out?  The photons can't collide and vanish into oblivion, and some versions of this experiment prove that they don't.

Is this evidence for pilot wave theory, or is there more to it?",1

Have you seen this formula?...

I= I(max) x Sin(theta)
E= E(max) x Sin(90+theta) in the case of inductor

And

I= I(max) x Sin(theta)
E= E(max) x Sin(90 minus theta) in the case of Capacitor. 
Note that when ever the voltage or current is alternating, the ‘theta’ always changes

Have you done the ‘Impedence Triangle’
That is all related with the phase difference. I will see if i can suggest you some links of videos...",1
"Rofaida Elsayed well its all the same in any voltage. 
Just think of it like this , when Current in DC begins to rise, it acts as the 1/4th part of the AC current. Imagine 1 full cycle of AC graph till 2pie. Then imagine it till pie/2. And that is where the DC becomes constant. And after that, current flows through inductor. 
It also makes sense as the phase shift is seen in sine of theta. 
Theta keeps changing in ac. But in dc , the theta increases from zero to 90 and stays there. It makes sense as sine of 90 is also 1. Which could be the maximum value of current a dc circuit could ever have",1

So just a question from someone that is slow at understanding this stuff. In the Video we said let the x axis be the direction of the wave and the y and Z axis be the E field and the B field. This wave then propagate through a vacuum  at the speed of light (3E8 m/s). So does this mean the RATE in which the E field induces the B field and vice sa versa has to happen at a rate faster than the speed of light or does it mean that the rate in which the two fields inducing each other IS at a rate of 3E8?,1

The homeowner desires that a ceiling fan with light kits be installed in 5 different rooms.
Each fan contains a light kit that can accomodate four 60-watt lamps. Each fan motor draws a current of 1.8 amperes when operated on high speed. 
It is assumed that each fan can operate more than three hours at a time and therefore must be considered a continuos-duty device. The fans are to be connected to a 15-ampere circuit.
Because the devices are continuos duty, the circuit current must be limited to 80% of the continuos connected load.
How many fans can be connected to a single 15-ampere circuit?

I want to use a TEC or multiple TECs for cooling a water system, I'm happy to power these and deal with cooling etc I'mnot that fussed about theor efficiency, however, these TEGs are always prefaced with being massively inefficient, so... if I run the TECs to do their cooling job, would it make sense for me to use TEGs as heat sinks, loop the power generated back into the system and recover 5% whilst efficiently cooling the TECs using the seekbeck effect? IE it will absorb the heat ""inefficiently"" doing exactly what I need it to whilst also recycling some of the heat generated, I'm guessing it would make more sense to have a heat sink to build up a stable heat in something then have the TEGs feeding off the heat of that? Rather than trying to stick them directly to each other like hot output of TEC to hot input of TEG? I'm not looking to make a perpetual motion machine or anything, but it seems like I'm killing about 4 birds with one stone by doing this?

"For question 3, because the charge first decelerates from B to A, then comes to a stop, then accelerates towards C, wouldn't the total work done on the charge be positive, the potential energy be decreasing and KE increasing?

"How does a voltage develop across the unconnected end of a single wire connected to one terminal of a battery and the other terminal? 

If the battery’s net charge is zero, then for a 12 V battery, one terminal would be at a potential of +6 V with respect to a conductor at infinity, while the other terminal would be at –6 V. At the physical center in the space between the two terminals of the battery, the voltage is zero.
If we then connect a small wire to, say, the positive terminal, a few excess point charges will move onto the wire, and that wire will now be at the same potential as the battery terminal: +6 V. The wire will be surrounded by an e-field, and since the lines of electrostatic flux must always terminate upon charges, the wires must possess an excess surface charge. 

In the above we assumed the net charge of the battery was zero. Supposing that the battery had a net charge. Then how would the charges, potentials and voltage be changed? 

Before we answer this, it would be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level.
Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two as in the following two videos:
i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and 
ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo 

Returning to our question of the voltage of the single wire connected to one battery terminal,  we assume the net charge of the battery was not initially zero. Perhaps someone with rubber-sole shoes carried the battery while walking on a wool carpet or perhaps the battery was charged to –5000 V, and would deliver a tiny spark if touched. In that case one terminal would still be 12 V different than the other terminal, perhaps –5000 V on the positive terminal and –5012 V on the negative. 

It is not possible in this brief post to discuss in more detail the process of production of the voltage of the single wire without a detailed discussion of the capacitance and potential of single conductors.
The last frame References in video #1  lists textbook 4 which discusses these topics comprehensively using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of voltage of a single short and long wire with and without a net charge on the battery.",1
What does it mean electric potential at point A. I am confused because I am expecting difference between two points.,1
"Something dosen't make sense here for me...for number 4, the ke is increasing- makes sense. What doesn't make sense is how electric potential increased too... the formula is v=pe/q. This means that both PE and Ke increased, but that can be it. Can someone please explain ???",1
ye konsa edition  ha?,1
So what happen in a battery?  How much electric potential are in each pole?,1
"Yeah same here I am a month behind as well. My prof doesn't really know how to lecture and uses the class time just for unnecessary stuff. My current grade rn in the class isn't looking good but I am still hanging on it and hoping to pass the class. :D Also, what's the update?",1
"4:43 this is backwards, isn't it? V_ab is the voltage at A with respect to B. You would write the integral with ""a"" as the lower limit and ""b"" as the upper limit. V_ab is Vb - Va. 

That makes me question a few things. Do people teach these terms differently?",1
"I have a question. I learned that the cathode has a higher electric potential than the anode (the positive has a higher electric potential than the negative) but the negative is the one that has the higher electrons thus more charge thus logically higher potential energy right? Then why is it not true? Why does the positive terminal has a higher potential energy than the negative?? If anyone knows please i need help because I'm suffering to understand. 
It also makes sense since the electrons flow from the low electric potential (anode) to the high electric potential (cathode).
But WHY",1

"What about when you don't look at it, does all of this still happen? Shrodinger's potential...",1
" if the negative plate has a negative charge how can it have zero volts? Isnt zero volts associated with an object that has zero net charge? P.s. i watched this and other videos to get an understanding of what voltage is and how it works, and i still dont know. I saw electrons and protons emit an electric field and when two objects with equal opposite net charges are next to each other it creates a potential difference aka a voltage, but then you go and say a negatively charged plate has a voltage of zero. What makes it make even less sense is you are saying one plate with a net charge does have a voltage and the other plate that also has a net charge has no voltage. If an object with a net charge has a voltage, why does one plate have zero volts? Am i learning this wrong or is it being taught wrong?",1
how did it go?,1

I am confused now if there is a negative sign in the formula V = W/q because in our text book, there is no negative sign and then, when we solve the problems, we consider the sign of charge and put them in V = W/q. We don't use V = -W/q. So, what is the difference between them? If I use your formula, the answer is a little bit changed exactly, the sign. So, I want to know that which one is true.

"WHAT OBJECT OCCUPIES THE MOST SPACE?:

The answer, incredibly AND ON BALANCE, is WHAT IS E=MC2 !!!! Here's the full proof and the explanation.

The SPACE that surrounds us IS quantum gravitational (ON/IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great.

Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS “mass”/energy is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Great.

To answer the question: “What is nothing in accordance with physics (AND TIME)?”, we must understand (ON BALANCE) WHAT IS SOMETHING; AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. The ultimate unification and understanding of physics/physical experience (AND TIME) combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites. Carefully consider what is THE EYE (ON BALANCE). Do notice the associated black “space” AND the dome AS WELL. NOW, carefully consider what follows !!!! The following proves what is the fourth dimension ON BALANCE.

WHAT IS E=MC2 is the fundamental basis for the true understanding of what is inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE !!!! (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE.) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2, c squared CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. INDEED, consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE; AS two AND three dimensional SPACE are, in fact, BALANCED !!!! Great. What is gravity is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked. Consider what is the ORANGE AND setting SUN. Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) MOON. It is the same size as what is THE EYE. Notice what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Indeed, consider complete combustion !!!! (I have mathematically proven the fourth dimension.) The density of what is pure WATER IS HALF of that of what is packed sand/wet packed sand. Now, WHAT IS THE EARTH IS ALSO BLUE !!!! The rotation of WHAT IS “THE MOON” matches the revolution, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked (AND BALANCED) opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, I have solved WHAT IS the coronal heating “problem”. GREAT. (Indeed, consider what is lightning.)

Absolute SPACE IS the truly and fundamentally BALANCED inertial frame (or SPACE). Indeed, “mass”/ENERGY is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE (ON BALANCE) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS this proves what is the FOURTH dimension. Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Great !!!! Think. The fourth dimension AND WHAT IS E=MC2 are FUNDAMENTALLY consistent with/AS what are wave/particle duality AND the fact that c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE (REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE !!!! INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS “mass”/ENERGY is (CLEARLY) electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), I have mathematically proven and explained what is the FOURTH dimension; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AND consider what is complete combustion (ON BALANCE); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Great. It is proven. Finally, ON BALANCE, notice WHAT IS the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Magnificent !!!! Think. It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!! Notice WHAT IS “THE MOON” (ON BALANCE) !!!! THINK !!!! ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT !!!! CONSIDER TIME AND TIME DILATION ON BALANCE !!!! GREAT !!!! AGAIN, do notice WHAT IS the ORANGE “SUN” ON BALANCE !!!! Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE.

"+fatsquirrel75  I applaud the CC Physics approach.  Unlike what you suggest, it is honest.  Physics is a mathematical subject.  You want to learn it?  Learn the math.  Suggesting that physics should be taught without math is as silly as suggesting biblical studies should be taught without Hebrew and Greek.  Every decent seminary requires it's students to study Hebrew and Greek.  You want that MDiv?  Learn Hebrew and Greek!  You want to learn Hispanic literature?  You are going to have to learn Spanish.  You want to study Baudelaire and Rousseau?  Learn French.  Want to learn Organic Chemistry?  You got to memorize the dammed reactions.  Want to learn botany?  You got to memorize all those different kinds of flowers and leaves.  Learning is not easy.  People who learn are people who struggle.",1

"GelidGanef
For me its seems that this video aims to be part of a series ""crash course physics"", not in deep math guide with added physics.

Also if one plans to make a series of short & informative videos about physics, doing math  is not the way to do it.

Physics can be understood without going deep in math.
As it can be viewed both from a rational, and empirical viewpoint - physics is dealing with reality, yes math is an useful tool for describing it but its not the only one, even tough it is the most useful. Stating that one can understand physics only from a mathematical viewpoint is very shortsighted.

Tell me please why acceleration is beyond comprehension without knowledge of calculus?
(while i agree that it cannot be calculated, it can be understood)",1
"Why do everyone complain about the speed of her speech? All crash-course videos are like this, it's the whole point to squeeze a bunch of information into a short video.",1

"So you mean a crash course in women, is that what you mean to say?",1
"If it takes a student in Astrophysics to follow it, it is clearly to fast-paced :) Target audience is high school students, isn't it?

I'm a Uni student in physics as well, or rather chemistry perhaps - a mix of both really, so I think I have OK background. Still I feel the need for additional 0.3 seconds between sentences so that I have the time to verify what she says is correct.

Both series on history are great. ""wait for it... the mongols!"" recurring  joke! :) I liked the astronomy-series too. Great presenter! Most presenters are good, including this one, but the edit people let her down. I actually hoped the astronomy would be more advanced than it turned out to be. Thus I had great hopes for Physics.",1

If the image height is negative, shouldn't the image distance to object distance be positive to maintain the original equation?",1

"We were all born into a world without reason and our understanding of it through science although brilliant will always be fiction, how do we know the world is not being held up by a stack of tortoises.

"+WaterMelonFan1 I'm an academic advisor at an American post-secondary school, who has a bit of familiarity with the British system (though I am more familiar with post-secondary education there). AP Physics 1 and 2 are courses taught in secondary schools over an entire school year (Fall to Spring) that culminate in a test and is intended to cover the same material found in Algebra and Trigonometry based physics courses (often called ""College Physics"") that comprise a single semester of post-secondary education. This is likely to be the rough equivalent of the British ""A-levels"" Physics. This is distinct from more advanced, Calculus based Physics, which are often labeled by topics they cover, such as ""Mechanics and Heat"" and ""Optics and Light"" etc. and are called ""University Physics"" (sometimes ""Engineering Physics"") Those going into a medical field typically only need the Algebra/Trigonometry based physics (this course), those going into other STEM fields, especially any type of engineering, physics, or mathematics, typically need the Calculus based physics courses as part of the course of study for their first degree. Those going into non-STEM fields tend to avoid these physics and instead opt to take basic physics and/or astronomy if they want a physics based course to meet their science requirement (US schools typically require a minimum of two semesters in a life or physical science). Does that help a little?",1

What else would I need?",1

1. In space, there is a space shuttle that does't move.  Mass of this shuttle is always constant. This space shuttle has a rocket engine which produce a constant force of 100N. When the engine is started and the ship has a constant thrust of 100N, when the ship starts to accelerate, will the acceleration be constant and remain constant (let's assume 10m / s), or maybe the acceleration will start to decrease as the speed increases? It is related to the rule Ek = 1 / 2mv ^ 2 ???

2. Same space shuttle doesnt move. Shuttle start to accelerate from 0km/h to 10km/h in 5 seconds and it takes ""X"" energy for example. How much energy it will needed to accelerate also 10km/h more in also in 5 seconds when it allready have velocity of 100km/h ? Also ""X"" energy? Or much more ""X"" of energy? And why is that?",1

I understand how you did it. but why wouldnt ""1"" in the table for time be equal to the initial time  which the velocity would be 15. how is there any change in position at 0 seconds.  I understand how you solved the problem for acceleration but im confused with why the 0 was the initial time for the 15 m/s velocity",1

So if the acceleration wouldn't be constant, like it goes 42 m/s² to 43m/s² and the 41m/s² and then 42m/s2, the equasion (which is bery simple) would be v1+v2. The changed velocity would be the stable velocities. Right?",1

Why did we divide V by 15 when we wanted to calculate voltage drop for 15 meters, but then multiply it by 300 when we wanted to calculate voltage drop for 300m? Shouldn't we take the original resistance at 20 C (1.783 mv) and divide it by 300m instead?",1
"Hi, just a question to do with the difference between single-core cable and twin cable. If you have a Cross-Sectional-Radius (CSA) on a cable of 2.5mm and it is a twin cable, do you double the Cross-Sectional-Raduis (CSA) to 5mm as you are sending a set voltage( Let’s say 230v for me in the UK) down 2 cables, in which case you half the voltage as it’s going down 2 separate cables?

Because this would then change the value of resistance at the end of the circuit.

(I was thinking that, as you needed a force to push it) Let's say also we have two plates (P1,P2) which both varies in mass, the plate (P1) with the bigger mass needs more force to make it accelerate (F = ma) to a certain velocity, and the plate with a smaller mass (P2), which means that it needs less force to make it accelerate to the same velocity. As the viscosity coefficient was determined by the equation (η=Fl/vA), then doesn't that mean that the plate with the larger mass would increase the viscosity of the fluid?

"question about this 2:21:50, the net force on the object equals its acceleration, the net torque on the object equals its rotational acceleration.

So is the net force on the objectless because the ball had less gain in translational velocity?

If I have a heavy object on a seesaw close to the center, and a lighter object on the other side further away from the center. the torques would cancel out and the object would not rotate. However, if there is a net force, then it would translate, but given that the objects are stationary, then the net force is 0.

Using this same assumption would the rolling ball experience less net force?",1

Could you make a Vedic about unit if centrical force,1
"This is what I think about? Is it correct.

Centrifugal force in circular motion  is comparable to the the reaction force in linear motion on the driver when he applies the brakes?

The forces applied on the car to stop is the braking forces exerted in the backward direction.

The force that throws u in the forward direction after braking is your body’s reaction.

Braking force is comparable to the inward pull it tension i the spinning string and if the string loses its strength the cutoff portion would feel the centrifugal force and would be thrown away radially out.

If a stone is attached to a spinning string or rope the stone would go tangentially out due to the tangential or instantaneous velocity.

Radially Inward acceleration always exists because the velocity is continuously changing.
The radially inward leads to radially inward force which is newtons second law of motion. 

Centrifugal force is the mass of the rock times the inward acceleration. It is a fictitious force.  The real force is centripetal force.

Where as the centripetal force proportional to square of the velocity and inversely proportional to the radius.",1

And an object called C, with equal electron and proton (neutrally charged) that have the size of a football ball.

Will A's electrons go for B or C ?

If the Earth is neutrally charged, and you stick a negatively charged object into the ground, Earth sucks up the object's electrons. But, since the earth has more electrons, would the earth now be negatively charged? If so, what would happen if you got another negatively charged rod and put it into the ground? Is there not enough electrons to affect Earth's neutral charge? If so, would it be possible to gather a whole bunch of electrons to transfer into the ground to change Earth's neutral charge?",1
"0:51 So, the tape on the bottom stole electrons from the table, AND the top piece of tape?",1

The professor says ""so connecting a charged object to the ground creates a way for the charge to leak into the earth, rendering the object electrically neutral."" But then presents an example where the object that was grounded is left with a positive charge: ""The negative charges scurry away [after grounding], leaving the metal rod with an overall positive charge.  Now, if we sever the connection to the ground, our rod remains positively charged.""

Do you have access to EVREYTHING or would you need a patreon subscription?,1
Basically YouTube has monetization so when every video is played he gets revenue for every ads we play at the beginning so when video is played he gets paid. Say if he gets 0.10cents per 1000 ad plays and his minimum views stands between 650k-1M so basically he earns average of 650 dollars per video if his video has 650k views or if he has 1000k views he probably gets 1000dollars per video. Which is quite a good revenue.. i said the average amount per 1000 views is 0.10 usd which can vary according to location may be he can get upto 6usd per 1000 views so that will give eg 650k views = 39k USD which is good revenue isn't it?

You have used old equation of internal energy i.e dE=q-w but as per IUPAC the new equation has been changed i.e. dE=q+w. Due to this the sign convention of work will change i.e. work done BY the system is taken as NEGATIVE and ON the system is POSITIVE.#Thank you😊,1

"can someone correct me but the very first question of the video, shouldn't it be 300 - (-500) because the system is doing 500J of work therefore is -500j. The video shows 300 - 500j. is that a typo or am I missing something?",1

So P2 = P1 – QR

So more flow i will take more pressure will drop and I will get output flow at low pressure.

Doubt 1 :-

Physically it will look to me like following 

A) low flow (Q) high pressure (P2) condition - at outlet side velocity of  water leaving would be higher
 
B) High flow low pressure (P2) condition - at outlet side velocity of water leaving would be less

Doubt 2 

Or similarly someone tell me 2 cases 

Case 1 :- P1 = 4 kg/cm2  and P2 = 2kg/cm2
Case 2 :- P1 = 4Kg/cm2  and P2 = 1kg/cm2

In which case flow through pipe is higher ?
My answer would be case 2

Why not just use all the weight in first place to try and turn a turbine .... See you just now know that will not work ... That's how your idea will also not work :P hehehe,1
"+Ddub1083   We appear to have at least three separate disagreements.  1. The relationship between work and energy, a matter of physics. 2. The convention of labeling different kinds of work depending on the energy source or working medium, a matter of English usage, not physics.  3. The nature of :Darko's engine.  Let's deal with the third one right here.  He did not define it very well.  Reading carefully, he mentioned using gravitational energy to compress an unspecified fluid, creating heat, that heat to be transferred to water, boiling it to power a steam expansion engine which he calls a turbine, presumably to turn a generator to produce electrical energy.

Can we at least agree that his device is silly and there is no need to discuss its details?",1
"+Ddub1083   I started off trying to give :Darko a reasonable answer to his question: was his device workable?  The question of the relationship of energy and work is not central to his question.

Regarding energy and work, consider this.  Is there such a thing as energy independent of work, or at least independent of the possibility of work?  In order to have work, something has to pass from higher energy to lower, and the work done on it is precisely equal to the energy difference. If you put it back, the energy is precisely returned.  If there were no energy gradient, there would be no work.  No work, no way to detect energy.  So without work, is there such a thing as energy?  Is work a manifestation of energy or is energy an invention to explain work?  And can you tell the difference between them?",1

"Can you consider the ambulance question but if the ambulance is parked and the observer travels toward the ambulance at the same speed, 30 m/s. Logically, I feel as though the answer should be the same, however, when worked out, the original f' is ~877Hz and in my question it is ~870Hz. Can you explain why there is a difference in observed frequency between these scenarios? Thank you.",1
I the third example are they not moving away from each other giving us +vs and -vo??,1
"In the 3rd example, is the the car not moving west and the driver moving east , is that not in the opposite direction which will decrease the value of the Frequency??? Letting us use -vo and +vs",1
What do you do for a living? Because you are absolutely needed in academia!,1
"Hello, This lesson is very useful, I extend my gratitude to you. But if possible tell if we can have Doppler effect if both source and observer are at rest?",1
is this for igcse physics?,1
"If a car honks at me twice while coming to me, and twice when it passes me; would the time between honks be smaller when it is coming to me than it is moving away from me?",1
Why doesn't the pitch of the song on the radio go low when you drive away from the beacon? is it because speed is to slow to significantly affect wave of MHz frequency?,1
"Thank you Sir
My answer for that number 4(b) is 2674Hz, am I correct please?",1
Great video! Is there a case where the source is moving away and the observer going towards it? Would be interesting.,1
What if both Observer and Source are moving toward one another.. Anyone with an idea.. Or if both are moving away from one another,1
On the last problem why did the denominator had a negative sign?,1
"Wait?
I thought VS=+ if the Source if Moving towards the Observer

Why is the VS=- if the source is moving towards the Observer???",1
Why in problem 3 the speed of the source is negative ?! I mean it gets closer to the observer!!,1
who else is doing online classes and watching this minutes before test:),1
"Hey, how can you use that formula if at all we haven't been given the frequency for the observer and the source???",1
   how can I get it pls,1
"You're right if you kept the positive sign beside v observer and negative sign beside v source constant you get it ? 
They taught that way in class",1
And I'm afraid I'm going to finish all the maths that I need to study in the next decade in one lockdown year. Then what studies? Hahaha.,1

What would happen if there was torque slowing down angular speed. How would to find time it takes for angular speed to reach 0,1
"For the last example, how there is no external torque? Is not  the weight of the box pointing downward perpendicular to the rotating sarface? So Torque =Fr, which F=mg and r=distance from center to the box ?",1
If net torque is equal to zero then why isnt it at rotational equilibrim and have constant angulatlr speed??,1

"Hello JG, can you kindly assit us by adding more content of fluid mechanics especially the introductory part...you are awesome!😊",1
"hello sir! thank you for this simple yet understandable tutorial :) i have a question though, when an object is just at sea level (say, an automobile tire with given 24.2 psi) do i still need to convert the given gauge pressure to absolute?",1

i got a question.To calculate the gauge pressure why dont we consider too the weight of the water beneath that of oil?,1
why do we use aboluste pressure and not gauge pressure when the container is closed?,1
why do we use absolute pressure and not gauge pressure when the container is closed?,1
On example 5 where did the 101.3 come from?,1
where did u get the value of atm in roblem number 4,1
"wouldnt the height for question b be 15+8, not just 15? or that a depth of 15",1
For Question 5. How did you know Gauge pressure was using the oil and not the water? Is it because the oil is in contact with the atmosphere and the water isn't?,1
"Im confused by this video because at the beginning you describe the guage pressure as being the difference between a total pressure and the atmospheric pressure, but then further on you calculate the guage pressure of the water and oil but there is no mention of finding the difference from the atmospheric pressure. What am I missing, cheers",1
"Can I ask a question, what if the given in the last example is the specific gravity? How can I compute that, for example the Poil=.5 and the H20=50kg/m^3",1
"why don't you put all fluid mechanics related videos in one playlist , please",1
"Our teacher made us memorize a formula. PSI = Height in Inches x Specific Gravity / 27.7"" H2O. I'm not sure why though. Can you explain this formula??",1
Why did u calculate volume of cylinder in btw 4th example to find gauge pressure formulae..pls say...,1
"Why is the gauge pressure called the pressure ""above"" the atm pressure if it is the pressure ""inside"" the tank?",1
idk either :/ someone know?,1
So the pressure gauge formula is pgh?,1
7:26 why didn't he minus the 101.3 kPa?,1
why is Patm  101.3?,1
"at 10:16, how did you know that the weight of the atmosphere was 101.3 kpa? I thought this was for sea level. Did you just make that assumption? thanks",1
"for question number 4 i think he miscalculated the absolute pressure. it should be 502.25k + 101.3 = 502.35k.

"And how does it work for brass instruments? You can play different notes without changing the size of the tubes at all. The brass players call the different notes you can play without pressing keys ""harmonics"". By what i understand, you can, by changing the embochure, ""remove"" the lower harmonics, but i am not sure that's how it goes.",1
Cool. What about tension and standing wave relation in a string?,1
"I have a question!

I play the clarinet and the saxophone. On both instruments we do an exercise where we alter our embouchure to achieve different harmonics of a particular fundamental note without using the register/octave key. On clarinet, what the video says about closed pipe instruments only being able to achieve odd harmonics holds true. On the Saxophone, however, you can achieve every harmonic. 

To me, they both seem like they would be pipes closed at one end. Why does the saxophone act differently than the clarinet? Does it have to do with the saxophone being conical an the clarinet isn't?",1

"Editing seems to be a partial culprit here. Between sentences there is usually the video cut where the next sentence words start just a little too soon, before the listener has any processed/absorbed the prior sentence. She does speak quickly, but if the editing left a normal pause in between sentences, it would be much easier for myself and most people to absorb/learn what she is saying.

2) where delta_s = the vector between the bases of v1 and v2
THEN 
delta_s / R = delta_v / v
rearranging: delta_v = v * delta_s / R
dividing by time: a = delta_v / delta_t = v * (delta_s / delta_t) / R = v^2 / R

Inertia refers to how much force is needed to change the velocity of a body(higher mass -> more force), whereas the momentum is the product of the body's mass with its velocity, sometimes loosely referred to as its ""quantity of motion"". If the body is at rest it will have no momentum, but will still have intertia. Does that help?",1

Lets say you take 14 magnets modeled into a 3d Star of David, putting the + ends in the center of an orb using copper for obvious reasons. Would create a -only magnet.

Do the reverse to make a +only magnet.

Now if you take the Star of David literally and use one half + and the other half -, that would create a Neutral Magnet.

Or as Christians used the Chi-Rho.

Think about it ;) Then think what happens to an object in a neutral magnetic field. (Though the object may need to be able to be magnetized)",1

  Anyway, I am in question about the balloon problem. How I picture it.   If it were a ball it would have a more rigid structure.  It could, absent of any foreign influence, remain a ball. Thus allowing the air inside to be neutral to the air outside. Isn't this the viable situation needed, to be able to apply your formula?     The balloon, on the other hand, is completely limp and non-rigid when neutral until more and more air gets forced into it and is pressurized enough to form the ball shape which we can use your formula. But now the balloon has a positive air pressure. Wouldn't that create a need to know the psi of the balloon to get an accurate mass measurement?",1
Hello could you try this software?  Stumble Upon androidcircuitsolver on google,1
"This doesn't make sense to me you're calculating gravity by using  Substances such as air which have water molecules and water...... Air and water have a natural buoyancy.....

You cannot measure gravi because it doesn't existThe only way you can even think of measuring gravity is going outerspace and getting something big or small to measure the type of force which is placed on a object

Since we cannot do this and not even tried we cannot replicate gravity and since we cannot replicate gravity we can not say for sure if it exist in the 1st place

We know for sure even in space things can weigh-in have some mass to it but at that point we would need a force pushing down to measure it.....

It is one said when you are in the water are you wet when you're in it or wet when you come out

Same goes for gravi when you are in it is it I'll force or when you out of it is it forced on you

Everything gets pushed down equally but bigger things are heavier and smaller things are lighter the pending on the mass or the flatness

 A helium balloon rises and are Feather Falls where does gravi fit into this the balloon is wider in ways more then the feather but the air inside of it defeats gravity ????

Things done add up",1
"no no, the 'g' he used in mg is not referring to grams, but the acceleration due to gravity whose value is 9.8 m/s^2. The formula is Weight = Mass x Acceleration due to gravity. Which is Weight = Mass x 9.8 m/s^2",1

What would be the value in farad for to plate of 1 meter squared at distance of 1 mm? Then, inserting an isolator material that keep the plates at same distance, how much more farad we would get? Assuming the best or the cheapest material. Then, adding an electrolyte, how much more farad we typically get? Finally, making the plate ""bumpy"" to increase surface area, like in super capacitors, how much improvement we realistically expect?

   How's that exactly?,1
"   That doesn't answer the question I asked you. He uses the term ""something"" to refer to work. What is that ""something"" that he's referring to work?",1
"   I'll ask you the question that I asked to the other person. He uses the term ""something"" to refer to work in the beginning of the video. What is that ""something"" that he's referring to work?",1
"​   right, so published physics textbooks from, I presume, a well established university are all wrong and you're right? Do you have a source?",1
"​   I was referring to all Physics sources that embody the established concepts of mainstream Physics and not those sources that dispute these established concepts or say otherwise. Still, I know this is a bold statement and that's because the established concepts of Physics are incorrect. Can you dispute what I have stated to the other person in regard to the concept of work and energy based on established university textbooks and what is your argument?

It is accepted that an external force transfers energy to an object anytime that an external force acts on the object. After all, work on the object cannot be done if the external force doesn't transfer energy to the object. It only makes sense that a greater external force on an object then would transfer a greater amount of energy to the object. But, this would mean there's a relationship between the amount of external force on an object and the amount of energy transferred to the object. Can you dispute this based on your established university textbooks or do you have an argument against this?",1
"   why would I need to disprove that? there is a relationship between the amount of external force applied to an object and the amount of energy transferred to the object. When an external force is applied to an object, work is done on the object, which involves the transfer of energy to the object. The amount of work done on an object is directly proportional to the force applied and the distance over which the force is applied. Expressed in equation Work = Force x Distance

The unit of work is joules, which is the same as the unit of energy. Therefore, the amount of energy transferred to an object is also directly proportional to the force applied and the distance over which the force is applied. The more force that is applied to an object, the more energy will be transferred to it, assuming the distance over which the force is applied remains constant. In what source does it say otherwise?",1
"   You agree that an external force transfers energy to an object in the case that the object is not displaced, but the work equation would have that no energy is transferred by the external force when the object is not displaced because no work is done? How do you account for or explain this discrepancy?",1
"​   Sure, the equation is used to calculate the work done on an object when an external force acts on it and the equation shows that no work is done on an object if there is no displacement of the object that is caused by the external force. But, then there's the other aspect of work as it pertains to energy transferred. The work done on an object is the energy transferred to the object by an external force that is acting on it. The amount of work done on an object by an external force reflects the amount of energy transferred to the object. So, if you use the equation and it shows that no work is done on an object because the external force does not cause a displacement of the object then the equation would falsely show that no energy was transferred to the object by the external force. How do you account for this discrepancy that the equation would falsely show that no energy is transferred by an external force when the object is not displaced and that an external force transfers energy to an object that is not displaced?",1
   do you have an alternative formula?,1
"   You mean do I have an alternative equation for work? Of course, I do if that's what you mean and I have posted the equations all over Youtube videos comment sections. But, do you agree that this discrepancy is an issue or that it indicates that something is wrong?",1
"   that's fascinating, are you planning on publishing that in an academic journal?",1
"   Please do send the link to the paper when you publish it.

"The ""rate of change""? You don't speak with a respectably known language. You seem to have been creating new words for definitions that fit your concepts however you don't have any connection to the person who doesn't know anything yet. After all, the rate at which electricity flows is constant, as far as I've been told.  Frequency is  a constant, so how can you push the frequency any faster without changing it? So the rate of change to the direction of which the magnetic field is traveling or pointing relative to the charge traveling on its field, would be the frequency that makes up alternating current. 

Oh, and the more I think about it, shouldn't frequency of direct current be zero point five? You know, since it's half of the step to a complete sine wave? Sometimes, god gives you a sign? I think it's spelled sine. But who's able to claim godliness anyway when the word god is just that program in your head that dictates how you think, the fact that you do, and not much more? 

A kernel program.

Remember any electrical and magnetic energy is said to absolutely come for the energy input, we wouldn’t want to violate any of those special laws would we... 

So after we calculate the work - motor’s output and we have taken into account the electric energy input, then the remaining energy not converted to motor output is the core and copper losses 

THIS HAS NEVER INCLUDED CEMF which is always been described as  ‘the  generator effect’ as a result of Friday’s law of induction, & Maxwell-Faraday law, in maxwells equations  

Remember the generator effect can’t come from NO WHERE we are told that energy can’t be created anywhere in the universe 
so we have a problem the CEMF is not put into the equation from I/O

In motor data sheet why is this subject not  found in the losses table? along with - copper losses, core losses, bearing losses
Eddy losses, hys losses, stray losses...
The CEMF is used on data sheets only as you have - to find the running RPM - loaded and unloaded.

Please respond ))


See link below for full equation 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/motor-efficiency


This has been talked about for hundreds of years in alternative energy groups it’s not a new problem, but the fact remains the generator effect (breaking toque) in a electric motor is not accounted for as a loss, yet lol.., the motor is moving backwards and induction is happening. So therefore as many have said this is how a system can be actually measured over unity - over 100% for I/O when it is included 
After all it didn’t come from nowhere, if it came from the input (which it did) it must be measured on the output!",1

Just wondering why did you use 2/5mr^2 when describing the moment of inertia as opposed to mr^2? Is 2/5 a constant for spheres?,1
"Aaaa-khem. 

1) Coefficient of (static/sliding) friction has nothing to do with area of contact, but only material and conditions of the surfaces. So, given ring and box having equal materials, they would have equal coefficients, even if a ring have minuscule area of contact.

2) ""the moment the box slips"" makes no sense. The forces that drive the motion are gravity and the reaction of the ramp (also dependent on gravity). The gravity force is just constant, it doesn't increase or change.

Either gravity-induced downslope force is high enough to overcome static friction and then all objects slide, or its not, and then the box is not sliding at all (ring might slide or not - its called ""rolling resistance"").

There is no such coefficient of friction that would allow box sliding while the ring is forced rolling.

Think of it in this way, if you need an intuition. Any system is trying to achieve minimal energy state the most direct way possible. WHY, OH WHY would energy go into torque when sliding option is open for the ring?",1

"I would challenge the outcome of the Ramp Race. If there is no kinetic friction on the ENTIRE ramp, then I do not believe there would not be any source of energy (torque)  to rotate the marble or the ring. Hence the initial kinetic energy of the ring or marble would not be converted to rotational energy in the marble or the ring. Also since the only forces acting on all three objects, absent kinetic friction, would be ""g"" (gravity) and air resistance, I think the ring would win the race because  it offers a smaller surface area for air molecules to act upon (drag), ignoring the effects the race because  it offers a smaller surface area for air molecules to act upon (drag), ignoring the effects of laminar flow and potential vortices. thoughts?",1

"In circular motion,the magnitude of velocity doesn't change. Only its direction changes. Then why is there acceleration?",1

Can we fast forward to mechanical waves please,1
"What about inertia as the ""centrifugal force""",1
"I'm a bit confused, I always thought that the ""centrifugal"" would describe the inertia that makes the key fling out, when you let go of it and the centripetal is (like explained in the video) the force that keeps you in the circular motion. But the centripetal has to act against the inertia right? Is it purely a term-problem? Is it simply that what's trying to push you out is inertia and not an additional force and thats why it's wrong to call it ""centrifugal""? Since english is not my native language and I have never before studied anything related in english I might have some trouble clarifying the issue - would be glad for a verification!
TL;DR - Why can't I call the inertia of the object centrifugal? Is the issue calling it ""force""?",1
Who is this host? She's good!,1
How is the human centrifuge pulling you in when the force from the motor to spin you would by how I understand it be grater then the normal force the ride/walls is exerting to keep you in is why you feel stuck? I'm hung up on that. Knowledge is power just trying to learn.,1
PBS and SciShow are related? What does PBS means?,1
"what would happen if the rider was closer to the center, or actually in the centre",1
Could this be used to make artificial gravity,1
wait so the acceleration is always towards the center?,1

in what game did Link have a sling?,1
"Wait if the force that's acting upon you is perpendicular to the radius of the circular, is that not the centrifugal force? Also if there's a force pulling you into the center isn't there not an equal and opposite force pulling you outside?",1
"Geezy Pete's, has anyone ever been on a merry-go-around? Don't recall ever pulled towards the center. Explain that one.",1
"Did you know you can apply much of this to self defense? redirecting energy, angles circular moement all can be applied to self defense",1
Wouldn't we only find the period when the velocity is constant.. not the acceleration?,1
What about vertical circular motion??,1
That rubiks cube annoy anyone else?,1
where hank at?,1
but how is the change in direction counted as acceleration!,1
How will this help with my speeding ticket?,1
did you drive in a circle?,1
so what if we can travel faster then light?,1
Why is the force pointing to the center? If no object is in motion and you apply a force towards the center there will be no circular motion. If it is tangent to the circumference it would be accelerating and not constant circular motion. Where is this force? Is it between the center and the radius? I am so lost....,1
Is that Link from the legend of Zelda !,1
"So the centripetal force causes acceleration vertically to the velocity. this works all the time which causes the circular motion. Did I get this right?
And what is the source of the force? (What force is the cause of the centripetal force which is causd by the key being tied to the string)",1
The centrifugal force only exists if there's an observer to observe it? Which is why people call it fictitious?,1
"If i would jump tangently to the orbit of the chair that i am sitting on, i would fly away with the energy of between 50 and 120 J. Have i mistaken somewhere?",1
"did she say ""tossed about like a wet salad""?",1
So fictitious is just a missleading term? jeez,1
Wadwizard ZOL how tho the force doesn't exist,1
"lolPantsProductions 
That's not quite right. It only exists if you're in a rotating reference frame. Which is not an inertial frame.",1
"but also, why does it not exist. There is no prefered frame of reference",1
Doesn't this have to do with the conservation of angular momentum?,1
"If centrifugal force isn't real, how do centrifuges actually work?",1
if a car is moving in a zig zag staight path.. with constant speed .. can we say it is in uniform circular motion.,1
"I personally think centrifugal force is real.  It isn't the actor in the scenario, but it doesn't have to be to be a real force. The travelling body is exhibiting a force because of its otherwise linear inertia resisting the accelerating force.  Every force has an equal and opposite counter force. Centripetal force is the acting force. Centrifugal force is the inertial counter force to this acting force. Force, counterforce, I see no issue here. 

This also simplifies tidal mechanics. Why do physicists so complicate things just to get rid of the centrifugal force.",1
"I still dont understand why centrifugal force isnt real, isnt the tangential motion thing exactly that? The only reason that key stays there is because its attatched to a rope, and it stays at the end of the rope and the roap stays horizontal instead of falling limp is because the tangental forces push it outwards right? So there is a force going outwards, and on a carosel you stay on because you are sitting on somethg and/or holding on to a bar, if you stood on a spinning platform without anything to hold you once you reached a certain speed it would be a real struggle to stay on, because without anything pulling you in you body wants to follow the tangential force.

Similarly satelites have to go a certain speed to stay in orbit, too slow and gravity will pull them inward, but too fast and theyl break orbit.
So basically tangential force is hapening constantly as an object is being spun around a point pushing things outwards tangential to the circular motion...
whats the difference between tangential force and centrifugal force, and why is it real even though its fake?",1
A girl weighing 25 kg stands on the floor. she exerts a downward force of 250 N on the floor. what force does the floor exert on her give me answer,1
"But if the Centrifugal force is fictitious, they why doesn't water in  a bucket being spun around get pulled inward and spill out rather than pushed against the bottom of the bucket? Why does a child fly off one of those spinning fixtures of a playground if it doesn't hold onto the rails?",1
So. . . How many people make these videos?,1

Why don't you mention angular velocity?,1
Do you have any written version of this? hahahaha,1
"***** Again, 'real force' is not a thing. A force is an abstract quantity. Something either fits the definition of a force, or it does not. There is nothing 'real or not' about it. Saying that fictitious forces are not 'real' forces is a meaningless definition. To add to that, gravity is a fictitious force. Do you consider gravity to not be 'real'?",1
So does centrifugal force exist or nah?,1
why are pi's theta's etc imp I dont get it,1

"What is a resistor? How does current branch in a network of resistors? How does it ""know"" how much should flow in each branch?
While some detail is given in science and engineering courses about conductors, insulators and semiconductors, resistance is described in several ways.
Examples include i. The restriction to the flow of electrons. ii. The difficulty in moving electrical current through a conductor to which voltage is applied.
iii. a circuit element which dissipates energy in the form of heat .
More appropriate description for a resistor would be the property of a conductor which determines the current produced by a given difference of potential.
This makes us remember that a resistor is a conductor first. And, there is reason to say that superconductive wires dont obey ohm's law. So all conductors are resistive, though not superconductors.
Resistors are used in circuits to regulate the strengths of currents either by reducing the diameter of conductors or introducing more obstacles or lattice imperfections to reduce the strength of current.
The current branches in a parallel network by an elaborate rearrangement of surface charge.
Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science and not two, that of electricity and magnetism. 
It will be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level  as in the following two videos: 
i. https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo and 
ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo 
The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss details about resistance, how current branches in a parallel circuit and ohm's law.

How does current know how to split in parallel branches?
To answer this question one must know the role of surface charges in establishing a current and potential difference in a circuit. 
Supposing there is  a simple series circuit comprising a battery, wires and a resistor R1 and there is a dead-end branch with a resistor R2 across R1. When the circuit is made then initially electrons flow into both branches, but the surface of the dead-end branch becomes charged so negatively that no more electrons can enter. This prevents current flowing into the dead-end branch.
Current of appropriate strength will flow in the R2 branch when the branch is connected across R1. It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the rearrangement of surface charges which allows current through the branch.

The last frame References in video #1  lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss surface charges and explains their rearrangement with the help of sequential diagrams in parallel circuits.",1
"u need to get 0 W of total p, bcs of tellegen-theorm, dont u?",1

"You could also go into horizontally launched projectiles.

Let's say bob kicks a ball 10m/s on a 100m cliff 45 degrees. How far does it go?

 So the velocity in the y would be sin(45)*10m/s and the velocity in the x would be cos(45)*10m/s

y = 8.509m/s
x = 5.253m/s

Now that we have the velocity in the y (8.509m/s)
We will make a height vs time function.

The double antiderivative of -9.8m/s is -4.9x^2 so

-4.9x^2 + 8.5x + 100 = 0
now we use the quadratic formula(-b±√(b²-4ac))/(2a)

and get a result of: 5.4s

It will take 5.6 seconds to reach the bottom. Now we need to multiply this with the velocity in the x (5.253m/s) and we get our distance

D = 28.665M (5.6 * cos(45)*10m/s)",1

"Isn't this system one that's more dynamic? if the wheel has a radius of 2m, has an angular acceleration of 2.45 rad/s^2 and the string with tension is affixed to the rightmost point on the circle, then after that point rotates about 3.14 meters around the circumference (after about 2.5 seconds), wouldn't it be at the bottom? How would we be sure that the block would have that speed after 8 seconds if it could be traveling upwards against the force of gravity? Or is the string disconnected from the wheel immediately after pulling it down?",1

WHY ARE YOU YELLING,1
Who else here is in grade 11 physics,1
Do u know how to do specific heat or heat of vaporization and heat of fusion  I need help,1
Even at this time the video is very important 🎉Thanks man.Your didna great job.🎉🎉,1
"Hello, just for clarification.  example, why not include the sensible heat computation since the process required energy before melting the ice to latent heat?",1
"In a physics class, the instructor has assigned a task to determine an experimental value for the heat of fusion of ice. The students dry and mass out 26.8-gram of ice and place it into a coffee cup with 100.0 g of water at 36.4°C. They place a lid on the coffee cup and insert a thermometer. After several minutes, the ice has completely melted and the water temperature has lowered to 18.1°C. What is their experimental value for the specific heat of fusion of ice? What is the answer?",1
is there any video from a chemistry perspective covering the same topic?,1
29:50 isn't it supposed to be 27-21 not 27-20 since the water's initial temperature is 21 C  as given in the problem?,1
"but why exactly are we considering Qh as a negative value at 28:00, and how did you deduce the temperature changes at 29:30",1

Thermal capacity depends on which factors,1
6:28 how did you get 3.33 x 10 to the '5' J ?,1
isn't the value for the latent heat of fusion for ice 334 j/g only? i checked in the internet I don't know where it got the 3.33 x ^5,1
How can the ice be a water at 0celecius? It’s wrong (10:00min) for that exercise to covert the ice to water at different temperature we have two kinds of heat which are q=ml and a=mcdt just added them,1
in the calorimeter question you use 27-20c for the water. should it not be 27-21c or am I missing something?,1
Sir how to use T,1
ive watches so many of these videos and they never tell you how to find the latent heat of an unknown substance. Like for Q would you use the average heat or the change in heat during the phase change or the initial amount of heat? im so confused,1
Thanks man but why you have used 20C as an final temperature of water ?,1
"Felt like the value latent heat of fusion( 3.33 x 10⁵ ) is higher, but here it is saying latent heat of vaporization( 22.6 x 10⁵ ) is higher ?",1

i think you mad a mistake when you tried out the example of 7.5kg of ice. isn´t the latent heat of vaporisation supposed to be 2.26 instead of 22.6?,1
Is that 2000 or 2010,1

Hello first of all let me thank you because I learned a lot from you but in case i think you have a mistake on this sum .if you leave with 120volt and you subtract 4.616 and x10  comes 73.85v how come  the other side you have 55.38v ? the voltage total don't add up because if you leave with 120v you need to finish 120v right and 73.85+55.35=129.23 right and how can be u step up in voltage?

"Try to think of it this way: suppose the wheel is rolling forward (to the right). The wheel turns clockwise, from our perspective. As a point on the wheel closes in on the bottom of the wheel, its velocity vector that says it is moving around the center of the wheel points to the left. But the whole wheel (that point included) should also have a velocity vector directed to the right.

As a result of this, points that are in contact with the surface have a net velocity of the sum of -v_tangential and +v_translational. If the wheel is rolling ""without slipping,"" those speeds should equal one another in magnitude, and cancel out when adding them.

This also means that points at the top of the wheel are moving with speed 2v, and the points on the far left and right of the wheel are moving along the horizontal axis with just speed v.

Did that clear it up?",1

This is officially over my head. What is this video about?

It may be easier to understand if you look at the channel itself rather than at the video. ""CrashCourse"" is a business concept ... they have many different series of Crash Courses ... like ""Crash Course Economy"", ""Crash Course Psychology"", ""Crash Course Physics"", etc. (572 videos total).

The idea of ""compressed information"" have probably worked well for some of those courses ... based on the 4.5 million subscribers ... and now they assume that it will work for everything. I don't believe in the same idea.

So the video is about people trying to copy a ""success formula"" (their own formula or one they have got from others). It's about organized video production.

One comment identified it as ""edutainment"" ... about giving people the cognitive illusion of understanding the content. I believe he was talking about the general idea there.",1
"+CrashCourse Nick J.
More than half of the current comments are directly or indirectly about ""speaking too fast"".

* I pointed out that it may have been designed for a very specific group of people.

If it has, then I believe you should clarify that ... for example ""these physics crash courses have been specifically designed for students, and the intention is to cover [what the intention is?] in a short amount of time"".

But I had to guess. The idea that it could have been designed for specific groups of people was one of many guesses.

* It can also have been designed to be used in a specific way ... for example that the meaning is that people should start from ""Course #1"" and then work their way up to ""Course #11"" to get the full meaning.

* My third guess was that ""this has worked well for other crash courses ... 4.5 million subscribers and 572 videos"" ... that it was about people trying to follow some type of ""success formula"".

Can you clarify what the course is about ... the intended audience and the intended use of the courses?",1

What...?",1
"baby pancakes angular velocity is rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time. 

Say a minute hand moves five minutes from 12 to 1.
Hence, the angle displaced from 12 to 1  is: 1/12(360) = 30 degrees

So now we have angular displacement( the change in angle from a starting point, in this case the 12) 

Since angular velocity = d(theta)/dt, where theta is the angular displacement which we have found (30 degrees),

we now need to find the time. So how long does it take for the minute hand to move from 12 to 1? (5mins=300seconds) 

hence angular velocity , omega= rad/s

since 30 degrees is pi/6, therefore 

angular velocity = (pi/6)/300secs",1

Okay, then gravity isn't a force either. It's a consequence of geometry. Are you going to get upset if someone calls gravity a force at any time after like 1920? I guess electricity and magnetism aren't forces either, because they're actually quantum field interactions. You're mixing different levels of physics together, which you shouldn't do. What formalism do you want to use? Classical mechanics or statistical mechanics? Pick just one. Forces aren't real. We made them up. If someone wants to invent a force called friction, they can do that, and we actually see it. If it causes a change in acceleration, it's a force.",1
"to break this down to its most basic and simplest of components. the only question which will give an accurate answer to my confusion is. If you push on a stationary object such as a wall in a strait line to the flat surface. is that called friction. if not than friction is not itself a force because its the exact same principles which gives objects ""Friction""",1
"+crystal kalem 
I'm not sure what you mean to be honest. Do mean wether  intermolecular bonds within the wall perpenticular to your direction of pushing and the friction between wall and floor are the same thing? 
Tbh. in the end it doesn't matter. A ""force"" is already an abstraction of the real world. It's a modell. It's up to you what you define as a force, as long as the outcome is right :)
Or to put it this way: A force, as well as velocity, acceleration (and others) are vectors. Which means they not only have a quantity (such as 10N), they also have direction. (Thats why she always draws arrows, this wouldn't make much sense with weight for example).
Now go and find a vector in nature. It's not possible. You will never have a 2-dimensional something in nature.",1

"Sir Isaac Newton. One of the greatest physicists ever who said: “If I have seen further, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants”.  We know about Isaac Newton very well, but we do not recognize the ‘Giants’. We are aware of the famous picture of Isaac Newton, where he is seen experimenting with light. But we are not aware that the same experiment was done by Ibn al-Haytham more than seven centuries before him.

Muslim scientists such as Thabit ibn Qurra and Ibn al-Haytham wrote about calculus. We know of Ibn al-Haytham and his writings about gravity. Abu Bakr al-Razi, centuries before Newton, made a strong distinction between absolute and relative space; absolute space, which is three dimensional and infinite, exists quite independently of the bodies contained in it. And Ibn Sina tried to relate velocity with weight, which is a precursor to the concept of momentum. These discoveries are all connected to Newton.


Let’s look at Newton’s laws of motion. Ibn Sina and Ibn al-Haytham, among others, are seen to be writing about Newton’s law of inertia, the first law of motion. Abul Barakat Al-Baghdadi writes that force is proportional to acceleration, which we get to know from the second law. Ibn Bajja wrote that for every force there is a reaction force, which became the forerunner to Newton’s third law of motion.

So how do so many things that Newton worked come to light as being described by Muslim scientists long before his discoveries?

The ‘Giants’ they say, are Copernicus, Kepler, Descartes, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo. But actually, it just might be that Sir Isaac Newton was influenced by Muslim scientists.

ADVERTISE ON TMV

In his writings, there are clear marks of influence from Ibn Tufail’s philosophical romance Hayy ibn Yaqzan (Alive Son of Awaken). It is known that both the Latin and English translations of the book by Edward Pococke and Simon Ockley  were available at Isaac Newton’s time. Ibn Tufail’s influence is seen in other philosophers, scientists, and fiction authors of the time too.

The talented man he was, Ibn al-Haytham’s name is frequent. Isaac Newton even kept a copy of Ibn al-Haytham’s magnum opus, Kitab al-Manazir in his personal library.

Many laugh at Jabir ibn Hayyan for his alchemy, considering it irrational. Jabir ibn Hayyan didn’t try to create gold out of silly stuff without a system; rather his process was more scientific and experimental. Many people in fact, get shocked when they find out that Sir Isaac Newton also practiced alchemy. And, he didn’t only practice alchemy, he read Jabir’s book and was influenced by it. A book called Summa Perfectionis was based on the Arabic work Kitab al-Mulk, from the Jabirian Corpus. It was translated into English by Richard Russell, and appeared in three other versions, one of which was Willam Starkey’s Secrets Reveal’d, the one which Newton owned.

So, perhaps, Newton’s ideas didn’t fall from an apple tree after all. Perhaps they fell from the great minds of Muslim scientists before him.

in relation to the laws of physics with a round disk full of information.
I will try to explain what I mean. A record will turn at a set speed say 45 RPM.
how can the center or near center turn at the same speed as the outer perimeter and arrive back to the start at the same time as the outer?
Or let say if you walked around the inner circle of your town at 12 miles per hour
from a starting point and at the same time someone else walked around the outer circle of your town
at the exact speed 12 miles per hour who would have completed the walk first.
I think logic would say, well you would because you had less distance to walk as you were on
the inner circle. I hope you're still with me? So now if you place a record on a turntable
and drew a white line from the center to the outer edge then switch on the rotation at 45 RPM the inner circle will arrive back at the starting point the exact same time as the outer circle.? how can this be possible.

"In a circuit, will a capacitor fully discharge itself before it will be recharged again?  If not, how do we know when the capacitor will be charged or discharged?",1
"But once the capacitors charged, why cant the electrons moving in the middle where the bulb is keep moving?",1
can you run out of charge while charging capacitors in series ? are all the capacitors fully charged and have the same voltage difference as the battery?,1
In battery the electrons move from low to high potdntial but here the electrons move from high to low inside battery. Isnt that wrong??,1
"Hello everyone, Questions! wouldn’t one plate of the capacitor be left at neutral since one side didn’t get a connection directly from the source? How does it become - or + charged if one plate didn’t have the voltage source to feed or absorb electrons from its plate ?",1

i still dont understand. the electrons cant go through the insulator but can jump over the capacitor?,1
   how does it make the electron positive?,1
And why the author didnt mention that neat detail in a  11 minute video?  ,1
So current flow stops when the caps are fully charged...light bulb goes off. Then then caps discharge and current flows again...light bulb turns on. How fast is this process happening? Is the bulb therefore flashing? Sorry I'm a NOOOOOOB!!! 😵,1

They were solved by substituting .5 for t. Was this a mistake or am I not understanding the approach to solving the second part of the problem?",1
what a legend,1
sir @ 44:37 why did you use 0.4 and not 0.6? isn`t 0.6 the max value of x?,1
 why don't we take amplitude by adding 0.4 & 0.2 since amplitude is equal to the max displacement,1
"Quick question:  the velocity is positive (+6.124 m/s) and slightly later on the found acceleration is negative (-150 m/s^2   Both are vectors, correct? So why isn't the velocity negative as well (since it's traveling to the left)?",1
"Same here. I was to confused when he put the value of x which is 0.5 as t. 
Shouldnt we use the given equation for x then put x = 0.5 then solve for t and then use that value of t for the veloctity and acceleration?",1

"46:27 what happens to the gravitational acceleration when you say max acceleration is 4.9? Shouldn't it be 4.9+9.8 when it is above the equilibrium point?

So should max velocity be different?",1
"He wasn't calculating speed at equilibrium point.
note that the spring was compressed {to the left}. due to the compression, the spring gains some energy. when the applied force used to compress the spring is then removed, the energy in the spring will be converted to the kinetic energy of the mass


hence, mechanical energy equals kinetic energy


did this help??",1
What is the formula for finding the mass of object that is hunged on the oscillating spring,1
"55:43, it seems that we solved for the maximum velocity here. Why would we find the maximum velocity when it asks for the velocity right after the block is released? Isn't the maximum velocity at equilibrium point? If it is right after we release it, it would not be at equilibrium..?",1
Hello. Sorry but why are we unable to get the value of x when we input the force and the spring constant into the Hooke's law equation? Or is that just me?,1

"At 1:02:09, it is stated that T = 2πA/V, and by manipulation, we can obtain T = 2π√(m/k). What confuses me is that in the context of the period, we typically use the linear velocity (v) that tracks the cycle. So why is it equivalent to Vmax?",1

"at 47:26, when he's solving for potential energy, why doesn't he take into account gravitational potential energy?  since the spring is vertical, wouldn't PE = PE of spring + PE gravitational?",1
"I have a question about the problem that starts with: A 0.55kg block vibrates according to the equation x=1.5cos(12.4t)...

When we come to calculating the velcoity and acceleration when x=0.5 why did the plug 0.5 into the equations for t? 

It says x=0.5, doesn't that mean x(t)=0.5=1.5cos(12.4t) which implies t=5.687
So then wouldn't we plug 5.687 into the equations for v(t) and a(t)?",1

what is the displacement of object in SHM when kinetic and potential energies are equal?,1
"Sorry but when they say it is stretched 30 cm from its natural position do they not mean before it came to equilibrium? So that would mean that the 30 cm would be from its position from the factory to the equilibrium position, is that not so?",1
"0.5 is x ,why did you sub the value into t?",1
"You are a tremendous help. However, at 55:00 the exercise problem that you are solving, you mention that mechanical energy is equal to kinetic energy when the spring is released from compression. What about Potential Energy? Doesn't the spring also lose Potential Energy gradually? You have stated that Mechanical Energy=Kinetic Energy. Shouldn't it be Mechanical Energy=Kinetic Energy +Potential Energy?",1

"hmmmm, it may be just me, but ;-) at 1:49:00 your answers for part b doesn't seem right because ... the question was asking for acceleration and velocity at ""position x=0.5"".

"+Herbert Cringeworth Actually, I think you're completely wrong on this. KA does teach the substance of the subject very well. I like you, also dislike it when people teach methods of getting through things without having the student understand the reasoning behind it, and I hate it due to a personal experience. If anything the old way of learning does, is exactly that. Methods of hoping through without making you think critically. Khan Academy has taught me so much and let me understand a bunch which more importantly, has stuck with me all through out my life and if at some point I do forget due to not using it, I simply can reason through the logic of it all over again.

Thanks for making this Topic easy so now I understand were I am going. Keep the good work,1
How did you make this topic so easy? You're on another level,1
"Just before 42:06 we use calculated voltage and observed current to calculate resistance, but doesn't the coil have reactance that needs to be considered?The magnetic field is changing so why isn't the term impedance used rather than resistance? Or is impedence only applicable when the voltage source is external, rather than magnetically induced current in a coil?",1
i keep on hearing electric flux lol. seems thats your favorite physics topic,1
I always use the screwing bottle cap rule to figure the direction of the magnetic field generated by the current. In wich way do you have to turn the cap to go in the way of the current? If you turn it to right it will go into the page and so on. Pretty cool rule if you ask me.,1
"THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!! What you do is a service to the world brother I have been racking by brain for 2 days trying to figure some of this stuff out with an AARL handbook to no avail my brain feels like jelly and you just dropped gold in my lap. Any good books that you would recommend on further study of Electromagnetics, Chemistry, Math and Engineering?",1
In example 2 : What is the Area?. did we need it?,1
"so if the current, magnetic field, area decreases, the magnetic flux decreases and the circuits supports it to make up for that reduction?",1
"Many times you say electric flux, shouldnt it be magnetic flux?",1
Any tips for physics 2 tests? I have one tomorrow and I swear I'm gonna fail.,1
"For the example at 15.33,which values would be needed to calculate the value of emf induced.Can someone please clarify?",1
What does (into the page) mean exactly!?,1
Would you not divide the change in B over the change in time in order to find the change in flux as well? 38:13,1

how do you determine what side the center is on at 25:00 how can you tell that the center is on the left...im pretty sure its a simple concept but I'm so lost in figuring this out,1
"What do you mean when you talk about the coil of wire being on the right side  in the video? Since it is into the page on the right side of the wire, how does that cause the external field to be out of the page?",1
How about rotating from left to right a magnet inside a coil?? Will it produce electricity or not?,1
For question one part C was the answer negative or positive?,1
Yeah I havemt been able to figure that out either. Is that wire in the center of the coil? Or is it on the left of the coil? God knows other than the guy because the guy first says the wire is in the center of the coil and then he says the coil is on the right of the wire. How can something be in the center and to the side of something at the same time?,1
CAn you also use Fleming left hand rule instead?,1
where does it come from e=bl2w/2?,1
"what I don't get about lenz's law: How can a coil reduce or strengthen the magnetic field, when there is always one line in each direction (on each of its sides). Don't they cancel out? Why do we seem to only look at the center of the spool even if the source of the field is outside?",1

at 51:53 how do you know it's cos 30 - cos 70 and not the other way around?,1
how does he know the direction of B induced by the magnet?,1
"I watched this video last night and I thought it was confusing. Today I did some research and it seems like you could just say the following, ""When current goes through a wire it creates a magnetic field. If you cut off the power, the collapsing magnetic field creates a voltage, that wants the current to keep going the same direction. Since it wants to keep going the same direction, the change in current turning off is a gradual change. Since coils create a bigger magnetic field, a bigger inductor makes the change in current flow slower."" Isn't that the same thing?",1
"I'm confused.
When the velocity or force direction and magnetic field density direction are provided? 
Which hand 🖐 🤚 should I use to determine the direction of the current?

Based on other youtube videos Left hand is used for induction.

You used right hand for the same manner.",1
You said the power dissipated by the coil. Why dont you say the power introduced by the coil sence we produce a volts and amps in the coil. I mean this is the principle of electrical generators (electromagnetic induction). We want to introduce power from the generatores not the opposite im i right?,1

"I can try to solve my solution:

F = (kq1q2) / r2
F = (N/m2c2 x c x c) / m2
F = (N/m2 x c2 x c x c) / m2
F = (N/m2 x c4) / m2
F = (N x 1/m2 x c4) x 1/m2
F = N x 1/m2 x c4 x 1/m2
F = N x 1/m4 x c4
F = (N x c4) x 1/m4
F = (N x c4) / m4

The final answer is F = (N x c4) / m4. Is it true?

"Scientists are the problem. They are considered mainstream only if their theories are based on phenomena. 
Example: Gravity is considered a phenomenon. It is considered a phenomenon because we cant explain it. Because it doesn't work and it doesn't exist. If it did exist, we would certainly have discovered it by now. However, instead of making the Logical conclusion that we need a real Force. We continue for 200 years with this force. Gravity does not even explain Gravity.  Lot alone anything else in our universe. 
We do not correct the error. What we do is add another phenomenon to explain the first phenomena such as dark matter. Then when that failed they created another phenomenal dark energy. 
That is science now?
You cannot use a phenomenon to explain the phenomenon that explains phenomena.

in relation to the laws of physics with a round disk full of information.
I will try to explain what I mean. A record will turn at a set speed say 45 RPM.
how can the center or near center turn at the same speed as the outer perimeter and arrive back to the start at the same time as the outer?
Or let say if you walked around the inner circle of your town at 12 miles per hour
from a starting point and at the same time someone else walked around the outer circle of your town
at the exact speed 12 miles per hour who would have completed the walk first.
I think logic would say, well you would because you had less distance to walk as you were on
the inner circle. I hope you're still with me? So now if you place a record on a turntable
and drew a white line from the center to the outer edge then switch on the rotation at 45 RPM the inner circle will arrive back at the starting point the exact same time as the outer circle.? how can this be possible.

uhh is a moose a reindeer?,1
"Let's sum up the forces exerted ON each of the objects, ok? Take the sled first: you have gravity, the normal force from the ground, and the pull of the reindeer. But the normal force cancels out gravity, and the only uncanceled one is the pull, so the sled accelerates forward.
noe lets condider the reindeer: gravity and normal force cancel out, but then you have the pull from the sled pulling it back, and the reaction force the it gets from the ground as it pushes backwards with its hoofs. If it pushes backwards on the ground, then the force from the ground will push it forwards. However, you still have the  sled pulling the reindeer back.
So the effectice forces on the reindeer ate the pull from the sled and the push from the ground. To move forward, all the reindeer needs to do is push back on the ground with more force thab the sled pulls it back.
There is one force we haven't considered though. What are the effects on the ground of the push that the reindeer makes? Certainly if it pushes backwards on the ground, and there is nothing to cancel it out, the ground must move backwards. And it does! it's just that the Earth is so massive, it barely ecen notices that tiny push.",1

c.) The Moon is approximately 3.8 x 10^5km from Earth. At its final speed, how long will it take the rocket to reach the Moon? 



d.) The star nearest to us, called Alpha Centauri, is 4.1 x 10^13 km away. Could this rocket get a man to Alpha Centauri before he dies of old age?



e.) The rocket is half way to the Moon when its pilot suddenly notices he forgot his camera!

And if there are three significant digits, would the true velocity range be 200.1 *(1±0.005) or 200*(1±0.005)? I would imagine that 0.5% is also an estimate too, which only has three significant digits.

Is magnetic field of solenoid independent of the cross-sectional area of the solenoid?",1
"If the magnetic strength is always in relation to the number of turns per meter, then it seems like increasing the number of turns of wire would have no effect on the strength of the magnet. Assuming the diameter of the wire is unchanged and it can't be coiled any tighter, then increasing the number of turns will increase the length proportionally and they will cancel out. In your example, N=1,500 and l is 5cm, so n=30,000, but if N doubles to 3,000, then l will also double to 10cm and n is still 30,000 and the magnetic force doesn't change. How can this be right?",1

why would the field outside the solenoid be zero?,1

Thank you for the comprehensive explanation. I have a question regarding your solution of (b). I did not get the whole explanation of multiplying the change of time by the change in flow rate to get the change of mass. Why did not you simply multiply the 106 by 600 (10 minutes) and you will get the same solution 63 600 as simple as this. I would love to know your justification,1

"So, 
1. Electric field inside a conductor is zero.
2.. A capacitor works by creating an electric field between 2 oppositely charged plates.
3. When u place a positive charge inside a conductor, The electric field at the centre of the conductor is still zero. But there is an electric field between the centre and the negatively charged shell. Moreover, the entire conductor surface is now positively charged and generates an electric field to the outside...
Okay, so I guess when I put a negative charge at the centre of a positively charged conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, charges are rearranged so that the conductor is now negatively charged.
Well,what happens if I put a negative charge at the centre of a negatively charged conductor?",1

If you're including professional and college courses, then you're back to my original problem.

Statistics, Trigonometry, Algebra, Calculus, geometry, etc all get used. The relationship between calc and stats, or between trig and linear, or even between geometry and ODEs are pretty interesting, but not something that could be covered by a crash course.

Once again, we're talking about the functional equivelant of doing a crash course science. Obviously they aren't going to do that.

How about a crash course Algebra, or crash course Calculus?",1
"Thanks! The production value is great. However:

At 05:00 you say that there is an isothermal process where heat is slowly added, but the animation shows lots of heat (Q_H) escaping. What gives?

At 05:04 You say that the isothermal expansion is 1/2 AB. Shouldn't it be the entire path AB?
 
At 05:15 you say ""the temperature drops whilst the heat stays constant, which also makes the volume expand"". Well this is misleading: a temperature drop would cause an isolated system volume to contract. However in a Carnot engine, the system is doing work on the atmosphere, converting internal energy into work, and dropping the temperature. It's best to say that the expansion work drops the temperature, not that a colder temperature causes an expansion.

Also, when you keep saying ""the heat stays constant"", shouldn't you be saying ""there is no heat flow"" or something equivalent?

At 05:40 you say ""the heat doesn't change"" but perhaps you should be saying that there is no heat flow, or the system is thermally insulated, or something else equivalent.

The way you explain it sounds as if heat is a state property, when it's not.",1

"A CONSIDERATION. 
11:00 min
Action/ REACTION 
Note how 100 newtons of applied force becomes experienced by both sides, in effect BECOMING doubled. 
100 newtons creates 200 newtons, 
100 per party. 
Where did the extra 100 newtons come from?
It could well be that it is wrong, albeit consistently wrong, and that each body, in fact experiences only 50 newtons each. 
Objectively, nothing changes, SUBJECTIVELY our   numbers are off by 50%.
Think about it. The values are just numbers which, in and of themselves mean nothing. 
Rather it is our experience of the numbers that COUNTS. 
Ie. When you go to the gym and pump some iron, you experience the values that we quantify as numbers. 
What is the difference if you designate a weight as 100 or 1000 X? Which, nevertheless changes the instant you travel to another planet with a different gravity rating. 
What COUNTS is our experience, 
how heavy or light it FEELS when we experience it. We use the numbers to QUANTITY our SUBJECTIVE experience.

it is cos(ø) because it's the angle away from the perpendicular line instead of the from the plane?,1
"Can some one please explain why a charge located outside a box shaped surface area produces zero net flux? I cannot seem to make sense of this because if the electric field decreases in magnitude with increasing distance from the source, won't the electric field lines leaving the surface have less magnitude than the ones entering it, which leads to a greater flux inwards than outwards?

"Hey guys, I have a genuine and frustrating problem I'm trying to figure out so I can start to model. ---How is just the exhaust sound from a car come from? (Yes, i know feom the individual explosions that are happening inside the combustion chamber, but its more complex). Also, why if your not in the right gear going up hill, and even tho your RPM hasn't changed, as you give it more gas,  the engine note changes. ( besides the obvious answer because you're giving it more gas there's a more complex answer). And finally, what makes a Ferrari V8 sound SO different that a Chevy or Ford V8, excluding size and exhaust layout.  I have an hypothesis. We will focus on one cylinder of an Engine of your choosing.  Engine takes in air and fuel, its compressed to around 120psi, ignition, rise and heat are produced and the piston gets pushed down, ( (very simple introduction). However , as the piston is at bottom dead center and before the exhaust valve opens, there still remains a calculatable pressure that remains.  Due to a volume of air now hotter than originally, there is still pressure inside the chamber. When the exhaust valve opens, rapidly even at idle and the piston is thruster upward, thoes hot exhaust gases, as hot as 50psi, are forced into the exhaust system and out the tailpipe. Now 50psi being forces out a narrow tube in ,even as low as .06 sec, is bound to ""carry a tone""  what do u think",1

The question to ask is a little different: is the red-shift because of the expansion of space, or because it's actually moving relative to us? This is not binary, of course... we know the local galaxies are approaching us because of our gravity (and determined by the blue-shift), just as some of the red-shift is from the expansion from the ""big bang"" itself.

"What is electric current?

What is electric current? Electrons flow in a conductor?

How do electrons flow in a conductor? Like many cars driving down the highway? Or is water flowing in warer pipe? What is a highway in a conductor? What is the water pipe in the conductor? Why don't electrons flow to the positively charged nucleus? What magic keeps electrons away from the nucleus?

Is the speed of electrons flowing in copper wire the speed of light? If not, how could electricity travel at the speed of light? If so, how can electrons accelerate at the speed of light?

In fact, Atoms are not made from charged particles as scientists told. 

All atoms consist of indestructible, electrically charged multiple layers hollow sphere and internally charged solid sphere. Outside each atom is a layer of negatively charged liquid that scientists mistaken for electrons.

This negative charged liquid attaches to non-metal atoms due to their outer layer is positively charged and floats on metal atoms due to their outer layer is negatively charged. The floating liquid of a conductor conducts electricity.

Electricity is flow in conductor 
instantaneously, similar to hydraulic fluid flow through hydraulic systems. 

The voltage of the electricity is proportional to the speed at which the floating liquid moves.",1

For example: acceleration needs an initial point and a point to which you want to compare. How much did the the vehicle accelerate from 30mph to 40mph. Vectors use scalars to work.

On the other hand: speed needs one point and compares relative to zero. The man walked 10mph. 10mph is 10mph from zero. You could say the man ran 5mph faster than he walks, but you are still starting from as your initial speed you are adding to is referenced from zero.",1

everyone wants to enjoy themselves with theory and hypotheticals, but i live in the really real world, and at some point you must take your tools and face actual matter and energy in our attempts to get it to behave in the manner in which we desire.  and when we fail we make adjustments accordingly to either fix or go back to theory and start over.

But a practical moment of inertia is a sum that could hardly get finished and also this youtube formula appears to fit a rod of negligible radius.  You can tell from a Serway schoolbook that a FAT rod is going to deserve another formula and if you are also going to attach a big disk to it somewhere then the formula for that is going to be a sum that has both your rod and also your disk in it.

Another outstanding video discussing all variations on the calculations and how to cross check the answers. However I wish that he would elaborate more on a couple points about when he said that the current leads the voltage in a circuit with a capacitor and the current lags the voltage in a circuit with an inductive element. What does that mean exactly? That the sine wave for one or the other is pi/2 further along the graph? Also what is the lead/lag relationship between current and voltage in a circuit that has both and inductor and a capacitor? Does it depend on the characteristics of each element in terms of units of Henry's?🤔,1

"How does a voltage develop across the unconnected end of a single wire connected to one terminal of a battery and the other terminal? 

If the battery’s net charge is zero, then for a 12 V battery, one terminal would be at a potential of +6 V with respect to a conductor at infinity, while the other terminal would be at –6 V. At the physical center in the space between the two terminals of the battery, the voltage is zero.
If we then connect a small wire to, say, the positive terminal, a few excess point charges will move onto the wire, and that wire will now be at the same potential as the battery terminal: +6 V. The wire will be surrounded by an e-field, and since the lines of electrostatic flux must always terminate upon charges, the wires must possess an excess surface charge. 

In the above we assumed the net charge of the battery was zero. Supposing that the battery had a net charge. Then how would the charges, potentials and voltage be changed? 

Before we answer this, it would be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level.
Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two as in the following two videos:
i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and 
ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo 

Returning to our question of the voltage of the single wire connected to one battery terminal,  we assume the net charge of the battery was not initially zero. Perhaps someone with rubber-sole shoes carried the battery while walking on a wool carpet or perhaps the battery was charged to –5000 V, and would deliver a tiny spark if touched. In that case one terminal would still be 12 V different than the other terminal, perhaps –5000 V on the positive terminal and –5012 V on the negative. 

It is not possible in this brief post to discuss in more detail the process of production of the voltage of the single wire without a detailed discussion of the capacitance and potential of single conductors.
The last frame References in video #1  lists textbook 4 which discusses these topics comprehensively using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of voltage of a single short and long wire with and without a net charge on the battery.",1

In my class, I prefer to say that PE is energy a system has due to its: a) position (GPE); b) configuration (e.g. compressed/stretched spring); or c) composition (nuclear/internal chemical energy). That way, it is certainly distinct from kinetic energy.

"*THE EXACT PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE CREATION OF THE WIRE'S MAGNETIC FIELD*

Current flow does not cause the magnetic field creation.  Not in the way people think.

In a 12 gauge copper wire (2mm diameter), at 1 amp, a single electron moves  only 
0.000023 meters per second.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity#Numerical_example

I'm going to figure out the exact physical nature of the magnetic field around the wire.  A couple things stand out:

1)  there are no electrons flowing down the wire.  How long will it take one electron in a 1 amp, 12 gauge wire to move one meter?  
Distance = Rate x Time.   
1 meter = .000023 meters/second  x  Time.
Time =   1 meter /  .000023 meters/second = 43,478 seconds = 742.64 minutes =  12.1 hours

""But that's just one electron.  There's millions of electrons.  You forgot about that.""  
No.  Every electron is traveling slower than frozen molasses,  .000023 meters/second, 1 meter in 12.1 hours.

So moving electrons do not create the magnetic field.  The magnetic field appears INSTANTLY the moment power is turned on (speed of light, just like the electric field) and the electrons are taking 12.1 hours to move only one meter.

And it's not the random movement of electrons either - the magnetic field around the wire would be random in that case, and the field is not random.

2)  the orientation of the (rotating) magnetic field around the wire is the same every time - right hand rule.

3)  it is a north magnetic pole - every time power is on.  
      
I'm starting there.  The suspicion is that the field gradient is part of the reason for the consistency of the magnetic pole being north consistently.",1

by putting I1 = 2I2 in the statement 
it's going to be 2 i2 + i2 is equal to 6
that means 3 * i2 is equal to 6

Water is flowing through a pipe of two circular cross-sectional area A1 and A2 lying at a height difference of 25 cm.

pls tell me",1

Suppose we have a 5V battery connected to a wire.. and how do battery give 5j of energy to electrons that are present in a conductor,1
4:32 how to increase the voltage/current?,1
Can you tell  solveig how battery generate electric field ?,1
Did you find out the answer?,1
" this is pretty late, but if you're still wondering how to get 5 J from a 5V battery here you go.

If you know how many volts you have and you want to know how many joules of energy your circuit is using it also requires knowing the resistance of the circuit and the time.  

Let's simplify your question by saying you have a 1 V battery and want to know what conditions would supply 1 J of energy.

1 Joule of energy (E) is dissipated by using 1 watt of power (P) for 1 second (t); E=P×t

1 Watt is the amount of electrical work performed when 1 ampere of current (I) flows across a potential difference of 1 volt (V). P=I×V

1 Ampere is equal to 1 volt over a resistance (R) of 1 ohm; I=V/R.

By substituting you can combine these formulas into one:
I=V/R and P=I×V therefore P= V^2/R.
P= V^2/R and E=P×t therefore E=V^2×t/R.

So, in order for a 1V battery to supply 1J of energy, it has to be connected to a circuit drawing 1 amp of current across a 1 ohm resistor for 1 second.  

If you want a 5 volt battery to supply 5 joules,  you have to change the values of the resistance and/or time so that the math in the formula E=V^2×t/R comes out to be 5 joules. For example, 5 volts across 5 ohms for 1 second, 5 volts across 10 ohms for 2 seconds, etc.

Why 3 hours 😭😭,1
Why tf would our science teacher give us a g9 lesson to g7,1
This make anyone else hungry?,1
"I suppose the best that can be said about this video is that the presenter paid close attention in his science classes and faithfully memorized all the material the teacher(s) presented. Unfortunately, it's also obvious that he's not given so much as one minute of thought at to what he's parroting back from those classes.

This explanation of sound fails at such a cursory and basic level that it's both a crime and a sin that it's allowed to be taught this way in schools. Students deserve better.

This comment will outline just a couple of the many errors in the teaching of sound. For simplicity only sound in air will be considered.

The notion of sound as alternating compressions and rarefactions being ""pushed out"" by a sound source leads to a question that must be asked (but, never is). Why don't those compressions (air particles being pushed closer together) and rarefactions (air particles being...somehow...made to be further apart. Just how not being explained) can persist in the air for at least several seconds, without diffusing and fading out within a few feet at most?

After all, it you create a fairly massive rarefaction by sucking air into your lungs and taking it out of the immediate atmosphere and then making a compression by blowing the air out. How long do those rarefactions and compressions persist when blowing out the candles on a birthday cake? Or blowing out the candles (or at least trying to blow them out) from 5 feet away?

How much compression and rarefaction is there from a vocal cord moving perhaps a few thousandths of an inch for even loud talking or yelling. 

How does the sound take off at the speed of sound (standard conditions about 760 mph) when the vocal cords are moving at typically less than one mph? You seem proud to be a math whiz' calculate the speed of something you can fairly easily measure, like the motion of a loudspeaker cone.

You must at least get it that a loud sound from a vocal cord or loudspeaker requires it to move faster than with a soft sound. The 'device' moving a greater distance in the same amount of time for the same pitch or frequency of sound when the sound is louder.

If the sound source is moving at different speeds (both due to loudness but also from harmonic content), why don't the rarefactions and compressions run into each other and muddle up the sound? How is it that even from a considerable distance, sound can retain that harmonic content, making the sound easily recognizable?

Some of these questions were asked in a video I made. But, the purpose of the video was not to teach science but to get permissions from Caltech for use of some of their copyrighted material. You can see the video here:

https://youtu.be/4kTLMiGgnqs

What is the mechanism for the sound taking off at 760 mph from less than a 1 mph emitting surface?

The teaching of sound in school science classes is just one fairy tale after another.

One of those fairy tales is the Decibels. The notion that sound is emitted as energy and thus must follow an inverse square law falloff rate. When, even the most obtuse moron can clearly tell that it doesn't, the mathematical physicist still continues to unmercifully beat that dead horse with the mathematics of logarithms, and coming up with the most ridiculous answers and presenting them with a straight face:

https://youtu.be/R5rkg8mTRBI

I guess my advice would be to actually think this issue of sound through...at least a little bit...before making a 3 1/2 hour video about it.

"i have a question,.since U and.PE.are connotations for.potential energy, why do they yield.different.results? i tried solving the potential energy for.each capacitor by using two equations pe=qv, and U=1/2cv2, but they yield different results. Correct me if there are errors in what I did. Pls help. Why is it that the result of U is always half of the result of PE when they should have the same answer.",1

"why the fuck does the capacitor with the most capacitance gets the lowest voltage of the three???
is it because the first one in series always gets the most??
shit

and thank u btw for these videos",1
