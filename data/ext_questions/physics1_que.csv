From this parameter can i calculate the power ?",1
"Hi, I am busy with a personal projects.
I am busy with special gearing which allows me to use a driver gear which is 50mm in diamater that drives the follower gear which is 100mm in diameter. I have them running the same rpm. Now I just want to know if there will still be more torque on the follower gear (100mm) than there would be on the driver gear (50mm). Remember that all my tests the system is the same rpm. Does the follwer gear consume less energy as the rpm is not 2:1 as it should be for a equal system?",1
"Question, on the example at 3:30...if you increase the torque by increasing the meters in this example, your work increases. How would one go about describing where that extra work comes from. You have the same force and same angle, but a greater arc length. Is that where the extra work comes from? Same force applied over more distance?",1

"What is E=MC2 is consistent with TIME AND what is gravity. (TIME is thoroughly consistent with what is gravity ON/IN BALANCE.) WHAT IS E=MC2 is dimensionally consistent. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma.

Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground.

LOOK upwards, ON BALANCE, at what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky !! The orange (AND setting) Sun IS the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE !! NOW, consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE. (BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand.) WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma, AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution.

WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.

Assume the electric field in the scrubber is produced by two parallel, square plates of width ùêø = 1.0 ùëö and separation ùëë = 0.010 ùëö, with charges ¬±ùëÑ.   What must be the value of the electric field between the plates so that the force on the soot particle is equal to the weight of the particle?

It seems to me like if anything, doing that would actually cause the molecules to move even faster, although to an imperceptible amount. And after all, as she said, we're doing work on the system, so unless there's an exit for heat, wouldn't the internal energy increase?

"Laff700 you could say that is the inverse. but how about crystals ? they are fruit of entropy. technically when they form they have less entropy than the space around it, but it is formed naturally when the gas or whatever try to go to a less energy state. so is it order or disorder ? the comparison doesn't make sense",1
"so what is more ordered in a closed system? a cloud of hydrogen/helium plasma or a block of iron with every atom with the exactly same energy ?
with the order/disorder logic, the block of iron is more disordered... see ? it doesn't make any sense. order/disorder is a human concept with values attributed by our own experiences, we can't apply that to a physical system to explain entropy, it just gives a completely wrong idea about how it works and what it is",1
"Frank Schneider I love how you are explaining entropy... but again, it has nothing to do with order or disorder. again, the idea of order and disorder don't make any sense as its a human construct.
I can say that perfect equilibrium, the heat death, is a perfectly ordered system. just like when you sum all the possible combinations of waves in a string, you will get a flat line. so... 
by your point of view, if I pick n numbers from 1 to 10000 in any order, the likelihood for me to pick them in ascending order (what you would call a ordered system) is smaller than picking the number in any other order, but so is any specific combination, every number has the same likelihood or being picked at any given time, it just happen that the combinations we consider ""disordered"" compose a bigger portion of the possibilities, so its more likely that I'll pick them in such a order... but again, I can find any pattern from any sequence of numbers I'm given, and then I can say that the quantity of sequences of numbers I can pick with discernible patterns is bigger than those without any discernible order, it all depend on me, I'm the one that decide if a system is ordered or not.

another example is the classic mix of milk and coffee. there are more possible combinations of molecules of coffee and milk where they are mixed than there are where they are perfectly separated like water and oil. but even though they are not combined in a single entity, but actually floating around each other, I can say that they are actually a perfectly random system, like a noise pattern. one can say that a noise pattern is disordered, but if I separate the mixture in small chunks I can find that each chunk has extremely similar number of coffee and milk particles as if it was deliberately organized so the numbers of particles will match... so, should we consider it ordered or disordered ? you can, of course, say that the system is chaotic, because of chaotic dynamics, and that is where I believe the idea of entropy as ""disorder"" came from. but try to call a Chaotic system ""disordered"" and Lorenz itself will come from the grave to punch you in the face",1

"Hey quick question for those interested. How much do you need to cool a solar cell operating at, let's say, 23% efficiency?

My thoughts are that a solar cell should not change its internal energt U, so in other words deltaU or dU/dt should be 0. So 23% of the solar energy becomes electrical work, while the rest of the sun's power (1-0.23=0.77) becomes heat that accumulates in the solar cell.


In order for dU/dt (delta U) of the solar cell to be 0 you need to fulfill Q=W, so in other words you need to cool the cell to such an extent that the only heat that isn't cooled off equals the electrical power of the solar cell, in this case 0.54 times the power of the sun? 

Is this way of thinking correct? I would very much appreciate any input.",1

"No object is put on motion without the hit of an external force. Since there should be an initially force applied to an object in order for the object to start it state of motion, therefore there is acceleration involved for any object in motion. As long as the acceleration is not zero the object velocity should increase and increase to infinity, assuming the object is not under the influence of any external forces at all.

Example, suppose an object is suspended without any, whatsoever, forces acting on it. Now, you hit the object with something. So the object will start its motion. This means the object will begin with  acceleration. Does this positive acceleration remains with the object. Again assuming the object not being subjected to any external forces. If the object is under the influence of acceleration due to the initial hitting then the velocity of the object will keep increasing and increasing. So an object in motion will not continue its journey with constant velocity. That is an object in heaven in motion must be under a positive acceleration and with a non zero acceleration the velocity keep increasing. Would you please clear me about this subject? Thank you",1

That‚Äôs why he used 1 here instead of 9x10^9 as k

Why have you removed the next 2 videos?,1
"I don't mean to over simplify things but particles (even those as large as Buckey Balls [the double slit experiment]) in a free flowing system ( ie. light shining on a plate) are in one state and when they are acted upon by any other energy field or matter they can have an observable change state.  
In fact the energy required to make an observation is enough to cause the state change.  
In the ""Free Flow"" state they exhibit the properties of a wave, when that state is interrupted by any external field the state changes.
In a static system a simple ruler or a bounced beam is enough to make measurements.    In a dynamic system the measurement requires a change in the kinetic energy of the system.   Even the radar used to measure a car's velocity has a slight (although minuscule) effect.    
In a free flowing liquid the introduction of a point restriction ( dip a stick into a smooth flowing creek) causes eddy currents that alternate from side to side.  This can be used to measure the flow rate, but only to a point.   If the flow rate is to slow it will not produce eddy currents.  The change of the rate of flow that produces eddy currents is a state change of the system.   Of course we can explain in detail why and how this state change occurs but the fact remains that the introduction of any point restriction into a free flowing fluid will cause eddy currents if the energy level is sufficient. 
What is the maximum size of particles that will conform to the double slit experiment in a zero G environment??
What happens in both of these experiments when they are in a super cooled environment?  
In my mind the triple point of water is a similar phenomena where water molecules exists in three states at once and any oscillation of the energy field can cause a change of state.",1

Why is this on trending? Might as well watch since I'm not doing very well in my physics class lol.,1
Where the f did nuclear physics and part 2 of QM go? I was planning on watching those this night.,1
All that we learned is okay. However a question comes in mind is that if a light ray / photon with energy equals work function hits an electron and sets it free from the bound of metal surface and another photon hit this free electron; will the photon not affect electron's kinetic energy or photon will only scatter and not absorbed? The statement that increasing the number of photons do not affect kinetic energy of electrons seems to be strict and leads to the conclusion that photon will only scatter in this case. Any one to confirm / explain it a little further?,1
What if the energy of the photon is equal to the work function ?,1

"Einstein created photoelectric effect experiment to prove quanta?
I'm under the impression that Hertz observed the effect, and did not investigate it. Einstein later applied Planck's concept to Hertz's observations to explain the effect.",1
"I've been reading about atoms and I'm a bit confused. According to the internet ""electromagnetic force"" holds the protons of the nucleus and electrons together while kinetic force of the electrons pulls them apart. But isnt this just general relativity?

As in; at first sight electrons and protons dont appear to be perfect opposites because an electron behaves differently (whizzing around outside the nucleus) and is also 1832 times less massive. But its energy is also comparably more massive than the proton per unit mass (MEv)

This is in line with the Energy - mass equivalence (E=mc2) suggesting that an electron is the antithesis of a proton but one has converted the majority of its mass to energy (electron), the other remains mainly mass and less energy.

So what is electromagnetic force? And assuming the the electron uncertainty cloud could be ""cooled"" to a state of equal mass/ energy as the proton (reducing its ability to stay away from the proton - kinetic energy) would they come together and annihilate eachother? Or leave just neutrons (0).
Wouldnt this mean that at absolute zero kelvin (heat death) atoms would vanish or at least leave neutrons?",1

Hey dude, I got a dumb question for ya over here.

Now I can't seem to find the answer, though that's probably due to my lackluster Google-fu skillz. Anywho, as I understand it the easiest to combat the magnetic fields generated by wires with roughly equal currents traveling in opposite directions is to have them wound together. The currents create opposing magnetic fields at nearly the same location, which results in  essentially no magnetic field being generated. What I'm unsure of is where the energy those magnetic fields goes. Are the wires respective magnetic fields still created its just that due to their proximity the field lines are highly concentrated between the two? Does that just lead to an elecromotive force in conductors in opposition to their currents and increase their resistance? Moreover does that lead to  additional heating of the wire/ noise in any signal? Do they simply cancel one another out completely so the energy never dissipates from the current? Is it lost in some other way ie. ultralow frequency radio waves? Or am I actually as dumb as I'm feelin and have missed something blatantly obvious?",1
3:53 why does he take the B from the wire on the left? The wire on the right also produces a magnetic field. Why can we not use it in the equation for the force? We have its current and could use that R=2. Why can't we do this?,1
What to do if we have different lengths wire?,1
can I ask how to compute the length of each wires if it is not given??,1
What if your question simply writes 'per unit length' and doesn't describe the length of the wires.,1
hey what white board app do you use,1
"What happens if they're of different length?
Newton's third law says that the force of wire 1 onto wire 2 has to be equal and opposite to the force of wire 2 onto wire 1.
Doesn't that necessitate that ¬µ0*I1*I2*L2/(2œÄR) has to equal ¬µ0*I2*I1*L1/(2œÄR), thus that L1 has to equal L2?",1

Reduction, Boost, no affect? we assume the second wire has no voltage, no current.  To produce current of 1amp, how much current/voltage do we need in the first wire. Let's assume they are like within 1cm.",1
"What makes you say if the force is attractive or repulsive.  It is certainly not the direction of the force of each wire by itself.
If that was the case, put a third wire on the far right with its current moving as the first wire, i.e. north.   Now what you gonna do?
It is arrow will be pointing to the left while your B wire's arrow will be pointing to the right?
CONFUSING AS HELL.

The thing is, in every other areas,  forces are always viewed as push force, not pull. A force is always exerted on things has the mental picture of pushing. 
The magnetic force is the only place that the arrows direction is not a push force but a pull force.
When you see an arrow pointing at something, it is not pushing on it, it means pulling on it.
This has never been verbalized.",1
¬†¬† The theory states that the Force is proportional to the product of the two currents in the wires. This only remains true given that the lengths of the wires are the same right?,1

hi !! if you were to add 90 (no deci pt.) and 21.5, would the answer be 112 or just 100? because i thought we had to match the sig figs of the number w the least amt. of decimals to the answer. the answer should be 100, so that it matches 90‚Äôs 1 sig fig. 

however, in my textbook, it says the answer is 112. so following your technique, maybe they did it as:

9 | 0
2 | 1 . 5
_____
11 | 1 . 5

but that would mean there would be two sig figs (and the answer still isnt 112). is the book wrong or did i not understand correctly ?

In other words  clocks are faster on the moving train...
This cannot be true because the whole point is that clocks slow down as you approach the speed of light on a moving train.

Any chance of doing a video on general relativity?,1
Well done. Is General relativity next?,1
"Dear Crash Course, 
I believe you have made a mistake. In the video, you say that when 667 nanoseconds pass for Bob, only 577 nanoseconds have passed for the still reference frame. However, we know that t>t0, and that t= time for still reference frame and t0= time for moving reference frame and not the other way around as shown in the video. If Bob measured 667 ns and the girl measured 577, it would mean that time passed slower for the girl, which is not the case. 
This would mean, that if 667 nanoseconds pass for bob, the observer who is not moving, will measure the time to be 770 ns. This verifies that t>t0. 
Can you please put some light on the situation?

Best regards, 
Malak",1

"This is essentially the famous pole-vaulter running through a barn problem, so I'll use that analogy as it is more fun.  Alice is carrying a long pole through a barn with doors on each end.  At rest, the pole is too long to fit into the barn with both doors closed.  Alice, understanding special relativity, makes a bet with her friends Bob and Charlie that, if she can run fast enough, she can fit the pole inside the barn with both doors closed.  She arranges to have Bob close the front doors as soon as the end of the pole passes into the barn, and Charlie to open the back doors just before the front of the pole reaches the end of the barn.  
                                         
            A                              _____________
                                           /                           \
           O                            /                             \
____/ |\________         B (front door)      C (back door)
           /\                            _______________   

So, with the front doors initially open and the back doors initially closed, Alice runs with her pole through the barn, and Bob and Charlie both handle their door opening/closing duties.  Is the pole ever completely inside the barn with both doors closed at the same time? 

Let's first consider Bob and Charlie's perspective.  Since they occupy the same inertial reference frame (they are motionless relative to each other), I'll just say from Bob's perspective. So from Bob's perspective, the pole shrinks due to length contraction.  Assuming Alice runs fast enough, Bob will see the pole shrink so much that it becomes shorter than the barn.  So when he closes the front doors, the front of the pole will not yet have reached the back doors, hence Charlie will not yet have opened them.  Therefore, according to Bob, the pole fits inside the barn with both doors closed.

But now let's consider Alice's perspective.  According to Alice, the pole stays the same length it has always been. In fact, it is the barn that shrinks.  Clearly if the pole didn't fit into the barn at rest, it certainly won't fit into it now that the barn is shorter.  Therefore, the front of the pole will reach the back of the barn long before the back of the pole clears the front doors.  So Alice will say that Charlie opened the back doors before Bob closed the front doors, and the pole never fit inside the barn with both doors closed.  

How can this be? Relativity tells us that both points of view are equally valid.  The problem is with simultaneity.  Because of time dilation, two observers in different inertial frames travelling at some non-zero relative velocity will disagree on when some event happens.

"This is eerily similar to the Twin problem. Suppose two twins. One is on Earth and the other is in relative motion at a constant speed of 0.5c, on a spacecraft. The twin eventually returns to Earth.  From the twin in the spacecraft, it could well appear that Earth is moving away from it at a speed of 0.5c. Upon returning which twin experienced time dilation so which twin will be older than the other and which will be younger? The younger twin is the one that experienced time dilation but who is this exactly?
I do not think I can explain this answer in a manner which is easy to explain however a solution was posted by minutephysics in his twin paradox video. The answer revolves around the notion that the perspective of time is rotated for one of the twins relative to the other. The twin who did experience time dilation is the one that goes off on his journey in the spacecraft so in this case, it would still be Bob that experiences the time dilation and so his clock will be behind yours :)

"To Arkalius80:  Thank you for mentioning I can post links to my videos.  I have my own reasons for not doing this.  I admire your thoroughness in replying to both my comments on this video.  Until you did, I did not realize I had commented 2 x here by mistake.  Sorry.  I realize I am displaying what you call arrogance by criticizing the theories of others.  I hope you realize many other physicists admit relativity theory and quantum theory, and other professionally used theories, have problems.  I accept any theory for both its good and its bad, and in physics I have tried to make improvements.  I have spent over 30 years trying to improve on the fundamental assumptions of the professionally used theories, to invent a theory which has more good and less bad.  Resultantly, I happen to have invented what I am certain is a better theory.  If you have viewed my videos, and my replies to others‚Äô comments on them, you will understand why I am not publishing in any journal.  I think you need to rethink your position about being offended when someone criticizes a theory or promotes what they think is a better theory.  Would you be offended by, for example, Einstein, for criticizing the established professional theories of his time, and for promoting his relativity theory, which he invented to try to improve on them?  Criticism and promotion are a necessary part of science.  Who will know a problem exists if no 1 mentions it?  Who will know a solution exists if no 1 mentions it?  And instead of having an expert tell you which theory they think is better, you can decide for yourself.  In my video, ‚ÄúParticle 2 Slit Experiments Explained By Paul Marostica‚Äù, I propose what I think is a much more logical explanation of the results of particle 2 slit experiments than the explanation of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.  What do you think?  I would appreciate of any comment you would care to make after viewing that video.",1

I'd like to know where Schrodinger got his cat for that experiment cause I'm pretty sure mine is dead.Whats relativity got to say about that?,1
You are still arguing about something that I don't question and that I accept since I learned about STR. All I claim is that STR is only valid within reference frames. It's only that I believe in something beyond those reference frames. Do you have an opinion on presentism (and possible infringement with STR) and the last paragraph in my previous comment?,1
"Fair enough. And I may took your first answer to my original question maybe a bit too deprecatory. But still, could you answer my original question (the very first sentence) with one or the other?

the lightning part didn't make sense. Was there one strike or two?,1
"In that train example the light travels the same exact path for both observers it's just that the guy on the train isn't able to see one dimension of the travel. So how is there any kind of path length difference? That's like saying if I walk around the earth I think I just went in a straight line but an outside observer can see that I walked a circle around the sphere. I can't feel the curve but its still there, just like the guy on the train doesn't see the forward motion of the light but the light still moves forward. Am I missing something here?",1
"Yes, I believe that the correct way to explain this is that as a stationary observer on the platform, you would conclude that the lightning from the front of the train would reach Bob first. Which is not what happened from Bob's perspective.",1
"Where does it say in the video that light isn't moving forward? The guy on the trains sees the light moving at the speed of light, the lady on the platforms sees the light moving at the speed of light.",1
"Bob's sight is limited by being inside the train, and not taking the outside world into consideration. Are you saying that just because bob doesn't consider the world outside of the train that it doesn't have an effect on the motion of his light beam or ball?  I feel like this relativity thing is trying to separate things that are inseparable. I understand that to bob the ball looks like it goes in a straight line and in his reference frame it does, but his frame is nested inside of the platform observers frame so the angled path of the ball still exists even though he doesn't see it. To go one further, if you zoom out and consider that the platform is moving with the earth the REAL path is different than what the platform observer sees. Then you can add the movement of the earth around the sun, then the sun around the galaxy and so on... Instead of trying to separate every reference frame I think we need to add them all together to figure out the true path of the light beam. Maybe light doesn't move at all and what we are actually seeing is the speed of the earth in relation to a fixed point that light binds to upon emission?",1
"""Since Bob is at rest in an inertial reference frame, the outside world does not affect him or his ball or light.""

So if the train hits a wall outside of bobs reference frame he wouldn't feel anything?",1
"so when viewed from the platform the light beam has sideways motion and forward motion which gives it an angled path, but when viewed by bob inside the train that forward motion disappears? what happens to the forward momentum of the photons when you switch reference frames?",1
"Matt Nothing happens to the momentum of the photon. Refering back to the train, you as a stationary observer see the train as having a momentum of mv. However for bob, the train is stationary and you are the one with a momentum of mv (of different value).

So who is right? In special relativity, both would be right as the law of physics are obeyed in both reference frames.

The difference with photons is that its speed is constant, therefore time dilation compensates the difference in perceived speed",1
why do you need to account for a difference in perceived speed when the actual speed is not different?,1
"If I'm understanding this correctly, time appears to be moving more slowly on the train from the station, and more slowly at the station from the train. Is that right?",1
ok bare with me here. hypothetically you're on a ship in outer space this ship is traveling at 99.9% the speed of light once 99% the speed of light is reached a small ship to detaches and floats above the 1st ship and engages its boosters that will accelerate it to 99% the speed of light. ok what happens with the second ship once it begins to accelerate to 99% the speed of light? is the 2nd ship traveling faster than the speed of light relative to every object it was measured against before it started to accelerate.,1

"If a spaceship was traveling ¬Ω speed of light while another spaceship was ¬æ the speed of light traveling towards each other what would the people see as they passed each other?

"thats great but im talking from a outside Observer watching the ship traveling at 99% the speed of light, then watching a second ship detach traveling at the same speed accelerating at the same speed then firing its thrusters. relative to the first ship it will only be moving very slowly compared relativity. however compared to any Observer the 2nd ship should be moving faster than the speed of light. 2 attached ships. moving 99%c. they detach from each other. the 2nd ship now fires unused thrusters capable of accelerating itself to 99%C. how would an outside Observer view the 2nd ship already moving at 99%C now firing the unused Rockets. does the 2nd ship ever physically travel faster than the speed of light",1
"a) I think you make the mistake, of thinking, that there is a kind of objective perspective. But lets  reframe the question in a way that makes sense ( as I understand it): There are are three ships. ship 1 measures the speed of ship 2 with 0.99 c ship 2 measures the speed of ship 3 with 0.99 c  (in the same direction). what is the speed of ship 2 from the perspective of ship 1.
b) try to use the formula u learned in this episode. at 0.99 c y=7.09 (round about)
mhh ok I suppose, there is something wrong I expected it to be a little bigger than 10. Doesn't work out that way.
so hopefully someone finds the mistake and you finish the calculation with y=10.",1
"no, I meant the object that the light come out of. How does the light know to go at the same speed no matter which way and how fast the object is going?",1
"D√° di , perception and actuality are two very different things. if a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound?... absolutely it did. 

now one thing that might make sense is that when you are traveling at light speed... the theoretical speed limit of the universe, then time would hold still as every molecule and atom in your body would be moving at its maximum speed and not be able to move in any other direction without slowing that directional velocity. like a feather stuck on a grill of a car. nothing can move it react. you couldn't even perceive the event because your synapse would be frozen at that speed and direction. ... perhaps then, time and aging would change. for the rider the to was instantaneous, but for the stationary person, time has elapsed... of course the stationary person is correct and the rider was essentially put into stasis",1
"The speed of light is a subject that people talk a lot... I know! But Einstein said:"" that nothing can go faster then the speed of light. But who am i to say something like this... God can make the rules he want!"" He's right! What about the double speed of light? What if i put two flashlight againts each other and facing the oposite direction. When i turn the light on (on both flashlight) what would be the speed of the distance of each light. You might say to me... Francis! A speed is a reference of something moving away from a specific point. Well yes! One photon is moving away from the other photon. So! Wouldn't the speed be 2Xspeed of light? What do you think?",1

"imagine what you want however if ""light travels in a straight line"" then a flash would either miss the mirror or with a long mirror miss the flasher. 
2 in fact the opposite of what is described, if we imagine the light traveling the greater distance [2.5 meters more] then to travel more distance at the same speed called C, requires MORE time if this would occur then more time passed on the moving train, where the light moved in reality, not less dilated time.

2. probably the most helpful is get a full 8 hours of sleep and stay on that schedule don't deviate from it.
3. you don't focus better if you have your favourite play list playing. try classical music play lists.
4. detailed schedule of what topics you're going to learn.
5. leave your phone outside the room you are studying in. 
6. don't study in a room that will get you distracted.
7. follow an eating schedule closely you can't concentrate on an empty stomach trust me",1

"ON THE NECESSARY, TRUE, AND ABSOLUTE PHYSICAL ESSENTIALITY (IN AND WITH TIME) OF THE FACT THAT E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=MA:

INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. NOW, consider WHAT IS THE EYE. E=MC2 IS F=MA. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Consider what is outer ""space"". NOW, consider WHAT necessarily constitutes what is the Sun. E=MC2 IS F=ma. NOW, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Think INSTANTANEITY !

The INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE. It is a very great truth that the ability of thought to DESCRIBE OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT is similar to sensory experience. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY. In dreams, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE !!! The EARTH AND THE SUN are E=MC2 AND F=ma IN BALANCE. There is no outsmarting the genius of dreams. Importantly, dream experience GROWS/increases. In dreams, it is you AND other than you are IN BALANCE. GREAT.

The Earth (A PLANET) is a MIDDLE DISTANCE form that is in BALANCED relation to the Sun AND the speed of light (c), AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma.

This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.

WHY ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS UNIFIED AND BALANCED WITH/AS WHAT IS GRAVITY:


Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY are LINKED AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Therefore, Einstein's equations and Maxwell's equations are unified (given the addition of a fourth spatial dimension); AS E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma; AS TIME DILATION proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ACCORDINGLY, Einstein's equations predict that SPACE is expanding OR contracting in and with TIME; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.)


Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, the rotation of the Moon MATCHES it's revolution. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!!


The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Let's compare this directly with BOTH a falling object AND the speed of light (c). Great. E=mc2 IS F=ma.

is there a direction to the force for the last question??,1
How do I calculate it in my scientific calculator?,1
Why did you us the Fe and the Fs calcualtions from #5 to solve problem #6?,1
"I would like to challenge the scientific community especially physics on the perception of a force unseen called gravity...

I would like to suggest another way to Invision gravity not as a force carrier of attraction but as a suspension phenomenon

Suspension of mass as a phenomena of a trajectory spin spiral of mass changing the observed trajectory from the master trajectory spin spiral mass, by increasing its illusion of a gravity attraction force from a change in the observed trajectory spin spiral mass with in an originating phenomenon as a trajectory spin spiral of mass...

A momentum field disruption by a change in trajectory spin spiral of mass direction causing the quantified mass of trajectory spin spiral mass to change its spatial resonance spiraling of mass as in lose inertia momentum or gain inertia momentum or resonant with in the master mass trajectory spin spiral creating an illusion of a force field called gravity when it really is a loss or gain of velocity locally with in the master spiraling mass....

 as a result of trajectory spin spiral of mass with in an resonant envelope of a trajectory spin spiral of mass...

This resistance of change of direction of a trajectory spin spiral mass...

Change of real time coordinates interaction from the resonant trajectory spin spiral of the master envelope of mass as a trajectory spin spiral as from a deviation of the secondary trajectory spin spiral mass against the resonant trajectory spin spiral of mass as a momentum field, creating a suspension phenomenon not an attraction force field called a gravity.... rather an suspension phenomenon that increase or decrease the total trajectory spin spiral mass of the Master resonance derivatives observed locally with in the envelope of a mass spiraling as a trajectory spin spiral of mass within the mass with it's own quantified trajectory spin spiral of mass

So we are basically attached to the master resonance of a trajectory spin spiral as a planet, solar system, galaxy, galactic clusters, observable universe....as a quantified trajectory spin spiraling mass with quantified subsets within the spiraling mass with a trajectory....why the spin?


Whatcha think?

Anyone?

Good day everyone!

Gravity is a Suspension Phenomena not an attraction force field that has never been seen the so called graviton cuz it doesn't exist because the illusion called gravity is really a suspension phenomena....

Once we accept it as a suspension phenomena we should be able to find alternate ways of transporting ourselves through the cosmos without energetic systems other than being able to de-energize or energize are local trajectory spins spiral within the master spiral... That may take more understanding at the subatomic phenomena then the use of energetic systems as in fuel rockets

"Grow too much food so when the food truck is empty, it takes back the extra food with blemishes for fertilzer on indoor crops where there's no need for pestcde as there no bugs indoors, you can grow any crop with with above  or below ground (mirrored clay wall) vertical farms, magnifying glass panels at ground level, solar 24/7/365 growing seasons, indoor fresh water fish farms, indoor whaling, grow grass and put cows and chickens on it all year round (won't even stink up a metropolitan city in a high rise) plant dirt and grass and cows where torn down factories left concrete waste slabs) in a building grass can be grown in many floor to ceiling returnable plats on a conveyer, that's takes it up to the dairy floors for food where the cows eat it at 3' above the floor, the floor has a squeegee system and the cows are herded from one half of the floor to the other for cleaning: an automated squeege cleans the floor and empties it into a special for drain: the cow manure goes back down in a pipe for fertilizer : ) the floor has a floor washer, like a car wash, but with clean spayed water on the floor and a squeegee system : ) So good

 Salt water can be separated with oxygen being released like a rain forest to the outside air while the electricity generated disinfects waste water as it makes energy (NASA does this to make cabin oxygen while it releases everything else to space) Everyone uses a small steam distiller to disinfect and remove salt at the sink for drinking and cooking, everyone gets soft water to their house from the ocean, (already has natural salt in it) drag pipelines to every continent, more jobs, and divert river system maybe to deserts to take sea water rise from melting ice caps and maybe restock what used to be an ocean, natural sand filter at least, just don't put sharks in there and you can surf : )

 NASA uses electrolysis to make cabin oxygen from water and they release the hydrogen gas to outer space, you could use the h as clean energy and release the oxygen to the planet as a rain forest, drag ocean soft water to municipalities, they use a small steam distiller at the sink for drinking water, everyone's off toilet to tap, and you use electrolysis to disinfect the waste water and make energy. You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there's solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation. You can grow every crop in the world, everywhere, indoor, with every climate and 24/7/365 agriculture, and not even smell farm animals in a building 

For what it costs to build housing here and grow food on welfare, we can pay people who want to go to another country and build indoor farms and drag ocean lines and build clean energy waste water stations. Who wants to get paid to go to south America and maybe even live there? Whether you were from there, want to get paid to go on a humanitarian effort, or maybe move there : )

With today's technology and the skilled people who came here to learn skills, maybe they would love to develop their home turns and make it great, with more than enough food and water and electricity for everyone, everywhere

People work for each other for paper and out of an overflow they trade. Everywhere will be a good home for everyone who lives there

Food in cold climates can be grown underground in clay dug out cylinders with mirrored walls, solar night lights and heaters and glass solar roofs",1

Hi from where are you,1
"it took me several replays to finally get this. ON the slim chance you do anything else on this, I would put the equation for Magnetic field as well as the flux that way we can see WHY the flux is either decreasing or increasing. Also, is there a rule for the directions for Bex and Bin to keep flux equal? as in, if flux decreasing and Bex is into page, then Bin is into page as well",1
Doesn't the change in the magnetic flux cause a induced electric field? And wouldn't the induced electric field cause the work to be done on the electrons that create a voltage and current?,1
"I'm confused about the example with the straight wire. He says at 8:48 that if the flux is decreasing then the system will try to oppose that and increase the flux to bring it back, but the induced current is found to be out of the page to ""support a decrease in flux"". Could someone explain that? Why would we support a decrease in this scenario if the system want's to increase it so it's back to equillibrium?",1
For the last problem where I is decreasing shouldn't the induced current move CW to oppose? Original B is decreasing out of the page. which produces an increasing field into the page  in the loop and I moving CCW.  According to Lenz law there must be.an I opposing the new field so current has to move CW and B must be the same direction as original B out of the page.,1
3:40 What is the reason behind making the inside of the coil into the page? How does that oppose the existing uniform magnetic field?,1
what happens if the magnetic field is constant though or if the current is constant?,1
"why does the flux decrease when you decrease the current? Won't B increase, and consequently the flux?",1
¬†¬† How'd it go?,1
OMG. How the hack you can make me understand of this!,1
"But what about the magnetic field, outside the coil. If we take the first example, the magnetic field created by the induced emf, would go against the increase in flux inside the coil, but wouldn‚Äôt it go with the magnetic field outside the wire. Wouldn‚Äôt it increase the field outside the wire, and induce even more current. I think the magnetic field/flux, only affects the inside of the coil, but why is that? Is there a law for that?",1
what happened to the direction of current when the wire is fully in the magnetic field?,1
"i dont believe the magnetic field around a wire conductor is oriented circumferentially. where is the north and south in such case? rather, the lines of magnetic force travel from the point of polarization to the furthest point of the conductor.",1
8:40 why the flux is decreasing as the current decreasing?,1
"Um, at 3 minutes into your video you state the ""right-hand rule""...? In fact it's the left hand rule that demonstrates the direction of current flow/flux lines, so you have it backwards? I quit watching after that. Please clarify?",1

"Lift: Because the air moves faster over the top of the wing, it is less dense (more spread out). Less dense air means lower air pressure. 
The air pressure difference between the top and bottom of the wing is what causes the lift.
This is the principle behind Bernoulli's Equation, which says the energy in  the air between its pressure (the outward expanding force of a parcel of air and a form of energy density) and its kinetic energy (as given by the v squared terms) are conserved. 
What causes a decrease in lift by ice buildup on wings?
The drag on the air causes it to slow down, negating the pressure difference.
Moreover, it causes turbulence at the trailing edge of the wing due to less airflow over the top of the wing.",1

Thanks! How do I work out velocity of air over and under the wings?,1

What effect would jet engines exiting force have on a wingspans lift if situated in front of them, far enough for them not to melt? Would it increase lift or is there some paradox I'm missing.",1

How about the Symmetric airfoil ? at 0 angle of attack the V of wind are  the same on the lower and upper airfoil ? Please tell the lift force with >0 angle of attack !,1

"I don't know if I have too many missing variables but I cant solve this problem.

Density of air surrounding the object is 1.3

Do we not use Coefficient of Lift when dealing with an airfoil shape?
What is total velocity if Lift equals weight?",1
"There is an equation called ""Lift Force Equation"" and in that equation, there is no velocity differential. Instead, there is only one velocity, which is aircraft velocity. Why are they ignoring V2-V1 and write only V ? Additionally, we know that lift force increases as aircraft speed increases. How can I understand it through this equation you wrote? V2 will increase to the same extend V1 does. Doesn't it?",1
so the wind goes under the house????,1
"Damn smart question. I have another question. If what is wanted is for the top of the airfoil to have more pressure so that the air moves faster and generates lift, why don't some planes or jets have their propellers on top of the wings instead of beneath it? Wouldn't that reduce the need for so much power from propellers for take of or just flight in general?",1

Last time I checked the test result was; light emitted as individual photons did comply  with these test settings and cumulative total of particles created expected patterns with min and max areas.

On the first problem how much toque would it produce?,1
"On example 2, we have eqaul 4 masses. But their distance from center of mass or axis are not equal to 5cm. They formed square yeah ? So their distance should be half the diagonal of square. Correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you üôè",1

Where're the phasor diagrams?,1
Karan Dosanjh and what do you mean by at sine 90 when you're talking about DC current ?,1
"Rofaida Elsayed You know when we derive these relations step by step , sine of 90 comes in place. 

Have you seen this formula?...

I= I(max) x Sin(theta)
E= E(max) x Sin(90+theta) in the case of inductor

And

I= I(max) x Sin(theta)
E= E(max) x Sin(90 minus theta) in the case of Capacitor. 
Note that when ever the voltage or current is alternating, the ‚Äòtheta‚Äô always changes

Have you done the ‚ÄòImpedence Triangle‚Äô
That is all related with the phase difference. I will see if i can suggest you some links of videos...",1
"Rofaida Elsayed well its all the same in any voltage. 
Just think of it like this , when Current in DC begins to rise, it acts as the 1/4th part of the AC current. Imagine 1 full cycle of AC graph till 2pie. Then imagine it till pie/2. And that is where the DC becomes constant. And after that, current flows through inductor. 
It also makes sense as the phase shift is seen in sine of theta. 
Theta keeps changing in ac. But in dc , the theta increases from zero to 90 and stays there. It makes sense as sine of 90 is also 1. Which could be the maximum value of current a dc circuit could ever have",1
Rofaida Elsayed is there any way i could show it to you by my own pen and paper?,1
Anyone smell toast but no one is making any?,1
It's nice. She can read!!! Who wants to bet that her current understating is close to nothing?,1

For those trying to learn this subject I recommend looking at some of the many well crafted home made videos on this subject that can be found on youtube.",1
Is she rappin?!,1
"And what kind of work is electrical design, Dylan? I do both digital and analog circuit design and make regular use of this knowledge.

what's with the cone-shaped magnetic field surface ,1
"..so as light slows down through certain media, does te magnetic field alter accordingly?",1
So just a question from someone that is slow at understanding this stuff. In the Video we said let the x axis be the direction of the wave and the y and Z axis be the E field and the B field. This wave then propagate through a vacuum  at the speed of light (3E8 m/s). So does this mean the RATE in which the E field induces the B field and vice sa versa has to happen at a rate faster than the speed of light or does it mean that the rate in which the two fields inducing each other IS at a rate of 3E8?,1

The homeowner desires that a ceiling fan with light kits be installed in 5 different rooms.
Each fan contains a light kit that can accomodate four 60-watt lamps. Each fan motor draws a current of 1.8 amperes when operated on high speed. 
It is assumed that each fan can operate more than three hours at a time and therefore must be considered a continuos-duty device. The fans are to be connected to a 15-ampere circuit.
Because the devices are continuos duty, the circuit current must be limited to 80% of the continuos connected load.
How many fans can be connected to a single 15-ampere circuit?

"A question for you I couldn't possibly answer myself with all the Google access. I could muster...

I want to use a TEC or multiple TECs for cooling a water system, I'm happy to power these and deal with cooling etc I'mnot that fussed about theor efficiency, however, these TEGs are always prefaced with being massively inefficient, so... if I run the TECs to do their cooling job, would it make sense for me to use TEGs as heat sinks, loop the power generated back into the system and recover 5% whilst efficiently cooling the TECs using the seekbeck effect? IE it will absorb the heat ""inefficiently"" doing exactly what I need it to whilst also recycling some of the heat generated, I'm guessing it would make more sense to have a heat sink to build up a stable heat in something then have the TEGs feeding off the heat of that? Rather than trying to stick them directly to each other like hot output of TEC to hot input of TEG? I'm not looking to make a perpetual motion machine or anything, but it seems like I'm killing about 4 birds with one stone by doing this?

"How does a voltage develop across the unconnected end of a single wire connected to one terminal of a battery and the other terminal? 

If the battery‚Äôs net charge is zero, then for a 12 V battery, one terminal would be at a potential of +6 V with respect to a conductor at infinity, while the other terminal would be at ‚Äì6 V. At the physical center in the space between the two terminals of the battery, the voltage is zero.
If we then connect a small wire to, say, the positive terminal, a few excess point charges will move onto the wire, and that wire will now be at the same potential as the battery terminal: +6 V. The wire will be surrounded by an e-field, and since the lines of electrostatic flux must always terminate upon charges, the wires must possess an excess surface charge. 

In the above we assumed the net charge of the battery was zero. Supposing that the battery had a net charge. Then how would the charges, potentials and voltage be changed? 

Before we answer this, it would be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level.
Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two as in the following two videos:
i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and 
ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo 

Returning to our question of the voltage of the single wire connected to one battery terminal,¬† we assume the net charge of the battery was not initially zero. Perhaps someone with rubber-sole shoes carried the battery while walking on a wool carpet or perhaps the battery was charged to ‚Äì5000 V, and would deliver a tiny spark if touched. In that case one terminal would still be 12 V different than the other terminal, perhaps ‚Äì5000 V on the positive terminal and ‚Äì5012 V on the negative. 

It is not possible in this brief post to discuss in more detail the process of production of the voltage of the single wire without a detailed discussion of the capacitance and potential of single conductors.
The last frame References in video #1¬† lists textbook 4 which discusses these topics comprehensively using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of voltage of a single short and long wire with and without a net charge on the battery.",1

"Something dosen't make sense here for me...for number 4, the ke is increasing- makes sense. What doesn't make sense is how electric potential increased too... the formula is v=pe/q. This means that both PE and Ke increased, but that can be it. Can someone please explain ???",1

"4:43 this is backwards, isn't it? V_ab is the voltage at A with respect to B. You would write the integral with ""a"" as the lower limit and ""b"" as the upper limit. V_ab is Vb - Va.

"I have a question. I learned that the cathode has a higher electric potential than the anode (the positive has a higher electric potential than the negative) but the negative is the one that has the higher electrons thus more charge thus logically higher potential energy right?

P.s. i watched this and other videos to get an understanding of what voltage is and how it works, and i still dont know. I saw electrons and protons emit an electric field and when two objects with equal opposite net charges are next to each other it creates a potential difference aka a voltage, but then you go and say a negatively charged plate has a voltage of zero. What makes it make even less sense is you are saying one plate with a net charge does have a voltage and the other plate that also has a net charge has no voltage. If an object with a net charge has a voltage, why does one plate have zero volts? Am i learning this wrong or is it being taught wrong?",1

"WHAT OBJECT OCCUPIES THE MOST SPACE?:

The answer, incredibly AND ON BALANCE, is WHAT IS E=MC2 !!!! Here's the full proof and the explanation.

The SPACE that surrounds us IS quantum gravitational (ON/IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great.

Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS ‚Äúmass‚Äù/energy is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Great.

To answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat is nothing in accordance with physics (AND TIME)?‚Äù, we must understand (ON BALANCE) WHAT IS SOMETHING; AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. The ultimate unification and understanding of physics/physical experience (AND TIME) combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites. Carefully consider what is THE EYE (ON BALANCE). Do notice the associated black ‚Äúspace‚Äù AND the dome AS WELL. NOW, carefully consider what follows !!!! The following proves what is the fourth dimension ON BALANCE.

WHAT IS E=MC2 is the fundamental basis for the true understanding of what is inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE !!!! (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE.) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2, c squared CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. INDEED, consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE; AS two AND three dimensional SPACE are, in fact, BALANCED !!!! Great. What is gravity is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked. Consider what is the ORANGE AND setting SUN. Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) MOON. It is the same size as what is THE EYE. Notice what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Indeed, consider complete combustion !!!! (I have mathematically proven the fourth dimension.) The density of what is pure WATER IS HALF of that of what is packed sand/wet packed sand. Now, WHAT IS THE EARTH IS ALSO BLUE !!!! The rotation of WHAT IS ‚ÄúTHE MOON‚Äù matches the revolution, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked (AND BALANCED) opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, I have solved WHAT IS the coronal heating ‚Äúproblem‚Äù. GREAT. (Indeed, consider what is lightning.)

Absolute SPACE IS the truly and fundamentally BALANCED inertial frame (or SPACE). Indeed, ‚Äúmass‚Äù/ENERGY is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE (ON BALANCE) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS this proves what is the FOURTH dimension. Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Great !!!! Think. The fourth dimension AND WHAT IS E=MC2 are FUNDAMENTALLY consistent with/AS what are wave/particle duality AND the fact that c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE (REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE !!!! INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS ‚Äúmass‚Äù/ENERGY is (CLEARLY) electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), I have mathematically proven and explained what is the FOURTH dimension; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AND consider what is complete combustion (ON BALANCE); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Great. It is proven. Finally, ON BALANCE, notice WHAT IS the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Magnificent !!!! Think. It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!! Notice WHAT IS ‚ÄúTHE MOON‚Äù (ON BALANCE) !!!! THINK !!!! ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT !!!! CONSIDER TIME AND TIME DILATION ON BALANCE !!!! GREAT !!!! AGAIN, do notice WHAT IS the ORANGE ‚ÄúSUN‚Äù ON BALANCE !!!! Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE.

"GelidGanef
For me its seems that this video aims to be part of a series ""crash course physics"", not in deep math guide with added physics.

Also if one plans to make a series of short & informative videos about physics, doing math ¬†is not the way to do it.

Physics can be understood without going deep in math.
As it can be viewed both from a rational, and empirical viewpoint - physics is dealing with reality, yes math is an useful tool for describing it but its not the only one, even tough it is the most useful. Stating that one can understand physics only from a mathematical viewpoint is very shortsighted.

Tell me please why acceleration is beyond comprehension without knowledge of calculus?

I'm a Uni student in physics as well, or rather chemistry perhaps - a mix of both really, so I think I have OK background. Still I feel the need for additional 0.3 seconds between sentences so that I have the time to verify what she says is correct.

Both series on history are great. ""wait for it... the mongols!"" recurring  joke! :) I liked the astronomy-series too. Great presenter! Most presenters are good, including this one, but the edit people let her down. I actually hoped the astronomy would be more advanced than it turned out to be. Thus I had great hopes for Physics.",1

"+WaterMelonFan1 I'm an academic advisor at an American post-secondary school, who has a bit of familiarity with the British system (though I am more familiar with post-secondary education there). AP Physics 1 and 2 are courses taught in secondary schools over an entire school year (Fall to Spring) that culminate in a test and is intended to cover the same material found in Algebra and Trigonometry based physics courses (often called ""College Physics"") that comprise a single semester of post-secondary education. This is likely to be the rough equivalent of the British ""A-levels"" Physics. This is distinct from more advanced, Calculus based Physics, which are often labeled by topics they cover, such as ""Mechanics and Heat"" and ""Optics and Light"" etc. and are called ""University Physics"" (sometimes ""Engineering Physics"") Those going into a medical field typically only need the Algebra/Trigonometry based physics (this course), those going into other STEM fields, especially any type of engineering, physics, or mathematics, typically need the Calculus based physics courses as part of the course of study for their first degree. Those going into non-STEM fields tend to avoid these physics and instead opt to take basic physics and/or astronomy if they want a physics based course to meet their science requirement (US schools typically require a minimum of two semesters in a life or physical science). Does that help a little?",1

"I have a very important 2 questions for me:)

1. In space, there is a space shuttle that does't move.  Mass of this shuttle is always constant. This space shuttle has a rocket engine which produce a constant force of 100N. When the engine is started and the ship has a constant thrust of 100N, when the ship starts to accelerate, will the acceleration be constant and remain constant (let's assume 10m / s), or maybe the acceleration will start to decrease as the speed increases? It is related to the rule Ek = 1 / 2mv ^ 2 ???

2. Same space shuttle doesnt move. Shuttle start to accelerate from 0km/h to 10km/h in 5 seconds and it takes ""X"" energy for example. How much energy it will needed to accelerate also 10km/h more in also in 5 seconds when it allready have velocity of 100km/h ? Also ""X"" energy? Or much more ""X"" of energy? And why is that?",1
What should you do if the given time is at minutes? like 30 mins? Should I make it divided by 1800s?,1
"In question #4 you took acceleration as m/s; however, question says m/s^2. Does this change your answer?",1
"What if time was not given instead the given was only the initial velocity, final velocity and distance? What should I do?",1
"im confused as to your table you created. I understand how you did it. but why wouldnt ""1"" in the table for time be equal to the initial time  which the velocity would be 15. how is there any change in position at 0 seconds.  I understand how you solved the problem for acceleration but im confused with why the 0 was the initial time for the 15 m/s velocity",1
"at 10:11 how come seconds does not end up on top. stay change flip, don't I multiply the seconds w km?",1
Why acceleration is taken as vector? If we take it as change in speed then acceleration would be scalar? Please explain?,1

"3:18 what is that ""lim"" thing mean?",1

So if the acceleration wouldn't be constant, like it goes 42 m/s¬≤ to 43m/s¬≤ and the 41m/s¬≤ and then 42m/s2, the equasion (which is bery simple) would be v1+v2. The changed velocity would be the stable velocities. Right?",1
"If the units in Vi and Vf are not the same what it is gonna happened? 
For example 80km/h is the Vi and Vf is 35.8m/s and the time is 5sec",1

Why did we divide V by 15 when we wanted to calculate voltage drop for 15 meters, but then multiply it by 300 when we wanted to calculate voltage drop for 300m? Shouldn't we take the original resistance at 20 C (1.783 mv) and divide it by 300m instead?",1
"Hi, just a question to do with the difference between single-core cable and twin cable. If you have a Cross-Sectional-Radius (CSA) on a cable of 2.5mm and it is a twin cable, do you double the Cross-Sectional-Raduis (CSA) to 5mm as you are sending a set voltage( Let‚Äôs say 230v for me in the UK) down 2 cables, in which case you half the voltage as it‚Äôs going down 2 separate cables?

Because this would then change the value of resistance at the end of the circuit.

BTW I real like your teaching method here. This was very interesting",1
"I probably won't get a response, but I just have a question. In the exercise (1.) Does upper plate have a mass? (I was thinking that, as you needed a force to push it) Let's say also we have two plates (P1,P2) which both varies in mass, the plate (P1) with the bigger mass needs more force to make it accelerate (F = ma) to a certain velocity, and the plate with a smaller mass (P2), which means that it needs less force to make it accelerate to the same velocity. As the viscosity coefficient was determined by the equation (Œ∑=Fl/vA), then doesn't that mean that the plate with the larger mass would increase the viscosity of the fluid?

Could you make a Vedic about unit if centrical force,1
"This is what I think about? Is it correct.

Centrifugal force in circular motion  is comparable to the the reaction force in linear motion on the driver when he applies the brakes?

The forces applied on the car to stop is the braking forces exerted in the backward direction.

The force that throws u in the forward direction after braking is your body‚Äôs reaction.

Braking force is comparable to the inward pull it tension i the spinning string and if the string loses its strength the cutoff portion would feel the centrifugal force and would be thrown away radially out.

If a stone is attached to a spinning string or rope the stone would go tangentially out due to the tangential or instantaneous velocity.

Radially Inward acceleration always exists because the velocity is continuously changing.
The radially inward leads to radially inward force which is newtons second law of motion. 

Centrifugal force is the mass of the rock times the inward acceleration. It is a fictitious force.  The real force is centripetal force.

Where as the centripetal force proportional to square of the velocity and inversely proportional to the radius.",1

However, if you want for him to continue to create new content it only makes sense to have a recurring charge.

You would not pay a tutor just once and expect them to tutor you as much as you want for the rest of your life would you?

Do you see what I'm trying to say?",1
Do you have access to EVREYTHING or would you need a patreon subscription?,1
Basically YouTube has monetization so when every video is played he gets revenue for every ads we play at the beginning so when video is played he gets paid. Say if he gets 0.10cents per 1000 ad plays and his minimum views stands between 650k-1M so basically he earns average of 650 dollars per video if his video has 650k views or if he has 1000k views he probably gets 1000dollars per video. Which is quite a good revenue.. i said the average amount per 1000 views is 0.10 usd which can vary according to location may be he can get upto 6usd per 1000 views so that will give eg 650k views = 39k USD which is good revenue isn't it? Still he wants to have more from subscribers for few complaicated problems? Thts insane mathematics,1

What about in a gas when p1=p2 but there‚Äôs a temperature difference?,1
"1. When fluid is introduced at pressure p1 in pipe , flow through pipe causes pressure drop which is given by poiseullie‚Äôs equation 

P1- P2/R = Q 

Where R is resistance to flow factor = 8*x*L / (3.14 * r^4)

X = coff of viscosity 
r = radius of pipe
L= length of pipe

So P2 = P1 ‚Äì QR

So more flow i will take more pressure will drop and I will get output flow at low pressure.

Doubt 1 :-

Physically it will look to me like following 

A) low flow (Q) high pressure (P2) condition - at outlet side velocity of  water leaving would be higher
 
B) High flow low pressure (P2) condition - at outlet side velocity of water leaving would be less

Doubt 2 

Or similarly someone tell me 2 cases 

Case 1 :- P1 = 4 kg/cm2  and P2 = 2kg/cm2
Case 2 :- P1 = 4Kg/cm2  and P2 = 1kg/cm2

In which case flow through pipe is higher ?

How will the heat be conducted to the surface and be converted to keinetic energy .... When the heat is conducting by any chance ....

When energy is converted from weight in form of Keinetic energy to heat energy so much is lost in friction and other sources .... Why not just use all the weight in first place to try and turn a turbine .... See you just now know that will not work ... That's how your idea will also not work :P hehehe,1
"+Ddub1083   We appear to have at least three separate disagreements.  1. The relationship between work and energy, a matter of physics. 2. The convention of labeling different kinds of work depending on the energy source or working medium, a matter of English usage, not physics.  3. The nature of :Darko's engine.  Let's deal with the third one right here.  He did not define it very well.  Reading carefully, he mentioned using gravitational energy to compress an unspecified fluid, creating heat, that heat to be transferred to water, boiling it to power a steam expansion engine which he calls a turbine, presumably to turn a generator to produce electrical energy.

Can we at least agree that his device is silly and there is no need to discuss its details?",1
"+Ddub1083   I started off trying to give :Darko a reasonable answer to his question: was his device workable?  The question of the relationship of energy and work is not central to his question.

Regarding energy and work, consider this.  Is there such a thing as energy independent of work, or at least independent of the possibility of work?  In order to have work, something has to pass from higher energy to lower, and the work done on it is precisely equal to the energy difference. If you put it back, the energy is precisely returned.  If there were no energy gradient, there would be no work.  No work, no way to detect energy.  So without work, is there such a thing as energy?  Is work a manifestation of energy or is energy an invention to explain work?  And can you tell the difference between them?",1

rearranging: delta_v = v * delta_s / R

A lump of gold is suspected to contain some aluminium. If d gold sample has a mass of 500g and is found to av a relative density of 5.2, find what mass of gold is present if d relative densities of gold n aluminum are respectively 19.3 and  2.6",1
"How many grams of water must be

can you show me how to solve this problem , please?",1
"As a 10th-grade high school dropout, I am now age 38 I don't know much about this stuff at all.  I have recently developed a new affection for maths and sciences. Thanks are due to you YouTubers or covid and distance learning. This is the first video I'm watching of yours.
  Anyway, I am in question about the balloon problem. How I picture it.   If it were a ball it would have a more rigid structure.  It could, absent of any foreign influence, remain a ball. Thus allowing the air inside to be neutral to the air outside. Isn't this the viable situation needed, to be able to apply your formula?     The balloon, on the other hand, is completely limp and non-rigid when neutral until more and more air gets forced into it and is pressurized enough to form the ball shape which we can use your formula. But now the balloon has a positive air pressure. Wouldn't that create a need to know the psi of the balloon to get an accurate mass measurement?",1

"This doesn't make sense to me you're calculating gravity by using  Substances such as air which have water molecules and water...... Air and water have a natural buoyancy.....

You cannot measure gravi because it doesn't existThe only way you can even think of measuring gravity is going outerspace and getting something big or small to measure the type of force which is placed on a object

Since we cannot do this and not even tried we cannot replicate gravity and since we cannot replicate gravity we can not say for sure if it exist in the 1st place

We know for sure even in space things can weigh-in have some mass to it but at that point we would need a force pushing down to measure it.....

It is one said when you are in the water are you wet when you're in it or wet when you come out

Same goes for gravi when you are in it is it I'll force or when you out of it is it forced on you

Everything gets pushed down equally but bigger things are heavier and smaller things are lighter the pending on the mass or the flatness

 A helium balloon rises and are Feather Falls where does gravi fit into this the balloon is wider in ways more then the feather but the air inside of it defeats gravity ????

Things done add up",1
"no no, the 'g' he used in mg is not referring to grams, but the acceleration due to gravity whose value is 9.8 m/s^2. The formula is Weight = Mass x Acceleration due to gravity. Which is Weight = Mass x 9.8 m/s^2",1

Just because they comment something that looks like fishing for likes doesn‚Äôt mean that they have no life or self esteem. It‚Äôs just for fun. And if you care so much on how you think I fish for likes and have no life, but why even bring it up. WHO CARES? Even if they know that the person is fishing for likes then why bring it up, to make you feel good. Why are you even bringing this up? For what good comes out of this apart from exposing someone pointlessly. Just to try to point and try to put a stereotype on everyone else. YouTube is for fun entertainment and learning.

What would be the value in farad for to plate of 1 meter squared at distance of 1 mm? Then, inserting an isolator material that keep the plates at same distance, how much more farad we would get? Assuming the best or the cheapest material. Then, adding an electrolyte, how much more farad we typically get? Finally, making the plate ""bumpy"" to increase surface area, like in super capacitors, how much improvement we realistically expect?

"‚Äã¬†¬† right, so published physics textbooks from, I presume, a well established university are all wrong and you're right? Do you have a source?",1
"‚Äã¬†¬† I was referring to all Physics sources that embody the established concepts of mainstream Physics and not those sources that dispute these established concepts or say otherwise. Still, I know this is a bold statement and that's because the established concepts of Physics are incorrect. Can you dispute what I have stated to the other person in regard to the concept of work and energy based on established university textbooks and what is your argument?

It is accepted that an external force transfers energy to an object anytime that an external force acts on the object. After all, work on the object cannot be done if the external force doesn't transfer energy to the object. It only makes sense that a greater external force on an object then would transfer a greater amount of energy to the object. But, this would mean there's a relationship between the amount of external force on an object and the amount of energy transferred to the object. Can you dispute this based on your established university textbooks or do you have an argument against this?",1
"¬†¬† why would I need to disprove that? there is a relationship between the amount of external force applied to an object and the amount of energy transferred to the object. When an external force is applied to an object, work is done on the object, which involves the transfer of energy to the object. The amount of work done on an object is directly proportional to the force applied and the distance over which the force is applied. Expressed in equation Work = Force x Distance

The unit of work is joules, which is the same as the unit of energy. Therefore, the amount of energy transferred to an object is also directly proportional to the force applied and the distance over which the force is applied. The more force that is applied to an object, the more energy will be transferred to it, assuming the distance over which the force is applied remains constant. In what source does it say otherwise?",1
"¬†¬† You agree that an external force transfers energy to an object in the case that the object is not displaced, but the work equation would have that no energy is transferred by the external force when the object is not displaced because no work is done? How do you account for or explain this discrepancy?",1
"‚Äã¬†¬† Sure, the equation is used to calculate the work done on an object when an external force acts on it and the equation shows that no work is done on an object if there is no displacement of the object that is caused by the external force. But, then there's the other aspect of work as it pertains to energy transferred. The work done on an object is the energy transferred to the object by an external force that is acting on it. The amount of work done on an object by an external force reflects the amount of energy transferred to the object. So, if you use the equation and it shows that no work is done on an object because the external force does not cause a displacement of the object then the equation would falsely show that no energy was transferred to the object by the external force. How do you account for this discrepancy that the equation would falsely show that no energy is transferred by an external force when the object is not displaced and that an external force transfers energy to an object that is not displaced?",1
¬†¬† do you have an alternative formula?,1
"¬†¬† You mean do I have an alternative equation for work? Of course, I do if that's what you mean and I have posted the equations all over Youtube videos comment sections. But, do you agree that this discrepancy is an issue or that it indicates that something is wrong?",1
"¬†¬† that's fascinating, are you planning on publishing that in an academic journal?",1
"¬†¬† Please do send the link to the paper when you publish it. 

The only way to know whether your theories are better than current theories are with time and research with proven results.

"The ""rate of change""? You don't speak with a respectably known language. You seem to have been creating new words for definitions that fit your concepts however you don't have any connection to the person who doesn't know anything yet. After all, the rate at which electricity flows is constant, as far as I've been told.  Frequency is  a constant, so how can you push the frequency any faster without changing it? So the rate of change to the direction of which the magnetic field is traveling or pointing relative to the charge traveling on its field, would be the frequency that makes up alternating current. 

Oh, and the more I think about it, shouldn't frequency of direct current be zero point five? You know, since it's half of the step to a complete sine wave? Sometimes, god gives you a sign? I think it's spelled sine. But who's able to claim godliness anyway when the word god is just that program in your head that dictates how you think, the fact that you do, and not much more? 

A kernel program.

So after we calculate the work - motor‚Äôs output and we have taken into account the electric energy input, then the remaining energy not converted to motor output is the core and copper losses 

THIS HAS NEVER INCLUDED CEMF which is always been described as  ‚Äòthe  generator effect‚Äô as a result of Friday‚Äôs law of induction, & Maxwell-Faraday law, in maxwells equations  

Remember the generator effect can‚Äôt come from NO WHERE we are told that energy can‚Äôt be created anywhere in the universe 
so we have a problem the CEMF is not put into the equation from I/O

In motor data sheet why is this subject not  found in the losses table? along with - copper losses, core losses, bearing losses
Eddy losses, hys losses, stray losses...
The CEMF is used on data sheets only as you have - to find the running RPM - loaded and unloaded.

Please respond ))


See link below for full equation 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/motor-efficiency


This has been talked about for hundreds of years in alternative energy groups it‚Äôs not a new problem, but the fact remains the generator effect (breaking toque) in a electric motor is not accounted for as a loss, yet lol.., the motor is moving backwards and induction is happening. So therefore as many have said this is how a system can be actually measured over unity - over 100% for I/O when it is included 
After all it didn‚Äôt come from nowhere, if it came from the input (which it did) it must be measured on the output!",1

I think there's something about the interaction of the hypothetical scenario where Static Friction exits but Kinetic Friction does not but I can't wrap my head around it.",1
How do I calculate the acceleration of a bowling ball going down a ramp (without slipping or kinetic friction) with an horizontal angle 'a'?,1
"When I increase the torque on my turntable the velocity stays constant, does this mean it's increasing the inertia?",1
Just wondering why did you use 2/5mr^2 when describing the moment of inertia as opposed to mr^2? Is 2/5 a constant for spheres?,1
"Aaaa-khem. 

1) Coefficient of (static/sliding) friction has nothing to do with area of contact, but only material and conditions of the surfaces. So, given ring and box having equal materials, they would have equal coefficients, even if a ring have minuscule area of contact.

2) ""the moment the box slips"" makes no sense. The forces that drive the motion are gravity and the reaction of the ramp (also dependent on gravity). The gravity force is just constant, it doesn't increase or change.

Either gravity-induced downslope force is high enough to overcome static friction and then all objects slide, or its not, and then the box is not sliding at all (ring might slide or not - its called ""rolling resistance"").

There is no such coefficient of friction that would allow box sliding while the ring is forced rolling.

Think of it in this way, if you need an intuition. Any system is trying to achieve minimal energy state the most direct way possible. WHY, OH WHY would energy go into torque when sliding option is open for the ring?",1

What's the only force gets stronger the further you are away from the source?


Torque!! (might have been easy to guess that in the context of this video, but it really stumps people)

"Hey I'm a high school physics student and I'm doing a project on the dynamics of slings (like David used on Goliath) and my physics teacher wants me to include stuff about torque.

I'm not really sure if torque even applies though, since my hand is in the center of the circle applying the centripetal force, instead of  perpendicular to the radius like in the door hinge example.

Can torque even apply?",1
"What region in the UK is her accent from? it's intoxicating...

Also, I think all 3 would arrive at the bottom at the same time. The ball and ring don't need to rotate, they can just slide down (if we assume our hypothetical ramp doesn't have friction).",1
As  Torque = Force x Distance (simplistically) wouldn't that mean the torque be insanely large due to the distance?,1
Won't the rotational motion of the box and the marble impart more velocity to the bodies due to the tendency to roll?,1
Wait... It that ring THE ring? The one ring to rule us all?,1
Do one on gyroscopes!,1

"I would challenge the outcome of the Ramp Race. If there is no kinetic friction on the ENTIRE ramp, then I do not believe there would not be any source of energy (torque)  to rotate the marble or the ring. Hence the initial kinetic energy of the ring or marble would not be converted to rotational energy in the marble or the ring. Also since the only forces acting on all three objects, absent kinetic friction, would be ""g"" (gravity) and air resistance, I think the ring would win the race because  it offers a smaller surface area for air molecules to act upon (drag), ignoring the effects the race because  it offers a smaller surface area for air molecules to act upon (drag), ignoring the effects of laminar flow and potential vortices. thoughts?",1

"***** Well, according to GR, the inertia has no part to play here, as there really is no force at play. The geodesics of the three objects just meet because mass bends space, the ball a little more than the feather, and the Earth a whole lot more than both. My whole point, i guess, was that if something is not measurable, does it mean it's not there. I deduct that there is a difference, no matter how small, between the moments the two objects touch down. What if there was a bigger difference between the masses of the two objects, over a larger distance? Is this the rule always?",1

"If there is static friction but no kinetic friction then you would have to nudge the box to get it to move at all. If nudging the box is not required for some reason, then what is stopping the ring and marble from sliding without rolling? Why does the static friction require the ring and marble to roll but not require the box to be nudged?
This hypothetical ramp isn't self consistent. 

My answer: the marble will win because the box will be stuck at the top of the ramp.",1

Since buoyancy is the resultant force from a difference in pressure, can I conclude that the cylinder in the second situation experiences a larger buoyancy force than that of the first situation because of its orientation?",1

"I personally think centrifugal force is real.  It isn't the actor in the scenario, but it doesn't have to be to be a real force. The travelling body is exhibiting a force because of its otherwise linear inertia resisting the accelerating force.  Every force has an equal and opposite counter force. Centripetal force is the acting force. Centrifugal force is the inertial counter force to this acting force. Force, counterforce, I see no issue here. 

This also simplifies tidal mechanics. Why do physicists so complicate things just to get rid of the centrifugal force.",1
"I still dont understand why centrifugal force isnt real, isnt the tangential motion thing exactly that? The only reason that key stays there is because its attatched to a rope, and it stays at the end of the rope and the roap stays horizontal instead of falling limp is because the tangental forces push it outwards right? So there is a force going outwards, and on a carosel you stay on because you are sitting on somethg and/or holding on to a bar, if you stood on a spinning platform without anything to hold you once you reached a certain speed it would be a real struggle to stay on, because without anything pulling you in you body wants to follow the tangential force.

Similarly satelites have to go a certain speed to stay in orbit, too slow and gravity will pull them inward, but too fast and theyl break orbit.
So basically tangential force is hapening constantly as an object is being spun around a point pushing things outwards tangential to the circular motion...

"What is a resistor? How does current branch in a network of resistors? How does it ""know"" how much should flow in each branch?
While some detail is given in science and engineering courses about conductors, insulators and semiconductors, resistance is described in¬†several ways.
Examples include i.¬†The restriction to the flow of electrons. ii. The difficulty in moving electrical current through a conductor to which voltage is applied.
iii. a circuit element which dissipates energy in the form of heat .
More appropriate description for a resistor would be¬†the¬†property¬†of a conductor which determines the current produced by a given difference of potential.
This makes us remember that a resistor is a conductor first. And, there is reason to say that superconductive wires dont obey ohm's law. So all conductors are resistive, though not superconductors.
Resistors are used in circuits to regulate the strengths of currents either by¬†reducing the diameter of conductors or introducing more obstacles or lattice imperfections¬†to reduce the strength of current.
The current branches in a parallel network by an elaborate rearrangement of surface charge.
Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science and not two, that of electricity and magnetism. 
It will be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level¬† as in the following two videos: 
i. https://youtu.be/TTtt28b1dYo and 
ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo 
The last frame References in video #1 lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss details about resistance, how current branches in a parallel circuit and ohm's law.

How does current know how to split in parallel branches?
To answer this question one must know the role of surface charges in establishing a current and potential difference in a circuit. 
Supposing there is  a simple series circuit comprising a battery, wires and a resistor R1 and there is a dead-end branch with a resistor R2 across R1. When the circuit is made then initially electrons flow into both branches, but the surface of the dead-end branch becomes charged so negatively that no more electrons can enter. This prevents current flowing into the dead-end branch.
Current of appropriate strength will flow in the R2 branch when the branch is connected across R1. It is not possible in this post to discuss in more detail the rearrangement of surface charges which allows current through the branch.

The last frame References in video #1  lists textbooks 3 and 4 which discuss surface charges and explains their rearrangement with the help of sequential diagrams in parallel circuits.",1

"You could also go into horizontally launched projectiles.

Let's say bob kicks a ball 10m/s on a 100m cliff 45 degrees. How far does it go?

 So the velocity in the y would be sin(45)*10m/s and the velocity in the x would be cos(45)*10m/s

y = 8.509m/s
x = 5.253m/s

Now that we have the velocity in the y (8.509m/s)
We will make a height vs time function.

The double antiderivative of -9.8m/s is -4.9x^2 so

-4.9x^2 + 8.5x + 100 = 0
now we use the quadratic formula(-b¬±‚àö(b¬≤-4ac))/(2a)

and get a result of: 5.4s

It will take 5.6 seconds to reach the bottom. Now we need to multiply this with the velocity in the x (5.253m/s) and we get our distance

D = 28.665M (5.6 * cos(45)*10m/s)",1

Hello first of all let me thank you because I learned a lot from you but in case i think you have a mistake on this sum .if you leave with 120volt and you subtract 4.616 and x10  comes 73.85v how come  the other side you have 55.38v ? the voltage total don't add up because if you leave with 120v you need to finish 120v right and 73.85+55.35=129.23 right and how can be u step up in voltage?

"Try to think of it this way: suppose the wheel is rolling forward (to the right). The wheel turns clockwise, from our perspective. As a point on the wheel closes in on the bottom of the wheel, its velocity vector that says it is moving around the center of the wheel points to the left. But the whole wheel (that point included) should also have a velocity vector directed to the right.

As a result of this, points that are in contact with the surface have a net velocity of the sum of -v_tangential and +v_translational. If the wheel is rolling ""without slipping,"" those speeds should equal one another in magnitude, and cancel out when adding them.

This also means that points at the top of the wheel are moving with speed 2v, and the points on the far left and right of the wheel are moving along the horizontal axis with just speed v.

Did that clear it up?",1

It may be easier to understand if you look at the channel itself rather than at the video. ""CrashCourse"" is a business concept ... they have many different series of Crash Courses ... like ""Crash Course Economy"", ""Crash Course Psychology"", ""Crash Course Physics"", etc. (572 videos total).

The idea of ""compressed information"" have probably worked well for some of those courses ... based on the 4.5 million subscribers ... and now they assume that it will work for everything. I don't believe in the same idea.

So the video is about people trying to copy a ""success formula"" (their own formula or one they have got from others). It's about organized video production.

One comment identified it as ""edutainment"" ... about giving people the cognitive illusion of understanding the content. I believe he was talking about the general idea there.",1
"+CrashCourse Nick J.
More than half of the current comments are directly or indirectly about ""speaking too fast"".

* I pointed out that it may have been designed for a very specific group of people.

If it has, then I believe you should clarify that ... for example ""these physics crash courses have been specifically designed for students, and the intention is to cover [what the intention is?] in a short amount of time"".

But I had to guess. The idea that it could have been designed for specific groups of people was one of many guesses.

* It can also have been designed to be used in a specific way ... for example that the meaning is that people should start from ""Course #1"" and then work their way up to ""Course #11"" to get the full meaning.

* My third guess was that ""this has worked well for other crash courses ... 4.5 million subscribers and 572 videos"" ... that it was about people trying to follow some type of ""success formula"".

Can you clarify what the course is about ... the intended audience and the intended use of the courses?",1

"baby pancakes angular velocity is rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time. 

Say a minute hand moves five minutes from 12 to 1.
Hence, the angle displaced from 12 to 1  is: 1/12(360) = 30 degrees

So now we have angular displacement( the change in angle from a starting point, in this case the 12) 

Since angular velocity = d(theta)/dt, where theta is the angular displacement which we have found (30 degrees),

we now need to find the time. So how long does it take for the minute hand to move from 12 to 1? (5mins=300seconds) 

hence angular velocity , omega= rad/s

since 30 degrees is pi/6, therefore 

angular velocity = (pi/6)/300secs",1

Okay, then gravity isn't a force either. It's a consequence of geometry. Are you going to get upset if someone calls gravity a force at any time after like 1920? I guess electricity and magnetism aren't forces either, because they're actually quantum field interactions. You're mixing different levels of physics together, which you shouldn't do. What formalism do you want to use? Classical mechanics or statistical mechanics? Pick just one. Forces aren't real. We made them up. If someone wants to invent a force called friction, they can do that, and we actually see it. If it causes a change in acceleration, it's a force.",1
"to break this down to its most basic and simplest of components. the only question which will give an accurate answer to my confusion is. If you push on a stationary object such as a wall in a strait line to the flat surface. is that called friction. if not than friction is not itself a force because its the exact same principles which gives objects ""Friction""",1
"+crystal kalem 
I'm not sure what you mean to be honest. Do mean wether  intermolecular bonds within the wall perpenticular to your direction of pushing and the friction between wall and floor are the same thing? 
Tbh. in the end it doesn't matter. A ""force"" is already an abstraction of the real world. It's a modell. It's up to you what you define as a force, as long as the outcome is right :)
Or to put it this way: A force, as well as velocity, acceleration (and others) are vectors. Which means they not only have a quantity (such as 10N), they also have direction. (Thats why she always draws arrows, this wouldn't make much sense with weight for example).
Now go and find a vector in nature. It's not possible. You will never have a 2-dimensional something in nature.",1

"Sir Isaac Newton. One of the greatest physicists ever who said: ‚ÄúIf I have seen further, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants‚Äù.  We know about Isaac Newton very well, but we do not recognize the ‚ÄòGiants‚Äô. We are aware of the famous picture of Isaac Newton, where he is seen experimenting with light. But we are not aware that the same experiment was done by Ibn al-Haytham more than seven centuries before him.

Muslim scientists such as Thabit ibn Qurra and Ibn al-Haytham wrote about calculus. We know of Ibn al-Haytham and his writings about gravity. Abu Bakr al-Razi, centuries before Newton, made a strong distinction between absolute and relative space; absolute space, which is three dimensional and infinite, exists quite independently of the bodies contained in it. And Ibn Sina tried to relate velocity with weight, which is a precursor to the concept of momentum. These discoveries are all connected to Newton.


Let‚Äôs look at Newton‚Äôs laws of motion. Ibn Sina and Ibn al-Haytham, among others, are seen to be writing about Newton‚Äôs law of inertia, the first law of motion. Abul Barakat Al-Baghdadi writes that force is proportional to acceleration, which we get to know from the second law. Ibn Bajja wrote that for every force there is a reaction force, which became the forerunner to Newton‚Äôs third law of motion.

So how do so many things that Newton worked come to light as being described by Muslim scientists long before his discoveries?

The ‚ÄòGiants‚Äô they say, are Copernicus, Kepler, Descartes, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo. But actually, it just might be that Sir Isaac Newton was influenced by Muslim scientists.

ADVERTISE ON TMV

In his writings, there are clear marks of influence from Ibn Tufail‚Äôs philosophical romance Hayy ibn Yaqzan (Alive Son of Awaken). It is known that both the Latin and English translations of the book by Edward Pococke and Simon Ockley  were available at Isaac Newton‚Äôs time. Ibn Tufail‚Äôs influence is seen in other philosophers, scientists, and fiction authors of the time too.

The talented man he was, Ibn al-Haytham‚Äôs name is frequent. Isaac Newton even kept a copy of Ibn al-Haytham‚Äôs magnum opus, Kitab al-Manazir in his personal library.

Many laugh at Jabir ibn Hayyan for his alchemy, considering it irrational. Jabir ibn Hayyan didn‚Äôt try to create gold out of silly stuff without a system; rather his process was more scientific and experimental. Many people in fact, get shocked when they find out that Sir Isaac Newton also practiced alchemy. And, he didn‚Äôt only practice alchemy, he read Jabir‚Äôs book and was influenced by it. A book called Summa Perfectionis was based on the Arabic work Kitab al-Mulk, from the Jabirian Corpus. It was translated into English by Richard Russell, and appeared in three other versions, one of which was Willam Starkey‚Äôs Secrets Reveal‚Äôd, the one which Newton owned.

So, perhaps, Newton‚Äôs ideas didn‚Äôt fall from an apple tree after all. Perhaps they fell from the great minds of Muslim scientists before him.

in relation to the laws of physics with a round disk full of information.
I will try to explain what I mean. A record will turn at a set speed say 45 RPM.
how can the center or near center turn at the same speed as the outer perimeter and arrive back to the start at the same time as the outer?
Or let say if you walked around the inner circle of your town at 12 miles per hour
from a starting point and at the same time someone else walked around the outer circle of your town
at the exact speed 12 miles per hour who would have completed the walk first.
I think logic would say, well you would because you had less distance to walk as you were on
the inner circle. I hope you're still with me? So now if you place a record on a turntable
and drew a white line from the center to the outer edge then switch on the rotation at 45 RPM the inner circle will arrive back at the starting point the exact same time as the outer circle.? how can this be possible.

F = (N/m2c2 x c x c) / m2

F = N x 1/m2 x c4 x 1/m2

"Scientists are the problem. They are considered mainstream only if their theories are based on phenomena. 
Example: Gravity is considered a phenomenon. It is considered a phenomenon because we cant explain it. Because it doesn't work and it doesn't exist. If it did exist, we would certainly have discovered it by now. However, instead of making the Logical conclusion that we need a real Force. We continue for 200 years with this force. Gravity does not even explain Gravity.  Lot alone anything else in our universe. 
We do not correct the error. What we do is add another phenomenon to explain the first phenomena such as dark matter. Then when that failed they created another phenomenal dark energy. 
That is science now?
You cannot use a phenomenon to explain the phenomenon that explains phenomena.

in relation to the laws of physics with a round disk full of information.
I will try to explain what I mean. A record will turn at a set speed say 45 RPM.
how can the center or near center turn at the same speed as the outer perimeter and arrive back to the start at the same time as the outer?
Or let say if you walked around the inner circle of your town at 12 miles per hour
from a starting point and at the same time someone else walked around the outer circle of your town
at the exact speed 12 miles per hour who would have completed the walk first.
I think logic would say, well you would because you had less distance to walk as you were on
the inner circle. I hope you're still with me? So now if you place a record on a turntable
and drew a white line from the center to the outer edge then switch on the rotation at 45 RPM the inner circle will arrive back at the starting point the exact same time as the outer circle.? how can this be possible.

why force given by ground on reindeer is more?,1
uhh is a moose a reindeer?,1
"Let's sum up the forces exerted ON each of the objects, ok? Take the sled first: you have gravity, the normal force from the ground, and the pull of the reindeer. But the normal force cancels out gravity, and the only uncanceled one is the pull, so the sled accelerates forward.
noe lets condider the reindeer: gravity and normal force cancel out, but then you have the pull from the sled pulling it back, and the reaction force the it gets from the ground as it pushes backwards with its hoofs. If it pushes backwards on the ground, then the force from the ground will push it forwards. However, you still have the  sled pulling the reindeer back.
So the effectice forces on the reindeer ate the pull from the sled and the push from the ground. To move forward, all the reindeer needs to do is push back on the ground with more force thab the sled pulls it back.
There is one force we haven't considered though. What are the effects on the ground of the push that the reindeer makes? Certainly if it pushes backwards on the ground, and there is nothing to cancel it out, the ground must move backwards. And it does! it's just that the Earth is so massive, it barely ecen notices that tiny push.",1

I have a 44 magnum desert eagle that fires very large bullets and a relatively low muzzle velocity.
Don't you agree that my smaller .223 rifle could create the SAME RECOIL as the desert eagle IF it can get the smaller bullet to much higher velocity than the 44 magnum?",1

NASA is launching a rocket into space from Earth. This particular rocket burns its fuel for 5 minutes and 
then turns off its engines. At this point, the rocket keeps floating along through space at a speed of 10 
km/s.


a.) What is the rocket‚Äôs average acceleration during these first 5 minutes? 


b.) How far did the rocket travel during the first 5 minutes?


c.) The Moon is approximately 3.8 x 10^5km from Earth. At its final speed, how long will it take the rocket to reach the Moon? 



d.) The star nearest to us, called Alpha Centauri, is 4.1 x 10^13 km away. Could this rocket get a man to Alpha Centauri before he dies of old age?



e.) The rocket is half way to the Moon when its pilot suddenly notices he forgot his camera! He radios a second rocket crew on Earth and tells them to bring his camera and meet him on the Moon when he lands. Unfortunately, the second rocket can only accelerate at 3 m/s^2. Can this second rocket make it to the Moon before the first one lands?",1

A small research rocket of mass 250kg is launched vertically as part of a weather study. It sends out 50 kg of burnt fuel and exhaust gases with a velocity of 180 ms-1 in a 2 s initial acceleration period.
(a)  What is the velocity of the rocket after this initial acceleration?  (Answer v = 40 ms-1)
(b)  What upwards force does this apply to the rocket?  (Answer  F =  4500N)

And if there are three significant digits, would the true velocity range be 200.1 *(1¬±0.005) or 200*(1¬±0.005)? I would imagine that 0.5% is also an estimate too, which only has three significant digits.

I have another question. What if we perform multiple operations in a row, for example 15,4 : 50 x 163,72?

Is magnetic field of solenoid independent of the cross-sectional area of the solenoid?",1
"If the magnetic strength is always in relation to the number of turns per meter, then it seems like increasing the number of turns of wire would have no effect on the strength of the magnet. Assuming the diameter of the wire is unchanged and it can't be coiled any tighter, then increasing the number of turns will increase the length proportionally and they will cancel out. In your example, N=1,500 and l is 5cm, so n=30,000, but if N doubles to 3,000, then l will also double to 10cm and n is still 30,000 and the magnetic force doesn't change. How can this be right?",1

why would the field outside the solenoid be zero?,1

What reaction the flow rates in fluid.,1
Thank you for the comprehensive explanation. I have a question regarding your solution of (b). I did not get the whole explanation of multiplying the change of time by the change in flow rate to get the change of mass. Why did not you simply multiply the 106 by 600 (10 minutes) and you will get the same solution 63 600 as simple as this. I would love to know your justification,1
"Maybe I don't understand exactly what you're doing, but isn't temperature an integral component of mass flow?",1
how did you get 106 kg/s ? its really frustrating :(,1
by any chance were you able to find a good video that would help a thermo student understand flow rate?,1
How would you handle a problem where there were two different pieces of metals with different specific heat capacities?,1
did you ever find out? I need to know too :'),1

would both the q of pot and q of water be released to lead? or would it be just the one with the higher heat capacity",1

So if you have a constant flow rate and constant pressure in say of 10bar air passing through, how much in comparison could be drawn through?",1
"Nice and a wonderful explanation..... However, I went through the calculations but I did not understand how you calculated the area of the diameters of the pipe and the venturi. Is there any explanation to give to that please",1

Question how to find Z1-Z2 ? Explain please,1
what would happen to the pipe if the speed at point B surpasses the max speed(with max speed being  the speed that makes H2=0 ),1
Good video. I'm confused why the p2 would be less than p1 though. The level of the liquid in the 2nd tube is lower so how come it hasn't got more pressure?,1
How do you find the height different in the water tubes,1
"where did that 1000 came from sir? I'm so confused
 rho=1000?",1
why is change in pressure p1-p2 rather than p2-p1,1
Could you induce as much as say 1/2 the constant volume in through the venturi?,1
"how on earth did 1/2 minus 1/2 became 1? , I can't hear the video clearly , you said if we factor 1/2 rho v1  squared you have 1? (4:27)",1
What about V2?,1

How do you find work in an isothermal process if temperature is not known,1
"I don't see how you can find that W=Integral(P*dV) where P is Constant. And then when you find W=nRTln(Vf/Vi), you assume P is not constant and substitute in Pi/Pf. If P is constant, how can you substitute in Pi/Pf?",1
what if we do not have gas and we have i liquid for example what equation we need ?,1
pls tell me how did you calculate q2 4:36 üò•its only positive,1
In 2nd question gas is being compressed meaning work is being done on gas so W should be positive right? and in 1st question gas is doing the work so W should be negative. Can anyone explain me why? Or is he referring surrounding for symbols and not system. ,1

"So, 
1. Electric field inside a conductor is zero.
2.. A capacitor works by creating an electric field between 2 oppositely charged plates.
3. When u place a positive charge inside a conductor, The electric field at the centre of the conductor is still zero. But there is an electric field between the centre and the negatively charged shell. Moreover, the entire conductor surface is now positively charged and generates an electric field to the outside...
Okay, so I guess when I put a negative charge at the centre of a positively charged conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, charges are rearranged so that the conductor is now negatively charged.
Well,what happens if I put a negative charge at the centre of a negatively charged conductor?",1

At 05:00 you say that there is an isothermal process where heat is slowly added, but the animation shows lots of heat (Q_H) escaping. What gives?

At 05:04 You say that the isothermal expansion is 1/2 AB. Shouldn't it be the entire path AB?
 
At 05:15 you say ""the temperature drops whilst the heat stays constant, which also makes the volume expand"". Well this is misleading: a temperature drop would cause an isolated system volume to contract. However in a Carnot engine, the system is doing work on the atmosphere, converting internal energy into work, and dropping the temperature. It's best to say that the expansion work drops the temperature, not that a colder temperature causes an expansion.

Also, when you keep saying ""the heat stays constant"", shouldn't you be saying ""there is no heat flow"" or something equivalent?

At 05:40 you say ""the heat doesn't change"" but perhaps you should be saying that there is no heat flow, or the system is thermally insulated, or something else equivalent.

The way you explain it sounds as if heat is a state property, when it's not.",1

Do you use an independent mic (eg an  USB one)?
Do you then record the whole screen session from your PC, or do you have a specific software that lets you record only the vide itself from the E-drawer?

"A CONSIDERATION. 
11:00 min
Action/ REACTION 
Note how 100 newtons of applied force becomes experienced by both sides, in effect BECOMING doubled. 
100 newtons creates 200 newtons, 
100 per party. 
Where did the extra 100 newtons come from?
It could well be that it is wrong, albeit consistently wrong, and that each body, in fact experiences only 50 newtons each. 
Objectively, nothing changes, SUBJECTIVELY our   numbers are off by 50%.
Think about it. The values are just numbers which, in and of themselves mean nothing. 
Rather it is our experience of the numbers that COUNTS. 
Ie. When you go to the gym and pump some iron, you experience the values that we quantify as numbers. 
What is the difference if you designate a weight as 100 or 1000 X? Which, nevertheless changes the instant you travel to another planet with a different gravity rating. 
What COUNTS is our experience, 
how heavy or light it FEELS when we experience it. We use the numbers to QUANTITY our SUBJECTIVE experience.

"Hey guys, I have a genuine and frustrating problem I'm trying to figure out so I can start to model. ---How is just the exhaust sound from a car come from? (Yes, i know feom the individual explosions that are happening inside the combustion chamber, but its more complex). Also, why if your not in the right gear going up hill, and even tho your RPM hasn't changed, as you give it more gas,  the engine note changes. ( besides the obvious answer because you're giving it more gas there's a more complex answer). And finally, what makes a Ferrari V8 sound SO different that a Chevy or Ford V8, excluding size and exhaust layout.  I have an hypothesis. We will focus on one cylinder of an Engine of your choosing.  Engine takes in air and fuel, its compressed to around 120psi, ignition, rise and heat are produced and the piston gets pushed down, ( (very simple introduction). However , as the piston is at bottom dead center and before the exhaust valve opens, there still remains a calculatable pressure that remains.  Due to a volume of air now hotter than originally, there is still pressure inside the chamber. When the exhaust valve opens, rapidly even at idle and the piston is thruster upward, thoes hot exhaust gases, as hot as 50psi, are forced into the exhaust system and out the tailpipe. Now 50psi being forces out a narrow tube in ,even as low as .06 sec, is bound to ""carry a tone""  what do u think",1

The question to ask is a little different: is the red-shift because of the expansion of space, or because it's actually moving relative to us? This is not binary, of course... we know the local galaxies are approaching us because of our gravity (and determined by the blue-shift), just as some of the red-shift is from the expansion from the ""big bang"" itself.

"What is electric current?

What is electric current? Electrons flow in a conductor?

How do electrons flow in a conductor? Like many cars driving down the highway? Or is water flowing in warer pipe? What is a highway in a conductor? What is the water pipe in the conductor? Why don't electrons flow to the positively charged nucleus? What magic keeps electrons away from the nucleus?

Is the speed of electrons flowing in copper wire the speed of light? If not, how could electricity travel at the speed of light? If so, how can electrons accelerate at the speed of light?

In fact, Atoms are not made from charged particles as scientists told. 

All atoms consist of indestructible, electrically charged multiple layers hollow sphere and internally charged solid sphere. Outside each atom is a layer of negatively charged liquid that scientists mistaken for electrons.

This negative charged liquid attaches to non-metal atoms due to their outer layer is positively charged and floats on metal atoms due to their outer layer is negatively charged. The floating liquid of a conductor conducts electricity.

Electricity is flow in conductor 
instantaneously, similar to hydraulic fluid flow through hydraulic systems. 

The voltage of the electricity is proportional to the speed at which the floating liquid moves.",1

"See I look at the difference this way: All scalar quantities need only one poin to exist. That point is valued according to zero. Vectors must have two points and they don't have to respect zero. 

For example: acceleration needs an initial point and a point to which you want to compare. How much did the the vehicle accelerate from 30mph to 40mph. Vectors use scalars to work.

On the other hand: speed needs one point and compares relative to zero. The man walked 10mph. 10mph is 10mph from zero. You could say the man ran 5mph faster than he walks, but you are still starting from as your initial speed you are adding to is referenced from zero.",1

"How does a voltage develop across the unconnected end of a single wire connected to one terminal of a battery and the other terminal? 

If the battery‚Äôs net charge is zero, then for a 12 V battery, one terminal would be at a potential of +6 V with respect to a conductor at infinity, while the other terminal would be at ‚Äì6 V. At the physical center in the space between the two terminals of the battery, the voltage is zero.
If we then connect a small wire to, say, the positive terminal, a few excess point charges will move onto the wire, and that wire will now be at the same potential as the battery terminal: +6 V. The wire will be surrounded by an e-field, and since the lines of electrostatic flux must always terminate upon charges, the wires must possess an excess surface charge. 

In the above we assumed the net charge of the battery was zero. Supposing that the battery had a net charge. Then how would the charges, potentials and voltage be changed? 

Before we answer this, it would be instructive to understand Current, the conduction process and Voltage at the fundamental level.
Electrostatics and circuits belong to one science not two as in the following two videos:
i. https://youtu.be/REsWdd76qxc and 
ii. https://youtu.be/8BQM_xw2Rfo 

Returning to our question of the voltage of the single wire connected to one battery terminal,¬† we assume the net charge of the battery was not initially zero. Perhaps someone with rubber-sole shoes carried the battery while walking on a wool carpet or perhaps the battery was charged to ‚Äì5000 V, and would deliver a tiny spark if touched. In that case one terminal would still be 12 V different than the other terminal, perhaps ‚Äì5000 V on the positive terminal and ‚Äì5012 V on the negative. 

It is not possible in this brief post to discuss in more detail the process of production of the voltage of the single wire without a detailed discussion of the capacitance and potential of single conductors.
The last frame References in video #1¬† lists textbook 4 which discusses these topics comprehensively using a unified approach and provides an intuitive understanding of voltage of a single short and long wire with and without a net charge on the battery.",1

"*THE EXACT PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE CREATION OF THE WIRE'S MAGNETIC FIELD*

Current flow does not cause the magnetic field creation.  Not in the way people think.

In a 12 gauge copper wire (2mm diameter), at 1 amp, a single electron moves  only 
0.000023 meters per second.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity#Numerical_example

I'm going to figure out the exact physical nature of the magnetic field around the wire.  A couple things stand out:

1)  there are no electrons flowing down the wire.  How long will it take one electron in a 1 amp, 12 gauge wire to move one meter?  
Distance = Rate x Time.   
1 meter = .000023 meters/second  x  Time.
Time =   1 meter /  .000023 meters/second = 43,478 seconds = 742.64 minutes =  12.1 hours

""But that's just one electron.  There's millions of electrons.  You forgot about that.""  
No.  Every electron is traveling slower than frozen molasses,  .000023 meters/second, 1 meter in 12.1 hours.

So moving electrons do not create the magnetic field.  The magnetic field appears INSTANTLY the moment power is turned on (speed of light, just like the electric field) and the electrons are taking 12.1 hours to move only one meter.

And it's not the random movement of electrons either - the magnetic field around the wire would be random in that case, and the field is not random.

2)  the orientation of the (rotating) magnetic field around the wire is the same every time - right hand rule.

3)  it is a north magnetic pole - every time power is on.  
      
I'm starting there.  The suspicion is that the field gradient is part of the reason for the consistency of the magnetic pole being north consistently.",1

by putting I1 = 2I2 in the statement 
it's going to be 2 i2 + i2 is equal to 6
that means 3 * i2 is equal to 6

4:32 how to increase the voltage/current?,1
Can you tell  solveig how battery generate electric field ?,1
Did you find out the answer?,1
" this is pretty late, but if you're still wondering how to get 5 J from a 5V battery here you go.

If you know how many volts you have and you want to know how many joules of energy your circuit is using it also requires knowing the resistance of the circuit and the time.  

Let's simplify your question by saying you have a 1 V battery and want to know what conditions would supply 1 J of energy.

1 Joule of energy (E) is dissipated by using 1 watt of power (P) for 1 second (t); E=P√ót

1 Watt is the amount of electrical work performed when 1 ampere of current (I) flows across a potential difference of 1 volt (V). P=I√óV

1 Ampere is equal to 1 volt over a resistance (R) of 1 ohm; I=V/R.

By substituting you can combine these formulas into one:
I=V/R and P=I√óV therefore P= V^2/R.
P= V^2/R and E=P√ót therefore E=V^2√ót/R.

So, in order for a 1V battery to supply 1J of energy, it has to be connected to a circuit drawing 1 amp of current across a 1 ohm resistor for 1 second.  

If you want a 5 volt battery to supply 5 joules,  you have to change the values of the resistance and/or time so that the math in the formula E=V^2√ót/R comes out to be 5 joules. For example, 5 volts across 5 ohms for 1 second, 5 volts across 10 ohms for 2 seconds, etc.

"I suppose the best that can be said about this video is that the presenter paid close attention in his science classes and faithfully memorized all the material the teacher(s) presented. Unfortunately, it's also obvious that he's not given so much as one minute of thought at to what he's parroting back from those classes.

This explanation of sound fails at such a cursory and basic level that it's both a crime and a sin that it's allowed to be taught this way in schools. Students deserve better.

This comment will outline just a couple of the many errors in the teaching of sound. For simplicity only sound in air will be considered.

The notion of sound as alternating compressions and rarefactions being ""pushed out"" by a sound source leads to a question that must be asked (but, never is). Why don't those compressions (air particles being pushed closer together) and rarefactions (air particles being...somehow...made to be further apart. Just how not being explained) can persist in the air for at least several seconds, without diffusing and fading out within a few feet at most?

After all, it you create a fairly massive rarefaction by sucking air into your lungs and taking it out of the immediate atmosphere and then making a compression by blowing the air out. How long do those rarefactions and compressions persist when blowing out the candles on a birthday cake? Or blowing out the candles (or at least trying to blow them out) from 5 feet away?

How much compression and rarefaction is there from a vocal cord moving perhaps a few thousandths of an inch for even loud talking or yelling. 

How does the sound take off at the speed of sound (standard conditions about 760 mph) when the vocal cords are moving at typically less than one mph? You seem proud to be a math whiz' calculate the speed of something you can fairly easily measure, like the motion of a loudspeaker cone.

You must at least get it that a loud sound from a vocal cord or loudspeaker requires it to move faster than with a soft sound. The 'device' moving a greater distance in the same amount of time for the same pitch or frequency of sound when the sound is louder.

If the sound source is moving at different speeds (both due to loudness but also from harmonic content), why don't the rarefactions and compressions run into each other and muddle up the sound? How is it that even from a considerable distance, sound can retain that harmonic content, making the sound easily recognizable?

Some of these questions were asked in a video I made. But, the purpose of the video was not to teach science but to get permissions from Caltech for use of some of their copyrighted material. You can see the video here:

https://youtu.be/4kTLMiGgnqs

What is the mechanism for the sound taking off at 760 mph from less than a 1 mph emitting surface?

The teaching of sound in school science classes is just one fairy tale after another.

One of those fairy tales is the Decibels. The notion that sound is emitted as energy and thus must follow an inverse square law falloff rate. When, even the most obtuse moron can clearly tell that it doesn't, the mathematical physicist still continues to unmercifully beat that dead horse with the mathematics of logarithms, and coming up with the most ridiculous answers and presenting them with a straight face:

https://youtu.be/R5rkg8mTRBI

I guess my advice would be to actually think this issue of sound through...at least a little bit...before making a 3 1/2 hour video about it.

"i have a question,.since U and.PE.are connotations for.potential energy, why do they yield.different.results? i tried solving the potential energy for.each capacitor by using two equations pe=qv, and U=1/2cv2, but they yield different results. Correct me if there are errors in what I did. Pls help. Why is it that the result of U is always half of the result of PE when they should have the same answer.",1
