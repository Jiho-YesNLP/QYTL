# QYTL: Questions in YouTube Lectures
## ðŸ“– Abstract
We created the YouTube Learners' Questions on Bloom's Taxonomy Dataset (YouLeQD), which contains learner-posed questions from YouTube lecture video comments. Along with the dataset, we developed two RoBERTa-based classification models leveraging Large Language Models to detect questions and analyze their cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy. This dataset and our findings provide valuable insights into the cognitive complexity of learner-posed questions in educational videos and their relationship with interaction metrics. This can aid in the development of more effective AI models for education and improve the overall learning experience for students.
